Grilled beef dog on a pretzel bun with beer queso, sauerkraut, mustard and sweet sauteed onions.

And it took me until Saturday to get there, but the wait was worth it. The dog was tasty and super fattening and very messy. The queso and the pretzel bun were awesome, but about three quarters of the way through, it collapsed. Still, very tasty.

Get a seat upstairs if the weather is great!),(Saw a picture of the dog of the week on Twitter. It was enough to make me leave my house and drive to JJ's immediately. Seriously, I didn't even take the time to change out of my pajamas.

This week's dog: Pork and Greens. Sauteed collard greens, bacon, red onion and pumpkin mustard. Collard greens just make everything better. Go get this. Delicious.

My other dog: The Char Heel. Chili, slaw, onions, mustard. You can never go wrong with this Carolina classic.

The two dog deal comes with a side (I went with the beans. They were good, but I wish I had went with onion rings. Rookie mistake) and a drink for less than ten bucks.

Workers were friendly. Didn't take long at all to get my food. I believe it took longer to try to bust a left turn out of the parking lot. Oh East Blvd, you win every time.

This spot has been a revolving door of places for years. It's nice to see something stick here. Cheers to JJ's!),(Ok. After trying several rounds of the ""Dog of the Week,"" I'll sell my soul for another one of them. The varieties that came out of the minds of local beer aficionados like Chris from Good Bottle, Jason from Salud, and dudes from OMB, Birdsong, or Daniel from CharlotteBeer, I'm hooked. It's what I look forward to the most upon each visit. 

Recently, I checked out the dog with peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon. Ummm....yeah. I almost lost my mind it was so good. Anything that even slightly breathes that side of Thai\/Vietnamese flavor. 

Also, summertime calls for a nice, tall orangeade. The Arnold Palmer variety is rather refreshing, too. Not too sweet and ever-so perky. 

Winner, winner!)"

My favorite, still to this day, is the Dill Pickle. It's perky and matches the flavor name rather well. A nice change from the same old plain or buttered\/salted varieties. 

They have a few different sizes to choose from. All are really affordable and would work perfectly for a potluck dinner or cookout. Or whatever. Hell, I'd just buy a bag to celebrate whatever day of the week it was. So. Good.

QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw,"French, Restaurants",Charlotte,0,35.19508,-80.825792,Lumiere French Kitchen,140,4.5,"(I spent forever trying to figure out where I wanted to dine for one of my last meals in Charlotte after traveling down on business for the last 1.5 years.  After throwing out many options, we finally chose Lumiere the menu was very intriguing.  I suppose I had very high expectations for Lumiere given the rave Yelp reviews and the solid menu, but after trying a few things I've decided it was good, but doesn't quite go down in my book of Charlotte restaurants as being a ""must try"".

The seating here was very comfortable; we were given a huge booth for two people.  It was pretty quiet on a Tuesday evening, but the atmosphere was still uppity enough for it not to be too quiet.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful - liked him a lot!

We were presented with a guyere-filled bread and a cute baby cup of delicious butternut squash soup as an amuse bouche - great start to the meal. 

We started off with a few small plates - the local half dozen oysters were good, but probably not the best I've had.  I guess I'm just used to having my oysters with the usual condiments, which they sadly did not have (though I'm told good oysters don't need condiments - I'm just a sucker for routine).  The escargot was okay - the breading was a little overpowering with butter taste and I was kind of expecting the usual escargot presentation with garlickly oil to soak my bread in.  Still decent, though.  The FOIE GRAS was where it was at.  This was 100% the best dish of the night.  They gave us a healthy, healthy serving of nicely cooked foie gras with a delicious cooked date on the side.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.

As for entrees, we got the duck l'orange and the sea scallops.  The sea scallops were a bit salty but nicely cooked.  I wasn't quite a fan of the risotto.  I also noticed that the scallops dish was very, very hot.  All of it basically burned my tongue which was a bit weird... never really had that happen before.  The duck, in my opinion, was my second favorite dish.  It was cooked to a nice medium temperature and wasn't too salty and the sweet orange sauce complemented the saltiness very well.

The value is pretty decent - given all the dishes (all relatively large portions) we ordered plus a couple glasses of wine, we were surprised to see our bill was much more affordable than we thought.

Lumiere is worth a try for some decent French food, but I would stick with definitely ordering the foie gras and the duck here.),(I have been fortunate to dine in many places all over the world. So for me to say that Lumiere is in my top 5 is saying a lot. It also is a very unlikely location (a small strip mall) for such a fine dining experience. But do not let that fool you - this is excellent french cuisine!

The interior is well decorated, and the service team is very friendly. We had escargot, french onion soup, and the duck confit for starters. All amazing. They also brought an amuse bouche of a soup shot and a pastry that were both great.

The entrees were fantastic! So much going on each plate, with a generous serving. I had a filet mignon served over a brioche with seared foie gras, black truffles, asparagus, and mush rooms. Simply divine. My girlfriend had a pork chop, with chorizo pork sausage, french beans, and something else I forget - also amazing.

And dessert was great too - black cherry creme brulee with lemon sorbet and flourless chocolate torte with brown butter gelato with marshmellow glaze. From start to finish, an excellent dinner in what I would consider a ""hole-in-the-wall"" location. If I lived in Charlotte, I would be eating here regularly.)"

From this great perch, you can sit and watch the city of Charlotte walk by. Strongly recommended on a game day when the silver blue and black are practically a parade!

Coffee is standard Starbucks - slightly overdone and slightly overpriced. There are also coolers of pastries and cold drinks.

While they do have wi-fi, I did not spot any power outlets. The bathroom needed a tidy and restock, but I suppose that's normal for an urban location.),(While I wish Uptown would bring in more local coffee and tea shops, this Starbucks has a lock on the city due to its location and street facing facade. 

Like Stephen K, I won't bore you with my favorite drinks or snackies at the 'Bucks but here are the relevant nuggets of knowledge:

1) This Starbucks is right across the street from the Bank of America building (cha-ching)...granted, within walking distance you can find a few other local spots to grab some brew, but folks usually see the big green sign and flock to the familiar.
2) The baristas are friendly and fast
3) While most people pick up after themselves, you'll probably find a dirty table or two since this place has so many visitors and a ton of foot traffic.
4) You won't find any parking around here...but most folks in the Charlotte area know that already.

Sure, the Jalapeño Chicken panino sounds appealing. One bite in, and I called shenanigans on the ""grilled"" poultry (brown lines looked drawn on), nearly raw bacon fat with the titillating essence of fake jalapeño spice, and a puddle of gross honey mustard on bread pressed in a lukewarm griddle. Great, now it just feels stale. How much does instant regret cost? $9.50? Sounds about right.

Did I mention the lettuce felt like paper in my mouth? I'm sorry; that sounds insensitive - I actually know a few people who eat paper, and they're fine folks. They'd never touch this sandwich.

Never again.),(Before you eat here, know that there's a Starbucks just up the way, and a Sbarro just across from it. Both are better options, kids. 

I was attracted to the idea of freshness, but that's not at all what I got. My turkey and pesto panini was salty, and although they had grilled it it was still cold. Very unappealing and gross. For an $8 sandwich, I expected a lot more. 

There are very few food options in this terminal, but believe me when I say you're better off eating at any other than Fresh Attractions.),(A bit confusing as to where to go, what to pick and where to stand in line, but when you are at an airport and hungry - it's amazing what you will go through to get a bite to eat!),(It was just after 7 a.m., I'd just arrived at Charlotte airport and wanted to grab something small before my next flight onto my final destination an hour later.

I really wanted a cheese danish from Starbucks, but as I passed the Starbucks kiosk in this concourse the line was about 30 people deep and I didn't have the patience to deal with that.  I came upon Fresh Attractions, there was only 1 person in line and whatta ya know, this place had the SAME cheese danishes as Starbucks!  Win!!

I grabbed a Danish and a bottle of milk and paid $5.50 for everything, or less than a cup of coffee alone would've cost at Starbucks. Double win!!)"

It reminded me a lot of California's Daphnes chain. Was overwhelmed by their extensive menu, and they seem to be known for their burger in a pita (forgot what it's called).

Very quick in service, and I had 2 boxes to take with me to go! Tons of gyro meat, but it was a bit dry. Their pita is really good, I think they fry it, giving it that extra yumminess. I ended up making my own gyro with the veggies from the salad. Their fries were the crinkle cut kind, and it was good, but way too much! I couldn't even eat half my meal!

They have the special ice, which they put a ton of, which means getting a refill when you pick up your food! Staff are all very friendly and courteous as well.

Homemade gnocchi, kids. Yes indeedy, little potato made nuggets of love can be found here on Tuesdays. Why Tuesdays only? Well, gnocchi is pretty time consuming to create, so that's the day they offer it at Dolce. And it is deeeelightful. 

I've been here twice, but finally remembered to hit up Dolce on a Tuesday for some delectable gnocchi. Since it was being delivered from Foodie Call, I had to make the difficult of decision of type of sauce, all of my own. I had no waiter to guide me...do I choose pesto? Or fresh tomato? Or four cheese? How about bolognese? Or maybe butter sage?! *head explodes*

Well, I went with the four cheese because I was at home and I was already sportin' my sweatpants. But I also requested a side of fresh tomato sauce too, just to have some variety available. Holy yum. These little nuggets of joy are superbly made, cooked just a bit al dente and bathing in just enough sauce...it'll make you say mmmmmmmmm. I  enjoyed the four cheese, but it was a bit heavy for me. The fresh tomato was a really nice alternative and I'm glad I ordered it. 

What else did I order on this chunkerific night in for myself? Tiramisu, of course. I had to try it - and Dolce makes it well. Tasty layers of sweet ricotta mixed in with layers of rum and espresso soaked lady fingers. Well done, Dolce. It's not the best tiramisu I've had, but it's certainly solid. Nom.

1.Any store that's retail pricing instead of four times restaurant mark up, makes me happy.  

2. Community farm table, where you can socialize with Not Just Coffee patrons too!

3. Knowledgeable, unassuming staff, you can be a total novice or an oenophile and you feel welcomed.

Yes, I know I'm from Nebraska, but I think I've been in the South for too long now and lost my thick skin for chilly temps. Thanks to Yelp, I found this little old school deli and Charlotte gem tucked away in a strip mall on Independence. 

The front of the menu has the tagline- you get your money's worth. That's all you need to know. End of review. I popped into Chris' at 8:30pm on a Monday. I was greeted warmly by one of the waitresses. Then it was decision time: vegetable, chicken noodle, or chicken and rice soup. I went chicken and rice. It was the perfect warm bowl of soup that I needed on a cold night. I also got a turkey reuben. So good. Note: they do their reubens with mustard. If you want thousand island, just make sure to ask. Soup, reuben, macaroni salad... all for about $10. I actually saved half my sandwich and side for lunch the next day. Two perfect Nikki-sized meals. 

Chris himself was in the kitchen. He made my meal for me. He also took the time to come out, talk to me, and tell me about the place. (I walked in around closing time, so I was the only person there at the time) Such a sweet man. He even sent me home with a bag of apples. Why? Because he said they were so delicious. 

I live in Elizabeth, so my GPS took me through a neighborhood on the backside of the strip mall. I didn't have to touch Independence at all. Just a heads up, in case you think your GPS is drunk. 

Signs of a solid spot? The construction and bat ish craziness of Independence Blvd couldn't even slow down this place. It has a ton of regulars who pop in for lunch every week.

This place rocks when it comes to consistency I frequent here often for lunch..you can always get a seat and the waiters are friendly.

Prices are okay ($5 for a local draft is quite reasonable) and there were enough seats around the dinner hour.

After seeing multiple delicious pizzas make their rounds throughout the market to tables seated with happily expectant guests, the time was nigh.

Hanging out on a Saturday morning at the market is great. Tons of hustle and bustle. Hungry folks exploring the various vendors and stands. We enjoyed the morning crowd and had an early lunch. 

My wife ordered the mushroom on the sprouted ancient grain crust and I ordered the chorizo pie on the traditional white crust. The mushroom had incredible, robust aromatics. Local shitaki mushrooms and a nice whisper of truffle. The crust is thin and chewy with tons of grainy flavor. That subtle truffle oil flavor....heaven. The chorizo was great. I appreciated the lime wedge to squeeze over the pie. It added the needed sourness to enhance the other savory flavors. I enjoyed chorizo, but the mushroom definitely took first prize of the two. Easily one of the best craft pizzas I've had in the QC.

They also have some great drink choices. Ting? I haven't seen this except at Jamaican restaurants and ethnic markets! How cool! I LOVE Ting. I used to drink it as a kid. It's a nice, perky flavor and works well with the pizza. 

Price point is very fair for the craft they churn out, they bring the pizza to you where ever you are in the market, and you can even custom your pie to the world's end. I'm so stoked this place set up in the 7th Street Market!

Very much looking forward to going back. Cheers!),(Everyone was telling me this pizza was delicious!!  I just wasn't paying attention, I went yesterday for a job, it was our fourth stop and we had been eating all day.

We tried The Chorizo, it was so unique.  It was like a street taco, thin crust topped with cheese, chorizo, cilantro, tomato, raw red onion and a little radish.. it was an explosion of flavor.  Just the perfect mix of hot food, with crisp toppings and tiny amount of spice. Well balanced, you just wanting to keep eating it, to keep getting the wave of flavors.

Local sourced ingredients, friendly service + delicious product. And did I mention beer? They have a five or six local beers on tap.  Good times.

Check times in the evening because it closes when the Market closes.),(I guess I'm in the minority here. To me, the pizza tastes like a glorified version of Domino's. There is definitely a similarity in taste between the two. 

If you're looking for New York pizza (real NY pizza, not the places that call themselves ""NY Pizza""), then you will probably be disappointed. If you're not a pizza snob (as in from NY), then you should be good to go. 

It's also a little on the expensive side in regards to value.

To set the scene, hubs and I took my parents here for a late dinner in celebration of my mom's birthday. 

The Good: The herb butter for our delicious bread, the amazing and extensive wine selection (especially wine by the glass), the lovely interior (it's an old church renovated into a restaurant).

The Meh: While my mom loved her scallop dish (I ordered the same), I thought it was just ok. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the sweet potato puree was entirely too sweet for my liking and the dish lacked texture. I also tried some of hubs' peach souffle and I didn't taste much peach, only eggy souffle. For the record, I'm not a huge souffle fan, so take that for what it's worth. 

The Service: This gets a category of its own. It's traditional paced\/slower service which can be just fine. Our server was very polite and friendly and provided some great suggestions in terms of wine and entrees. However, he became a bit absent nearing the end. Yes, we started dinner a bit late at 9 pm, but I expect that great service to continue through the end of my meal. He must have misunderstood us, as the gentlemen at the table pre-ordered their souffles but my mother and I would have liked to order our own desserts. By the time the souffles (and our serve) returned to our table we honestly didn't want to wait to order another round of treats. He also didn't offer us any coffee to finish off our meal. Yes, all these things I could have gotten up from the table and fetched him, but I wasn't in the mood to chase. 

So, Bonterra, for me, is just ok. I wasn't blown away by the food or the service but I wasn't super disappointed either.),(Elegant old Church. Beautiful details.

Restaurant week again in Charlotte and have wanted to try Bonterra for some time.  Made reservations and drove down tonight to give them a try.

It's in an old Church in Dilworth and they have preserved many of the original features.  While dining is Elegant, attire is somewhat more relaxed.  

This place has some of the best wait staff I have experienced in the Charlotte metro area.  These are not kids making a few extra bucks or working their way though college.  The servers are older and professionals in theri craft.

Restaurant is the Pre Fixe arrangement where you get three courses for a set rate of $30.  Bonterra like most places allow you to upgrade your entree for a nominal charge.  In my wife's case, she upgraded her hanger steak to a 8 oz fillet for an additional $12 which was still very reasonable.

We both started with salads. She had the Kale Salad and I had the Baby Arugula. From the description it sounded very similiar to a salad I had had a Delmonico's at the Venetian in Las Vegas a number of years ago and it was indeed, very close.

She had her fillet and I have the Pork Tenderloin with Peach Sauce.  Cooked to perfection, nice and moist and full of flavor.

For dessert, we both had fruit and cheese trays which were a perfect compliment to an otherwise perfect evening.

We ill be back and probably will not wait for Restaurant Week to provide and excuse.)"

You see, I love Thai food and I've heard really wonderful things about this spot. Finally when I had a meeting in University I jumped at the chance to grab some lunch here. 

The Good: The service was incredible fast (scary fast), efficient and friendly. Water glasses were kept full and I felt welcomed at all times. The restaurant, albeit a bit dark, was quite clean and definitely crowded for the lunch rush (always a good sign). Prices were affordable and spot on for the Thai fare offered. 

The Meh: My Pad See Ew was just ok. It had a nice spice to it (I asked for spice level three) but it was lacking in noodles. And it's a noodle dish. Maybe I just got the runt of the pad see ew litter, but there was twice as much chicken as noodles. Taste wise it was fine but nothing to really write home about. 

As for the gratis sweet & sour soup that comes at the beginning of the meal - frankly I'm never a fan of that soup in general, so it's not so fair to judge it here. 

Overall it was a fine meal, but I'm not rushing back to Thai House. If I find myself hankering for pad thai or curry while rolling around University, I'd definitely give it another go.),(08\/20\/11

Still enjoying the carved woodwork.  Was still full from BBQ lunch, so I only ordered the fried tofu salad, while sisters and BIL split a couple of delicious-looking entrees.  I really enjoyed my salad-- the peanut salad dressing was almost addicting!

The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that true NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the true experience.

The non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready. Overall I still think Fuel is the place to go if you want some REAL pizza, and I don't think Charlotte has anything to knock it off the throne just yet.)"
KEGLWeFAWXvo0W2LnujhtQ,"Vietnamese, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.23669,-80.7745024,Lang Van Vietnamese,345,4.5,"(One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Given the location (Shamrock and Eastway), it would be easy to completely bypass or disregard this place. But in my opinion, it's one of the Queen City's gems.

I usually get my order to go, but it's always a real treat when I do get to eat there. The staff is friendly. The service is top notch. Don't know what you want? Tell your server what you like. He\/she will help you order. If you're even a semi regular, they remember what you want... even down to the beverage. And I can promise you that your drink will never go empty. Someone is always there ready to fill your glass... sometimes after your first sip!

I love pho, or as I call it comfort in a bowl. My standard order is Pho Bo Vien (rice noodle soup with meatballs), spring rolls, and fresh summer rolls. Now you see why I often opt to pick it up... so no one can judge me on the amount of food I consume.

Lang Van is great place for those engaged in a mad, passionate love affair with Vietnamese food and also for the newbies. If you're a little weary about giving Vietnamese a try... don't be!),(How in the ever-loving, joyous world of immeasurably delectable Vietnamese cuisine have I not reviewed Lang Van until this day?!?! Upon my visit last night, I was astonished at my lack of review. Well, as they say, better late than never.

I've been a patron of Lang Van for years and have never had an experience where the food, service, and company have not been unique, memorable and utterly satisfying. The owner(?) or manager is one of the friendliest people in all of the Queen City. Regardless if you visited this week, late 2012, or even 5 years ago, she'll remember your face. She'll come up to you and give you a hug, welcome you, ask how your family is, and then hastily launch into bringing you a menagerie of Vietnamese foodstuffs. 

The menu, which is not for the faint of heart, houses an abundance of options. I used to order anything with coconut curry or just the simple Pho, but the owner (I really need to remember her name!) simply asks me what I'm in the mood for, proceeds to list options -- ""What do you like? What do you want? Do you like crispy tofu? Do you like noodles? Coconut Curry? Vegetables? Meat or no meat?.....Ok, I'll bring you something nice."" --------- THAT is why Lang Van is an incredible experience every single time. Not even seeing a menu anymore is a dream come true. 

Recently, I was introduced to Vietnamese coffee. Check out my photo or some of the others. It's an experience to be had. Condensed milk, a small urn of drip coffee...strong coffee above a tall glass with ice. Truly amazing. 

Lang Van is a staple in Charlotte's Vietnamese dining scene...nay. Overall. If you're even close to the line of wanting to try Vietnamese cuisine, start here.),(Even if you don't know what vietnamese food is you have to try Lang Van.  I have been here quite a few times but not in a while and I'm so glad I came back.  I've actually never ordered off the menu until the other night, normally I just tell the friendly waitress what I like and she brings me back something delicious.   I highly recommend the lemongrass curry and steamed shrimp spring rolls delicious.  This restaurant is at the top of my list.  This place is also great if your looking for a quick dinner they can have you in and out in 30 minutes.),(06\/20\/10

(Not so) fresh in Charlotte (we took the red-eye flight in), Mom and I were driven here by my sister and her son straight from the airport for some good Vietnamese fare.  She's been here before with coworkers, so she knew we'd enjoy the food (I turned her onto Thai green curry, and she knew Mom liked pho).  As we got out of the car, she said that this place was a hole-in-the-wall (the outside certainly screamed of it), but I'd already come across reviews from Charlotte yelpers, so I knew the food was, at the very least, decent.  I told her it wasn't me she should be apologizing to about the dive-y aspect of LV, but I digress...

Well!  Whatever LV lacks in looks outdoors, it certainly made up for indoors-- this place doesn't look like a dive at all!  It's actually pretty cozy indoors, with warm paint hues, wall accents, and floral decor.  Staff seemed friendly enough, with sincere smiles and perky greetings at the ready.  That is, up until I started taking photos* of my durian shake.  Duri-what, you say?  But I'm getting ahead of myself...

We started off with glasses of water all around and a durian shake.  Well, first I asked what our server would recommend- the soursop or the durian shake?  She said she liked the flavor and consistency of the durian, but that I should really go for the avocado.  Now, we're from the Philippines, so we all know about soursop, durian, and avocado, so I get what she was trying to tell me.  Unfortunately, I have an avocado allergy, so that's a no-go.  (Why, oh why can't I be allergic to a food I hate??)  So, I went w\/ the stinky durian.

If you've ever come across durian, you know it's not a scent you'd readily reach a bottle of and spray on yourself willingly (you might as well reach for a skunk), but many food addicts will agree with me, it makes for a mighty tasty and creamy beverage!  OMG, how I wanted to order another one, and I wasn't even finished with the first!  Our mom agreed with me; my sister didn't.  Sadly, bec. her son heard of his mom's aversion, he wasn't willing to give it a go.  Oh, well.  More for us!

Our server came back and took the rest of our order: fresh summer rolls app (goi cuon) for Mom and sis; eggrolls (chia gio) and a chicken skewer on vermicelli for the little one; a stir-fried shrimp with steamed veggies for Mom; a chicken curry with stewed sweet potato chunks for sis; and beef lemongrass curry for me.  All rolls came wrapped with rice paper; non-noodle dishes came with rice, with the exception of my selection, which came over shredded lettuce, sauteed onions, crisp alfalfa sprouts, and chopped parsley.  

Nephew loved the eggrolls!  So much so, he didn't even touch his chicken skewer and noodles.  Mom and sis enjoyed the shrimp dish, but eschewed the chicken and sweet potato curry, stating that the chicken ""fingers"" were dry and flavorless.  (Indeed, they looked like pieces that normally are subject to the blanch and shock methods of cooking to be later used in stir-fried and curry-fried dishes.)  Mom, sis, and I agreed, however, that the stewed sweet potato chunks were delicious; the one-note sweet flavor in this curry dish came from the sweet potato.  I think the dish would've been better served with beef...

It was unanimous- the best dish in the entire meal was the beef lemongrass curry!  I was tempted to order medium-spice, but I wanted Mom to enjoy it, as well, so I chose mild, and were we all glad that I did!  Perfectly spiced (apparently, Viet-mild is hotter than Thai-mild), the beef was very flavorful, salted just so, and was oh-so-tender that it almost melted in your mouth, yet had enough of a chew to it that you knew you were having stir-fried meat.  Y'know what I'm sayin'?  Oh, forget what I'm trying to say and just order a plate and taste what I mean for yourself!    

With such a spread, we didn't order any desserts- the shake was decadent enough.  However, the bill arrived with a few of those tamarind-flavored candy, as well as these ab-fab mini peanut-cookie morsels!  I am now on a quest to hunt a bag (or two, or three!) of these to take back home!  No, they're not made in-house, so perhaps someone can tell me where I can find some?

*Try to keep the photos to a minimum.  All of the smiles from other servers disappeared once I started taking photos of the shake, and later, the food.  Our server kept up with the smiles, though.),(Lang Van is a little overpriced and overrated.  Sure, the food is good, but it is Americanized Vietnamese and I guess it shows since the clientele are mostly American.  We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy.  So busy that we got the last remaining open table.  We ordered fried spring rolls and two bowls of pho dac biet.  Whenever I get pho, I always order the dac biet since it includes everything.  The dac biet here was seriously lacking in ingredients and portion size.  I finished my bowl in no time and I did not leave full.  This is the first time a bowl of pho did not fill me up.  Not only that, but one bowl is $8.95!  (Bowls at most other pho shops start at $2-3 less.)

Maybe I'm just used to all the Vietnamese pho shops up and down Buford Highway in Atlanta, but the pho here was kind of a joke.  There were much less noodles and no tripe in the soup.  Also, instead of giving us limes to eat with the pho, they gave us *lemons* - another first.  Anyhow, while the food itself is good, the portions are lacking and the prices are jacked up.  I'm sure there are better, more authentic Viet places in Charlotte.)"

Though I love Malaysian cuisine for it's mix of great curry dishes and noodles, I went with sushi here. Not exactly sure why, but I was rather satisfied with the selection. 

We started with the roti telur which is one of our favorite Malaysian dishes. Theirs was a little more spicy than others we've had, and the curry was housed the typical potatoes swimming in a delicious curry sauce. The pancake was great and cut into larger pieces than usual. As always, eating this with chopsticks is the way to go!

I ended up ordering a specialty sushi roll -- spicy tuna, avocado on top, a spicy mayo, and veggies. It was pretty standard and exactly what I expected. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was filling, but we all know the problem with sushi....Give yourself 30 minutes and you're hungry again! Blast! I should have ordered more to go! Service was a little sluggish and our food was brought out in oddly spaced waves. Not a deal-breaker, but it was a little inconvenient. 

I can't wait to go back and try one of the chef's specialties. I love the feel of this place as it is rather open with plenty of seating. 

A drawback is the odd placement and parking. There are like....4 entrances and only one of them is unlocked\/functional as an entrance. Kind of weird, but who cares. Very much looking forward to my next visit.),(Yummy - again just one of those places i've driven by a thousand times.. just took some good yelp reviews to get me to stop on in.  
Let's start with the service - superb our waiter Ian knows everything and anything on the menu...I highly recommend you listen to his suggestions.
Ian brought us a taste of the curry which was good - it wasn't quite Thai but also wasn't quite Indian it was a nice mix.  Then he brought me every type of noodle in house so I could pick a noodle dish.

The menu here is huge and it can be hard to make a decision - so try a little bit of everything like I did.  Did I mention they also serve sushi and it's awesome.  I'm glad I finally gave this place a try...I'll be stopping by quite a bit.)"

Of the bars we hit during the Crawl, this was my favorite.),(Is it weird I like to order pizza at an Irish pub? 

I love Tyber Creek. I don't even live in South End, but I find myself here a lot. The one consistent theme: I always have a good time.. day drinking, after work cocktails, a place to kick off the evening or to end a blurry night.

What can you expect? The place is dark. The patio is pretty spectacular. The bartenders know how to pour a Guinness correctly. I don't drink the stuff (unless it's in the form of a car bomb), but I give them props for doing it right. It's insane here for St. Patrick's Day. Tyberpalooza is super fun. What is that? An annual two day event that happens every CIAA weekend. Live music, flip cup and cornhole tourneys. They bring in a big ass heated tent for it.

Typically, we come here just to drink. When I do need to order food, I usually go with pizza. I like the Tyber Old School. Buffalo sauce, grilled chicken, ranch = a trio that I will always enjoy. They do brunch on Sundays with a bloody mary bar. 

I've left my car here several times overnight and it has been fine when I come pick it up the next day. Take that for what it's worth. If you drink, don't drive. Check points are no stranger to South Blvd, especially near 277 and uptown.),(Yeah I like this bar, the bartenders are awesome and they make good drinks.

Bonus points for great daily drink specials! 

As for the eats, the menu also received a fairly nice redo as well! I was particularly fond of the pesto dip to go along with the fresh and toasty pita triangles.

I've seen comments about folks that go here as ""wannabe social climbers,"" but if those folks are going here to social climb, then they've already missed the first rung.....so-to-speak.

So when I was in the area on my own, I popped in for lunch.

Nice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that's to be expected.

The mac & cheese was excellent. I'm not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that's also to be expected.

Service was good, the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable.

Looking forward to returning with a meat eater.),(Perhaps it was my high expectations for Block and Grinder, but the food and atmosphere was just not all that for my friends and I.  I made a reservation earlier in that day for a table for 3 and when we got there, I didn't see my name in their book... but there was literally nobody else in the restaurant so it's not like we needed one anyways (on a Tuesday evening).

The atmosphere here was severely lacking - maybe it was the boring, chain restaurant-like decor and furniture, the weird lighting, or the fact that it was completely empty for most of the night except for our table.  Service was okay... nothing to call home about and they could definitely use some smiling.

The food came out fairly quickly after we ordered.  We ordered the special 18 oz prime rib eye of the night (not knowing it was $55, of course) and it was definitely cooked medium rare, but was a little on the cold side for me.  The meat was really hard to cut with the steak knife they provided me with for some reason - was having some real struggles there.  However, for $55, I have definitely had better rib eye else where, like Del Frisco's.  

In addition to the steak, we ordered a trio of charcuterie and a trio of sides.  The charcuterie wasn't specactular - the spicy chorizo and wild boar sopressata you could most definitely find at your local Whole Foods at $8-9 for an entire sausage rather than the few pieces you get here.  The mustard and crostini was good.  The drunken goat cheese I've had elsewhere was much better.  

As for the sides - the mac and cheese was the best dish of the night probably, but was very runny.  The grits were probably the worst dish of the night, as they had absolutely no flavor or seasoning whatsoever and seemed undercooked.  We had to add a ton of salt because it was so, so bland.  The sweet potato puree was pretty standard.

We also ordered the pork belly dish to start.  While it was beautifully glazed\/caramelized on the outside, I have never in my life had such chewy, jaw-breaking pork belly in my life.  It had good flavor, but I'm just unsure as to how it was cooked because it literally made my jaw sore to chew through.  It was basically like rubber.

I'm not sure if this was just a terribly off night because nobody else was eating and if the food was stale because of that or what, but our experience definitely was not on par with the raving reviews on Yelp.  Everything was also overpriced, in my opinion.  Over $100 for not that much food.  Definitely better dining options in Charlotte after our experience here.)"

What to get: The Pineapple Special Drink they recommend
What else: If your Mac computer tells you it's 3.14, that's Pi on Apple.

I don't want to cause Con Fusion, but I have to say that despite all my semi positive Bubble Tea reviews in North Carolina, that NC doesn't really have good bubble tea. Not compared to what I am used to.

However Tea Fusion is as close as it gets. The decor is wonderful, the girls serving here are extremely friendly, happy, and if they were single you'd want to date them. I don't actually know if they're single, I'm just trying to put you off from trying to date them in case they actually are.

I ended up ordering 3 drinks here (typical me) because they kept recommending different things. It was easily my most fun experience in Charlotte, although I'll be in town again tomorrow so maybe I'll find something even more fun. So to speak.

The regular milk tea and other milk teas are good, but the Pineapple special drink that they rave about (with all the crazy bits in it) is by far the star of the show. It's a little sweet, but I enjoyed it and it refreshed me like a wet kipper to the face back in old bonnie wee Scotland me lassie.

Aye.),(I stopped in my tracks, staring at the large sign in front of me, shining like a giant beacon, beckoning me to come closer.

I couldn't believe it.

Is it real? Do my eyes deceive me? IS THAT BOBA? In North Carolina??? 

Without a second to waste, I dragged my coworker like a rag doll inside the brightly lit parlor that was decorated with velvet couches, plushy chairs, twinkling lights, and large, decorative lamps hanging from above. With contemporary music blasting through the sound system, it was almost as if I was back in the Bay Area on a typical boba run with my darling hubby.

The black menu showcased various fruit teas, bubble teas (smoothies), milk teas, and hot drinks. My eyes, however, instantly locked on the milk tea section, spotting my favorite, green milk tea. I eagerly ordered that with grass jelly while my coworker got a strawberry bubble tea with pearls. 

But my eagerness faltered just a bit when I caught a glance of my boba that was...green?

I don't remember green milk tea being green (ironic, now that I think about it). I hesitantly popped the lid and took a small sip before the familiar taste of matcha hit my tongue. While I understand why this would be called green milk tea, I can't say that I didn't feel somewhat tricked...It wasn't the drink I was expecting at all.

That's not to say I'm not a fan of matcha. I most certainly do like the flavor, but Tea Fusion Cafe made the drink a bit too powdery. I didn't like the chalky aftertaste hanging around on my tongue. However, I did like how they used crushed ice and that the grass jelly was silky, even though the pieces all floated to the top.

I was alarmed that in terms of prices, Tea Fusion Cafe closely matched those in the Bay Area. I thought California was always going to be more expensive when compared to North Carolina, but clearly that isn't always the case. Perhaps the lack of demand raises the price?

When it comes to boba, though, I don't think there are a lot of states that can compete with the plethora of choices in California, but to see that Charlotte had at least one was a pleasant surprise. It may not have been perfect, but it was good enough for me to finish the cup with a smile.)"

Normally it's the same routine for me... when I have a short layover I come in and go out. When it's a little longer, I normally have a beer and some sushi out in the open area at Hissho Sushi. This particular time I had a 2 hour layover for a early morning flight, and had to catch my plane down in the A terminal...a place that I had never been before.

As I wandered down this particular terminal, I noticed that there was little down there. It was a smaller area with a lot less to offer. The biggest place that I saw was the Uptown Bar & Lounge. They had multiple large screen televisions and a huge bar, so I decided to wait out my 2 hours here. 

They had a full bar and were also offering a small breakfast menu. I decided to go that route and ordered a egg and cheese sandwich on wheat along with grits, a mimosa, and a cup of coffee.

The coffee was pretty decent. It wasn't as strong as I like, but at the same time it wasn't watery like a lot of other places. The mimosa wasn't anything special. I just watched the bartender pour some juice in some champagne. I eventually got my meal, which is served on a plastic plate along with plastic ware. The egg sandwich was something that I normally make when I'm in a rush and half awake in the mornings. Nothing special at all...actually a little below average. The plastic bowl of grits had a few lumps and no flavor at all.

The bartender was nice, not anything overwhelming, but she was nice, and polite, and gave me what I ordered. You can't ask for more than that.

If you have a flight out of A, this is a decent spot to grab a drink and watch some TV. Unless you have a flight leaving out of A, there's no reason to venture down that way. Uptown Bar & Lounge doesn't really deserve the ride down the moving sidewalk.),(Great customer service, but food was just average.  Can't expect much from an airport restaurant, but it was food in the belly before a long flight home.  

The trend I saw at all the dining establishments I went to in the south were... friendly, southern hospitality service from waiters and staff and bitching and rude customers.  Apparently the people who sat down before we did at the same table were total jerks.  I guess what they say is true about the south... ""there's nothing like it"".)"

And yep, she loved it. So much so that she now wants to go back to Paco's almost immediately.

Service was very good - we let Shauna pick our tacos for us, as long as there was at least one fish taco on each plate. Good move! She asked some questions about our preferences for spiciness and allergies and got it taken care of.

Yep, we'll go back!),(Jalapeno margarita + kick ass salsa = one happy Nikki.

I have always loved the food here, but the service has pushed this from 4 stars to 5 stars.

Let's begin with research I did a few weeks ago for the Weekly Yelp. For my Yelp Flips The Bird issue, I called on a super busy night. The nice young girl on the phone answered all my odd questions (I never told her who I was or why I was asking all these questions). So nice... so helpful. 

This past weekend, I took my buddy Steve to bust his Paco's Tacos cherry. The bartender was our server. She was fantastic. Super friendly, so good at her job. She knew the menu by heart. And when she got tied up with to-go orders at the bar, another nice girl jumped right in to bring us boxes and the check. During the meal, the manager walked over to ask how our lunch was. I wish all restaurants did this. It's such a simple gesture, but it really does go a long way.

Okay now to the food!

Chips and salsa: I love the salsa here. Perfect combination of spice and flavor... plus the chips are so light and fresh. I could easily crush multiple orders by myself.

Firestarter margarita: Jalapeño infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had. 

Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high. 

Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.

Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side. 

Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals. 

I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit. 

Cheers Paco's! :)),(I was very excited to try out another of Frank Scibelli's concepts. I've been a longterm fan of Bad Daddy's and Midwood Smokehouse. I had heard good things about the tortillas and their specials. Glad we finally got this concept in the books! 

Tucked behind the Williams Sonoma on Morrison, it's a secluded location that comes alive for a BIG dinner crowd. Plenty of parking in the lot and other lots surrounding the shopping center. 

Our visit was for dinner recently. We had tried other nights but the way can be rather overwhelming. We made it in for an 8pm dinner. 

Service was great. Seated quickly, given a good rundown of the menu and recommended a few margaritas for us to try. We obliged and tried the original marg and a mango-infused marg. Sad to say, I was rather unimpressed with the mix. I'm not much of a margaritas goer, but the balance was wrong and seemed to be thrown together rather fast without much consideration for taste. I was a little disappointed since it was a bit of a slower night in the dining room(s) and the bar. On to the meal...

Chips are great. Light, lightly salted and served with an array of salsas. The standard red salsa has a twinge of heat and an smoke to the flavor. The tomatillo is freaking great. Uhh...I think I put it on everything but my margarita. Definitely worth the tomatillo alone. 

Entrees: My wife, as many know, is a vegetarian. The menu actually reads ""Ask about our vegetarian options."" Sadly, there aren't actual ""options."" Our server pointed to a few regular items that can be made sans meat. She ordered the Gringo Nachos. The only options listed on the menu are chicken, ground beef or brisket. Her order only came with the standard veggies. Rather underwhelming and definitely screaming for some more cheese. 

I ordered the standard Paco's Tacos. An order of two that comes with rice and beans. The rice was pretty standard and a welcome accompaniment to my tacos. The beans, however, are a ""charro"" style recipe. Can't say that I'm a fan. Very burnt flavor and lacking in welcoming texture. With a generous helping of the tomatillo salsa, they were in the clear! The tacos were GREAT. Love the tortillas. Made in-house, and boy does it show. Warm, chewy and perfect floury taste. I could 5 with just the tomatillo salsa. The brisket is worth a try. Never had it on tacos before, but I would definitely order it again. Seasoned well and paired nicely with the other taco accouterment. 

Price is rather fair. No complaints in that department. 

I'd say there are a few things that could have been done a bit better, but we'll definitely be back to try some other options. Looking forward to those warm tortillas again soon! Thanks, Frank Scibelli for another option in the Queen City!),(Ah Paco's, I was really excited to try your tequila soaked spot. Too bad I came for lunch and didn't get a chance to indulge in a big mamma jamma margarita, but that's for next time. Onto my lunch experience...

I met a great business contact here and we enjoyed a tasty lunch. What we did not enjoy was great service - something I have come to expect from a Frank Scibelli restaurant. No, no one was outright rude or mean, our server was just kind of a dud of sorts. I don't know if he was having a bad day or just needs more training but it wasn't great. 

First, the food...
I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas and they were tasty. They were topped with a creamy queso and a bit of sour cream mixture. The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the two enchiladas. The refried beans were standard as was the rice. My only gripe? I wish it had a little more spice - in all components. The flavor of the chicken and the dish as a whole would be much elevated with a little kick. 

The service...sorry for the long, drawn out info...
Our server was just kind of absent - he wasn't engaging, didn't help much with recommendations and he also forgot a few things that my dining companion asked for on the side, one being chopped jalapenos. When my dining companion asked for fresh, chopped jalapenos on the side our server looked at her and blankly said, ""I don't think we have any fresh jalapenos."" Really, that's odd...we both thought. Then she said, well I'd appreciate any jalapenos please. Once our food came out, no jalapenos. So we politely asked the runner for the same request, and fresh chopped jalapenos came out in seconds. Ok....

And then the bill. So, it was my fault for not digging into the bill pad, but our sever did indeed give me the bill as I requested, on one check. There was a bit of confusion as I requested a copy of the full bill, and I didn't see one in the check pad, etc. Regardless, it was in there and that's my fault for not digging, but after the manager brought me a copy of the bill and reconciled (my) error the server said, ""You need to tell my manager it's ok, because otherwise you're going to get me in trouble."" Hmm. Nice. I happily told the manager there was not problem and it was my misunderstanding, I was chatting with my business contact, didn't notice, etc. I apologized but I thought it was pretty rude for the server to go there, if you know what I mean.

So, long story short, the food was good and I definitely want to come back and give it another go but I hope that server's having a better day and if not, I hope I'm seated in another section.),(Hmm...I really believe this is a 4+ star place, but not everyone is sharing my love for Pacos.

I was graciously invited to check out the place a while back and glad I did. The funny thing is I thought Manzetti's was still at that location?

I bumped into some folks from work, so this place is popular and even met a local micro-brewer from the Coast having some of his beers being tried out at the place that evening so a good time was had by all.

Tucked away near South Park Mall, Pacos is a great little place with some awesome selection of tequila, great guacamole, and a menu that I look forward to trying throughout 2011.

There are specials, but so far I've just ordered off the menu.  The bar is long and the table plenty, plus in the warmer months there is a patio...for which I don't think Charlotte has nearly enough of them.

Texas BBQ is good...and I also like Mexican, but Pacos is the best Tex Mex in these parts hands down.),(So we made reservations and when we got there, the line was out the door. We waited for a few minutes at the front door. It was very uncomfortable as it was humid and there was a stench coming from somewhere? They brought us around to the back side in front of the window. That was great. But it was evident that we weren't going to get served anytime soon. Our waitress went to every table around us, including a couple that was seated 5 minutes after us???? I was calm as I wanted to have a nice evening. But I really wanted to get up and leave after 15 minutes! When her mood ring changed the right color for her to serve our table, I ordered a strawberry rita on the rocks. Way to sweet. Move on to the Dennis enchiladas. Those made everything better. They had a creamy cheese sauce on top, instead of a lump of hard melted plastic. Very good and filing. The service picked up as the evening wore on, but the place was empting out as well. this would have been a four star review, but....)"

And how about the food? Well, it's pricier than other old school grilles - to the tune of $15+ for two 1\/3 lb. burger combos and a corn dog. This wouldn't really bother me much if the food was better. The burger was fine - passable, but very well done (as in quite brown) and essentially flavorless. Onion rings were clunk-ily breaded and with little flavor and fries were ""meh"" overall. I was looking for the salty little slivers of love with some crisp! 

Service wasn't super inviting and the cash register attendant didn't even hint at a smile when we ordered. As soon as cash was in hand, she went back to her computer - adjacent to the counter. With a sanitation score barely above 90 and the flavorless eats, I have indeed experienced some better burger joints in the QC.)"

I chose the number 10, which is a burrito and an enchilada, served with rice and chips. It didn't take long until my order was called out and I was able to dig in. A very good portion and very tasty.

The food- cheap and absolutely delicious. Don't believe me? Don't believe Yelp? Well, go drive by this place during lunch. There is always a line out the door. Don't worry, it moves fairly quickly. 

It's not fancy. Your food comes out in a styrofoam to-go container with the lid cut off. It comes with a little bag of chips and salsa. Make sure to also ask for the green salsa. So good. I always have to get queso as well. I love the ground beef here. I will usually get something that involves a beef burrito (like the #4 which also includes a taco and rice). My last trip I decided on tacos- one chicken, one carne asada, one carnita. All three were really good and the portion size is big. The only problem I had was that I couldn't eat all three! 

The place is small, so you might have to take your food to go. There are a few tables and a wrap around counter\/bar type. If you want to beat the rush, I recommend getting here at 11:30.),(Came to Anita's to pick up tacos for lunch.  I ordered the Carnitas and Fish Tacos.

Breakfast, burgers, Greek specialties, seafood, Italian, good 'ole home cooking- seriously, they have it all. When you walk in the door, you'll see a board of specials. Pro tip: take a pic of it before you get seated.  I don't have a go-to menu item here because I'm usually craving something different each time. The one constant is that I have to start with soup, both their vegetable and French Onion are delicious. Another big hit with our group are the apple sticks (not on the regular menu, check the specials board). Some of my other favs- pork chops, Greek combo, burgers, hot open turkey sammie (I'm a sucker for things covered in gravy).

Landmark is such a place in Charlotte.  Housed on Central Blvd., this part of town is an older and well established and is more strip mall than anything eklse with a large mixture of ethnic groups.  

The parking lot is not big enough for this eatery in addition to the 6+ business that share the space so parking is a challenge.

They are always open and you can order anything on the menu at any time.  Pricing is cheap, though it seems from a recent review by Julia S, their price on the Veggie Omelette has gone up a $1 since June as this was what I ordered.  Servers were not very engaging nor friendly and I had to ask to get my coffee cup refilled a few times, so no bonus points in that department.

All in all Landmark is a cheap eats place in a cheaper part of town.),(We went after midnight on a Friday and it was nice. 
Landmark Diner offers pretty standard diner fare. The server was friendly and the garden omelette was on the bland side but not terrible.

- Serve breakfast all day.
- Lookout for the daily specials.
- Open almost 24 hours. Check opening hours.

TJ's is always a pleasant experience. Love this location in particular since its so close to the greenway. Nice to stop in for a bottle of water or a sample of what their cooking up in the back of the store! Love that they give you free small cups of coffee, too.

The space is a great Scottish bar and pub - it's nicely put together and offers its patrons gold 'ole Scottish flair and plenty of TVs to catch a game. Hubs and I sat at the bar and grabbed a few drinks and appetizers to satiate us before our dinner next door. Ryan, our bartender, was just the nicest guy, introducing himself with a handshake and asking our names as we sat down for some feeding. All the servers that night were very, very friendly and really interested in talking to us about the new digs. Oh - and they all sport kilts. Sweet! 

Hubs and I contemplated the menu, which is filled with an incredible offering of different scotches, beers and a few different wine options. Hubs tried a few different beers and was happy he trusted Ryan with his choices. I, not the big scotch or beer drinker, went with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and was quite happy with it. 

I haven't eaten that much Scottish food in my life, so I relied on Ryan, our trusty bartender, for recommendations. We ordered the Scottish Platter and the Potato Scones. The Scottish Platter came with a handful of Guinness Fried Onion Rings, a small Meat Pie and a Scottish Egg. I wasn't thrilled with the onion rings, I thought they could have used a bit more crunch, but the meat pie and Scottish egg blew me away. If you're like me and have never indulged in either of these tasty little morsels, try them! The Meat Pie was delicate but, of course, meaty, nestled in its little pastry. The Scottish Egg - a hard boiled egg wrapped in the tiniest bit of sausage and fried was so delicious. It's definitely not something I want to consume a ton of, but it was great nonetheless. 

The Potato Scones were good as well, a lightly fried potato cake with raspberry preserves. As Ryan commented, it tastes a little bit like dessert. The potato cake was a nice consistency and I'm a fan of the sweet\/salty combo. 

Both the scones and plattter were priced fairly, $5 and $8 respectively. I hope Molly MacPherson's does well in this great Uptown location - it will be provide a nice alternative to the Irish Ri Ra (which I also enjoy)!),(The irish...they say...have he luck, but the scottish have the drink *wink*

I thought it was interesting that the waitstaff was all dressed like chefs - I don't know if that's intentional or not, but I liked it.

As for the food, well, it was excellent! The usual buffet staples like a cooked-to-order omelet station and a slicing station. But also a huge raw bar with large prawns, oysters, clams and mussels. On another table, salads and savories and sweet treats. Bacon and grits and smoked salmon and fresh sushi more!

But where the brunch stands out is the tapas menu. From your waiter\/waitress, you order delicious plates that are a perfect little bite. Egg benedict - one poached egg on a crab cake. Smoked fish tacos - a 2 inch corn tortilla filled with smoked fish with guacamole and salsa on the side. Belgian waffles. French toast. Oh, I am stuffed!

A quaint Thai resto with a lack of glitz and glam - my kind of joint. All about the food and service. You can't set your drink down without them filling it right back up! So rad. 

Food: They start you off with soup. It's some sort of rice-y, broth-y soup that has a somewhat peculiar color. Off white-ish. Very flavorful and salty. Contains some sort of protein as well. Either tofu or chicken, but not certain. 

I ordered the Pud Kee Mow. One of my favorites at any Thai place. Flat, pan seared noodles with veggies, chicken and plenty of spices. The flavor is very earthy and peppery. Huge portion for lunch, too. They give you a nice spring roll with your entree that isn't incredible, but definitely a nice touch for an already generous meal. 

Me and my buddy ate for just $18. Not too shabby, in my opinion.

And the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat!

My friend Erin and I were starving after our Yelp Quirks Out event at Jazzercise Charlotte. Time for a boozy brunch! Hey, we earned it with that workout, right? We tried to hit Sir Ed's, but they didn't open until 5pm. Fail. So, we wandered across the parking lot to Cantina 1511.

I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, so it was a no brainer for my drink order. They use a serrano and cilantro infused Finlandia vodka for this one. Win. We weren't sure what to get. Here's what I love: the waiter completely jumped in and was honest. He told me to ax my original order and gave us his ranking for the brunch dishes. Erin went with his #2 pick: the avocado bake. I went with the #3 pick: the fajita style shrimp and grits. He nailed it with both of those dishes. They were delicious. And in case you were wondering, his number one seed is the arepas benedict.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about this new location, but I like that there seems to be more parking. Yes, the shopping center area here can get crazy, but the lot can handle all of it. 

Cantina has great salsa. The tableside made guac is a must get. The tortilla soup is solid. I think I order something different every time I come here. It's all pretty good. 

This place can handle a group pretty well. I've been here for a couple different birthdays and girls night type events. They do take reservations. You can also place orders online for pickup.),(Viva Mexico! Mmmm Cantina - your guacamole never ceases to amaze me. This is a convenient place I frequent whether I need a big, tasty margarita and a few delicious appetizers or when I require a full blown Mexican fiesta.

Some of my favorites include the incredible table side guacamole - that you can request as spicy as you like, the ""street"" tacos - the pulled pork with pineapple and the fried shrimp are amazing, the Mexican chopped salad - which also comes in a smaller (more manageable) lunch sized portion and, of course, the tres leches cake.

Cantina definitely has a hold on modern Mexican cuisine - just make sure you make reservations or get there early enough to score a table. It gets especially busy on Thurs - Sat evenings. Hubs and I routinely grab a table in the bar area to avoid the wait. They also have a great patio that looks on to East Blvd.

Great food, great service - I'm a big fan of Cantina!

Oh and be careful where you park - while Cantina does have quite a sizeable parking lot, make sure you read any signage posted - the neighboring stores\/tenants will tow you if your in the wrong spot at the wrong time!),(I love Cantina 1511! 

Complimentary Chips and Salsa: Wish the chips were less hard and more light and crispy. But they give you a generous portion of chips and salsa and the salsa is good.

Guacamole: Was everything I expected and more! The habanero peppers gave it a great kick, was impressed. Awesome.

Tacos: YUM. I couldn't decide which I liked better between the Asada, Chipotle Ancho Chicken, and Pulled Pork. Asada steak and pulled pork were definitely in the top. I was a bit skeptical of the pork and pineapple combo, but they know what they're doing here at the Cantina.

Barbacoa Entree: It was really good, although a little dry. I didn't notice much of the dryness because it came with a heaping portion of avocado and the beans and rice were addictive. Top that baby off with a sprinkle of the cheese and that explains why I feel super preggers right now. It was worth it... delish.

Nutella Pie: For $5.95 this is not bad because the portion is huge, but I wasn't really a fan. It was covered in more chocolate and caramel sauce than I cared for; I guess there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Also, it was a little too mushy. 

Overall this was a great experience and the food was good - the server filled up the water quick, came to check on us frequently, and was glad to split our bill. Plus, the damage was a mere $42 between 2 people for the 3 tacos, guac, Barbacoa, and pie!),(Cantina is a great place to go drink during the day.  You know when you are trying to decide where can you go and sit outside on a beautiful day, this is that place, however, sometimes service and margaritas can be spotty.

Their chips tonight were better than usual they were lighter than my last visit, big improvment, very crispalicious. 

Our server was slack.  Anybody that says they don't like a snooty waiter, I always say, I would rather have an efficient surly waiter anyday than a nice slack ass.  It was the typical horror story of slow on giving the menus, slow on taking the orders, not giving us flatware, having to ask the food runner for flatware. I gave her cash as soon as she came around because I knew getting the check was going to take some time. 

About the margaritas, one day, there was fresh squeezed juice on the bar and the bartender made a margarita with it, I have been back a couple of times to get that same margarita, but what I get is a simple syrup almost clear margarita.  Not the same juice mixture of that day.  

I am not completly going to write off Cantina, I like their food, I am going to restrict my hours of going there from 11a-5p.  I will find that margarita again.  

About the food, I always get the same thing, one Al Pastor taco with rice and beans.),(06\/21\/10

I don't mind dining at a chain, as long as I (and others who may have joined me) leave feeling terrific about the experience.  Our party of four (three adults and a child) decided we'd try this place out, partly bec. of the glowing write-up it received in Charlotte magazine.  I was also excited about trying Mexican French toast, as written about in Charlotte magazine's ""Top 50 Breakfasts!""  

As we entered the resto, we immediately noticed the comely decor of a typical modern Tex-Mex venue, and as we sat down, I especially noted that the music was very loud.  (If you'd like to experience this yourself, first take care to find a nice quiet spot- enjoy the silence for a few seconds, if you'd like- before you turn your speaker volume to full-blast, then head over to Cantina 1511's website.  I dare you to let this go on for another 90 minutes.  I DARE YOU!)  As our server delivered our drink orders, (sis and I also asked for the margarita special of the day, which was made w\/ Heradura tequila), our server asked if we needed more time, to which I replied, ""I already know I'm having the Mexican toast,"" after which the others said they needed more time.  After the others had a few more minutes to look at the menu while listening to the loud background music, our server returned and took our orders- shrimp torta for Mom, steak fajitas for sis, and the French toast for me.  No French toast, except for Sunday brunch you say?  Well, I'll have the crab and avocado quesadilla, minus the avocado, then.  (And why the heck did you not mention this when I stated my intention before?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Maybe bec. you couldn't HEAR ME due to the crappy music that blared above us!!)

After a few minutes of trying to bat away a persistent fly, our chips and salsas arrived.  I took this time to ask the food presenter (not the server) to request if it was at all possible to lower the music's volume.  (Hey, it can't hurt to ask, right?)  The answer we received is that more than likely our request won't be granted, ""due to keeping up w\/ the atmosphere, and all.""  OK, well, would you please get rid of this pesty fly, then?""  ""Haha, sorry, but no.""  Looking back, we should've just stood up and left...

While I can't speak for the app myself due to a corn allergy, the general concensus was that it was A-OK.  The margarita, which sis at first turned her nose up to, was not bad after I stirred the beverage stick around a few times, which allowed the Heradura tequila and fresh juices to mix.  I'd asked if the drink could be made frozen, for future reference, but no.  (See a pattern here?)  As the tequila began to work its magic, sis noted that the music volume had come down a little.  Ole!  (However, the volume went back to its original strength a few minutes later.  Que mal!)

To make a ""mucho terrible"" story short, the food, w\/ the exception of the fajitas and margarita, left us w\/ much to desire.  Mom's shrimp torta was ""just another shrimp sandwich.""  ""But what about the bolillo?,"" I asked.  ""Nothing special.""  And this from a woman who LOVES the bolillos from our neighborhood grocery store!  Too bad, bec. the pics looked good, don't you agree?  (This seems like the case w\/ the cuatro leches cake, as well, but I am getting ahead of myself.)  Nephew didn't even finish his taco, nor the fries (and how he loves fries!), and my crab quesadilla dish was just three charred triangles filled w\/ too much cheese and lumps of crab here and there.  Despite my trimming off some of the cheese, I didn't even finish two!  We all pretty much concentrated on the steak fajitas, which, despite the fatty content of the meat, turned out pretty good.  (And thank goodness it did, for this pretty dish went for a pretty penny... 1600 pennies, to be exact!)  

Hoping to end the meal w\/ a postre (Spanish for dessert), I chose the Cuatro Leches cake, which promised four types of milk in the form of white chocolate meringue, dulce de leche crema (condensed and evaporated milks plus sugar) and the fourth?  I think there may have been white chocolate chunks, but don't quote me on it.  Two words: too sweet!  Take away the meringue topping, it's OK.  Nada especial!  Mom and sis didn't care for more than a bite, and bec. I didn't really have much to eat, I finished the dish anyway.  If you're going to try your luck w\/ this dolce- skip the canned peach slices and ask for more stawberries!

Or, better yet, just pass on Cantina 1511 and look elsewhere.  Not only did I end up spending $70 on a lackluster meal, but I was in a foul mood for the rest of the day due to the blaring music, not to mention the disappointment in not having the Mexican toast (French toast w\/ sweetened cream sauce).  Nowhere was it mentioned in the Charlotte magazine article, nor Cantina 1511's menu, that this selection is only available on Sundays.  

Cantina 1511 is no bueno!),(So, being so in love with both the Margaritas and guacamole this place makes I just couldn't stay away and headed back to what I consider the best place in town of both of those items.  

Drinks, food, and service were good and no issues in any of those departments.  So I'm upping the stars back to where I feel they should have been before.  Let us hope it stays that way.)"

I met a few friends here, but I was late to arrive. By the time I showed up, they had already placed their orders and the menus cleared. When i was able to flag down a waitress, I ordered a burger (someone suggested the Carolina) and the sweet potato fries. And a PBR, because it seemed appropriate.

The kitchen was able to fast track my burger so it showed up at the same time as my friends. The Carolina is seriously messy but it's loaded with fatty meaty greasy goodness. And the sweet potato fries were excellent.

We didn't stick around for long - down the road to bowl!),(Maybe it was the fact that my team (Wisconsin Badgers) was killing San Diego State...maybe it was the fact that Angry Ale's was pretty open & not filled with drunkies mid-Saturday afternoon....maybe it was the tasty sweet potato fries....or maybe it was my husband's low key company but I really liked Angry Ale's. 

I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!

I ordered the Baby Burger w\/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.

Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!),(I like this place a lot. Been here for lunch and been here at night for drinks. And I like it here.

The food is pretty good. It's bar food. But it's better bar food than a lot of places around the way. I like the burgers and wings especially.  

It's a great place to hang out and have pitchers of beer with your buddies and chill. Lots of tvs. And the patio situation rocks! 

A+++),(Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are a burger fan!
I ordered take out here and got a burger and it was absolutely delicious.

Sidenote: I'm writing this review while eating a salad. This is the definition of torture.

I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.

On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.

Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.

Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!),(For the last 18 months that I've been traveling down to Charlotte, I've been walking past this guy, dubbed ""Chili Man"" and his cart, off Tryon.  On my last week traveling down to the Queen City, my colleague and I were on our way to the usual Dean and Deluca lunch when I spotted the Chili Man and thought - dude, if I don't try the top rated Yelp ""restaurant"" before I leave this place I'm not a real Yelper.  

My colleague is vegetarian, and the Chili Man has veggie dogs and veggie chili (sometimes!).  

I got the two chili dog combo with chips and a soda for $7.75 - great bang for your buck.  I went with the Vinegar bomb and the Life Changer.  Best damn chili dogs I've had.  The vinegar bomb has some of my favorite hot dog stuffs - chili, sauerkraut, pickles, and pickled jalapenos.  Those who love your sour veggies would love this.  The Life Changer was pretty life changing indeed.  I'm a spice lover and this did not disappoint.  The addition of the ""fried cheese"" sounded weird, but made for a delicious combo.  I'd get both of these again.

I'd also like to make a note that the Chili Man is super cool.  He's a no-BS kind of guy who is very friendly and chatted it up with me and my colleague while he put his love into our food.  I like to support people like him who run small business - keep it up, Chili Man!

Forget your diet - these dogs are the real deal.),(Hot dogs are my jam, I can eat hot dogs anytime of the day, when I'm traveling, I will buy a hot dog and take a couple of bites even if I have just eaten, just for the love of hot dogs.  When I read about The Chili Man, I couldn't believe I didn't know about him! 
I once was lost but now I'm found.

Weekdays (except Monday) you can find The Chili Man's food cart parked in front of BofA and Chima on Tryon.  He is serving up delicious hot dogs with homemade chili, slaw, mustard and spicy ketchup.  

I would recommend going with someone so you can order three or four and cut them in half, so you can try different styles!!

On the outskirts of Eastland, it's not the prettiest area, but I dig the trudgery it took to experience the flavorful onslaught. 

It's purely vegetarian\/vegan. Not a whisper of meat was found in our food. 

Started with the pea\/potato samosas and garlic naan. Perfectly executed. The sauces served alongside were lovely. Spicy and pungeant. I'd order these again, but would look forward to trying another variety. The garlic naan was legendary. Chewy, charred in places, and kicked so much flavorful ass.

For entrees, we went with Chana Masala and the Paper Dosa. Masala was absolutely wonderful -- served with jasmine rice. The Paper Dosa.....just look at my photos or anyone else's. It's like a joke. So massive and hilariously served on a medium sized plate. It's a crepe-like bread with a potato mash on the base of the plate and a few dipping sauces. It's one of the most versatile Indian dishes I've experienced. the sheer size of the dish will stick with you for the rest of your life. However, the flavors are wonderful and earthy. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. 

Service was efficient, but they did seem to exude the ""you're inconveniencing me right now"" sort of attitude a few times. Not a huge deal, but it did make use the eatpayleave strategy.

Would I go back? Hell yes. Will I get Paper Dosa again? Hell yes. Am I stoked to explore the menu further? Oh....hell yes. 

Count me in as a part of the Woodlands fanclub.),(My review was written four years ago, so I thought it was time for an update.  Still solid four stars, bathrooms have been remodeled, many owner changes and currently service is a little slow, but if you know this going in and you are in a good mood you can certainly tolerate it.  We meet at 5p on the dot, order starters and a bottle of wine immediately, but if you don't know this, you might be sitting there a little while.  If you like spicy food be sure to specify because they will tone it down for you.  Especially if you are getting take away tell them HOT or they will write medium down.

Friendly service, decent parking.),(Many of you know that I'm a total treat head. Give me a cannoli, a cookie, a piece of cake, a brownie, whatever, and I'll take it down. And smile. So, it says quite a lot when I *don't* finish a treat (or at least save it for later). Let's just say the majority of my treat order went in the trash.... :(

Hubs and I stopped by Nova's for a little sugar rush around 2 pm on a Sunday. Inside, Nova's is quite sweet - a cozy little nook to the right and a wide space filled with coffee beans and a small selection of treats. After chatting with the very kind employee behind the counter we selected a cannoli dipped in chocolate and a handful of rugulach (the equivalent of pie crust rolled up with a bit of jam\/filling). 

First, the cannoli. We paid $2.90 for the dipped chocolate cannoli and it made me so, so sad. As soon as I cracked open the box and picked up the cannoli I knew it was destined for failure. It fell apart immediately due to the high moisture level in the shell - i.e. it was probably sitting in the case for sometime, piped with the cream. So, yeah, it was a mushy gushy mess and the flavor wasn't so hot. The cream was bland and a bit gritty, the shell wasn't crunchy whatsoever and the chocolate on each end was runny. I took one bite, hubs took one bite to try it and then it went in the garbage. 

Then the rugulach, dry dry dry oh my. Good thing I had a bottle of water in the car. We purchased two raspberry and two chocolate; suffice it to say that there were crumbs all over the car and two leftover rugulach that went into the trash. 

Now, I know I went on a Sunday afternoon - and many bakeries only bake once per day. However, if they would just bake the cannoli shells and pipe them every few hours, that would really make a huge difference to remedy the texture-less mess. I may try Nova's once more for their bread, but I won't count on it for any treat runs.)"

In the end, I found my way clear to sample a large format hefeweizen and a black ale, and while the skies continued to open up, I settled into a bar stool and some haphazard conversation.

The service was efficient, although not particularly friendly but the food came up quickly so I was able to make my connecting flight easily.  I had to laugh when the server asked me for ID before she would bring me a beer.  Must be their policy as a guy that was obviously older than me at the next table was also asked.  I decided the drinking age must be 50 in North Carolina! (kidding)

The food was okay.  Their namesake chili was bland and lacked anything remotely interesting in it but it was hot and filling.  And know to ask when they say, ""the beer is in a bottle"" what kind of a bottle they are talking about.  I thought I was going to get my fav beer in a glass bottle, but what I ended up with was a wide mouth aluminum bottle.  Not my favorite.

But all in all- still probably one of the better choices in this airport.  And my lunch didn't cost an arm and a leg.

My wife and I went to Chuck's for Brunch two weeks ago for Saturday Brunch. Calling it a Bruch is a misnomer since with the exception of burgers and a few fast food grill items, it's just a Breakfast menu.

We got there around 12 and they close at 1 pm so they were out of a couple of breakfast special items.  My wife is not a breakfast person so she order Salmon Patties and a side of fruit.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare, eggs cooked well, hashbrowns and toast.  The reason for order the ribeye medium rare is because it's always overcooked and I was hoping for something around a medium.

Nope - well done again. To compensate, the eggs cooked well were runny. At least the hashbrowns and toast were excellent.

The room is one of those places where they try and shoe horn more people and tables than the room can comfortably accomodate.  Went to the rest room to wash my hands and had to walk a maze around people, tables and chairs to get there and event then, I had to ask some patrons to move just to get through.

The restrooms need a bit of an upgrade, at least in lighting.  There is one common sink for both the men's and women's  bathroom located outside the restrooms in between the entrance to the two.

As far as service, this was the high point.  Our server could not have been better. She was there when we needed her and not there when we did not not need her. Could not have been better.

Prices are very reasonable and for that reason, it's a good value.

Before we left,we looked at the full menu and specials for the rest of the week. Much more expansive with a lot of other options on the menu, particulary of what we call comfort food. Maybe Saturday Brunch is too limited.  My wife did make the comment that we should try it some other time during the week to explore those other options.)"

Inside, it reminds me of a Charleston-style restaurant - very beach focused with a large bar and a smattering of tables. We were interested in actually sitting on the deck, at The Deck, so we rolled on upstairs and grabbed a table with a view of East Blvd. My review is solely based on their drinks, but I'm definitely interested in heading back for some nosh!

The drink menu is really diverse and our friendly server mentioned that they do their best to use natural ingredients - they even make their own sour mix in house. The five of us ordered all different drinks - beer, wine, and I ordered the Deck margarita. The margarita was right on par for $9, it was fairly large and had pleeenty of salt on the rim. Mmm sodium.

All of our drinks were tasty and priced moderately for the area. I definitely want to head back to The Deck for some drink specials, a bit of live music and to try their Strawberry Basil Lemonade!)"

It is at the south end of the light rail station, on the side closest to South Blvd. Inside, a nice lay out with high top and low top tables. Most of the seating is stools that have no backs. This is nice for 15 or 20 minutes but after a half hour, it's going to be uncomfortable. On a nice day, the outside chairs might be more comfy.

On to the main event, the ramen. I went right to the top of the menu, the Tonkotsu. A ton of different individual flavors and textures in this large bowl of pork broth and of course, a big serving of ramen noodles underneath the surface. Very tasty, a little messy, well worth it.

While they do have a good selection of beers and several other drinks in the cooler, water is a good idea for all the sodium you'll be enjoying.

You will want to wear something in a dark solid color or with lots of colors on it. This stuff does splash.

Parking. Well, I found a metered spot on the street. But there is also a parking deck with a few free hours next door too. Oops.),(Charlotte has always had a kind of ramen-bowl shaped void in it. Sure, there's a few places that offer it on the menu. But finally, we have a ramen house! 

I love what Chef Michael is doing here. The menu is authentic, but not traditional Japanese.  All the noodles here are made from scratch in house using hard red winter wheat from Lindley Mills, NC. We love local\/regional! 

From the Izakaya (small plate) menu, I've had the Pork and Scallop Gyoza, the Rice Crispy Squares, and the Low Country Smoked Pork Belly. They're all good. For me, the Rice Crispy Squares are the must-order app. Not only is it a gorgeous plate, but the combination of the spicy tuna, crispy square, and sauce is just fantastic. If you don't like raw tuna, don't get this dish. Note on the buns, they come two to an order. 

My favorite ramen bowl here is the Fire and Ice. I love the flavors of the kimchi broth and the smoked salmon. I've had both the Tonkotsu and the Miso (hungry). They're both good, but for me I think the Fire and Ice has the best broth. I always ask the server to bring me some spice to add to my bowl. The F&I doesn't come with an egg, but my friend Tom doesn't like them so I always get his. Score. 

Make sure you check the Fresh Sheet posted inside on the wall to see all the special offerings of the day. The hamachi crudo is perfection. They also do a different ice cream flavor daily. Be sure to ask your server. Coke comes in a glass bottle. Sorry Diet Coke fans, you get a can. Muahahah (that's my evil laugh).

Everyone is really nice here, but the service tends to be on the slower side. Not a huge deal breaker or anything, just know that going into it. I always sit outside because I like to people watch along the light rail.

Location: your GPS may get confused. It's behind Crispy Crepe on South Blvd. Turn there and you can park on the first floor of the deck behind Crispy Crepe. Futo Buta is then located on the corner on the back side of the parking deck. It's right there on the Bland Street light rail station.),(Futo Buta doesn't take reservations, so expect a short wait if you have a larger party in the evenings (even on the weekdays, it seems).  My colleagues and I (group of 5) waited around 15 minutes for a table on a Wednesday evening and eventually decided to squish into a 4-person table rather than have to sit at the bar... awkward for conversation.  If you're lost, Futo Buta is located on the corner on the light rail side, making it easily accessible off the Bland light rail stop.

Atmosphere is similar to an izakaya, if you've ever been to one.  Very casual and semi-loud. 

For a ramen joint in Charlotte, I wasn't expecting much.  Reigning from NYC, I've had my share of decent ramen.  I was surprised that the ramen at Futo Buta is actually not bad at all - I prefer my places in NYC, but this will do while I'm traveling.

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and added the chili to make it spicy (extra $1) - spicy it was.  I order the same thing at every ramen place, thus being able to make somewhat of a comparison among the different ramens I've had.  They serve the curly kind of ramen noodles here, versus the thinner kind, which I prefer.  Regardless, the pork bone broth was flavorful and the spicy sauce added a huge kick - warning for those that might not like that high of a spice level.  I was really impressed with the pork (char siu) here - it was just the right amount of fat-to-meat ratio and was marinated really well in a semi-sweet sauce and charred to perfect.  Probably some of the best meat I've had in ramen, actually!  The ramen here also comes with a poached egg.  At $14, the amount of food you get is reasonable.

In addition to the ramen, I also ordered the uni (sea urchin) nigiri (2 pieces, $7).  The uni was decently fresh (I haven't gotten sick) and I actually enjoyed this as an appetizer.  The salted radish was crunchy and refreshing.  I think this was supposed to come with some watermelon of some sort, but I don't recall seeing it.

Service is decent.

Worth a shot if you're in the area.  I don't know if there's any other comparable restaurants that serve ramen nearby.),(Futo Buta never disappoints! The service is wonderful, when you walk in you're greeted by the owner and the servers are so relaxed in how they speak to you, its all part of the atmosphere they hope to create. The interior is clean, modern wood. I don't want to spoil it for you, so don't forget to check out the bathrooms!

My last experience I sat outside and enjoyed the great patio set up. Bright, fun green plastic chairs make for a quieter experience instead of hearing metal dragging across the cement like most places. The planters create a little nook, and the tables are perfectly spaced apart so you don't feel on top of other diners.

My waiter was so kind due to my friend getting lost for over 20 minutes. He didn't make me feel bad about waiting so long and checked on me. When she did arrive we ordered 2 ramen bowls with pork belly, a soft boiled egg, and lots of other goodies. It was perfectly hot, incredibly flavorful, and I had leftovers for dinner. Next time I will be trying those steamed pork buns because the picture someone has put on Yelp looks awesome!),(4.5 Stars

Futo Buta is a ramen shop that opened up in May 2015 in the South End area of Charlotte, NC.  According to their website, the chef, Michael Shortino, was introduced to the kitchen since the age of 5 with his father (who was also a chef).  His grandfather and father taught him the importance of integrity of each dish and over his culinary career, he fell in love with the high level of integrity in Japanese cuisine.  Shortino's focus for Futo Buta is on scratch-like authentic ramen, gyoza (fried dumplings), Japanese fried chicken (tori kara-v age), amami (soft serve in innovative flavor combinations), and more.

I tried the following:
- Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza - loved it!  Definitely made FRESH!
- Salmon Belly Nigiri - pecan wood smoked, yuzu mayo, tobiko, maple soy, micro chive - also loved it!  The Salmon Belly was super FRESH!!
- Tonkotsu Ramen - pork bone broth, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, organic mushroom, onsen egg, pickled ginger, nori, sesame, black garlic - MUST GET!  I loved the pork bone broth flavor with the black garlic.  YUM!!

For dessert, it was a green tea ice cream with honey.  YUM!!

We forwent apps and went straight to entrees paired with a few Sing Ha beers. Ordered the Pud See Ew, #2 spicy, and chicken. It was fantastic. Those wide noodles are executed so perfectly and retain such a unique and smoky flavor. The #2 level of spice was enjoyable and served up a balanced twinge of heat throughout. About the same as a moderate helping of Sriracha. 

My wife ordered a veggie dish with the same wide noodles. Can't remember the name, but the flavor was so peppery. I'd order that myself.

Though I see some hiccups, bottlenecks, and negatives, this place serves up some comparable fare for those craving one of America's favorites foods between two slices of bread.

We made it in for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. The interior is almost a curved shape with the main line funneling down the center of the restaurant. This is one of the biggest losses. It doesn't utilize the space well and tends to create an odd line that blocks walkways for the rest of the restaurant traffic and staff. I think this can be circumvented easily, however. The staff is awesome, thoughtful, and kind. Very nice people all around. 

Again, it was busy, but it did take over 15 minutes for our food to be brought to our table (two salads and two burgers). Not the biggest deal in the world. I was just really hungry, haha. 

I ordered the custom salad. Spinach\/ice berg, jalepenos, black beans, shrooms, carrots, chickpeas, a veggie burger for protein and the balsamic. The salad, although delicious, was so skimpy. A cereal sized bowl and definitely not worth the price. If it were even 25% larger, it would be worth it. I was just craving a bit more of the additional veggies and would have loved to have seen more in the bowl...and a larger bowl at that. 

Though I cannot comment on the burgers, they look absolutely fantastic. The care that is taken is evident and their product really does look amazing. Looking forward to coming back fora burger...or three!

BIG BONUS! They have a 40\/20 challenge! 40oz burger in 20 minutes. I can't WAIT to try this!),(Formerly BT's Burger Joint as others have noted over time.

Was in the area today and decided to stop in for lunch at American Burger. American Burger purchased BT's Burger Joint last year but the listing for this restaurant has not chnaged and since others have left their reviews for this restaurant here, I am doing the same.

Walked in a went to the counter. Apparently you order and pay at the counter, take a number and deliver it too your table.  Decided on the Rise 'N Shine Burger which is a standard burger topped with a Fried Egg.  Rather than call it a combo, I did what they called 'Boxed It's which means got it with Fries and a drink which in my case, was sweet tea.

Paid and took my number and started to look for a table. While there are a number of tables inside, most had not been bussed from the last patrons but I did finally manage to find one.

About 10 minutes later my burger arrived in a paper lined basket accompanied by a knife in case I wanted to cut the sandwich. Since everything except the drink was in a paper lined basket, I fail to see why the tables were not bussed since it should have taken less than a minute to dispose of the remains of lunch, spray the table with sanitizing solution and move on.

Started with the fries which while still pretty good, were under cooked and limp. The Burger was messy because of the grease of the burger and kept sliding apart. That's when i discovered that a fork would have been nice but none were to be had. Made for very messy eating.  Picking up a cooked burger patty with my bare hands is not my definition of elegant dining.

Burger was properly cooked but since I was never asked now well I wanted it cooked, I assume there is only one way. That said, properly cooked does not necessarily equate to taste and that was the case here.  Very bland, very little beef flavor and as mentioned before, somewhat  greasy.

Not the best burger and can not give it high marks for either the quality of the food, atmosphere because of issues with messy tables, service because of no utensils.  If these items had been addresses, the price of the burger would have been reasonable but with all of these things put together, it's not a good value.)"

The chips and salsa were quite good. Not a puree of tomatoes, there were actual pieces in there. A bit wet, so it's drippy. We also got an order of guacamole to go with it. It arrived in a medium sized bowl and it looked like a lot. Until we got near the bottom and discovered that it was sitting on a small nest of shredded lettuce. Oops. The chips were hot and fresh. Thinner than I'm used to, they had a habit of breaking off in the guac.

Deep menu of burritos and tacos and salads with Mexican beers, sangria and margaritas. When I cut into my ""chicken"" burrito, it turned out to be beef. The waitress was most apologetic and offered to replace it (she said the kitchen made it wrong even though she ordered it right) but it was good so I stuck with it. My daughter had the Elvis special which is a bucket load of food. Unless you are a serious eater, I'd recommend you move on to something else. My wife had the chicken taco salad which of course comes in a massive fried tortilla shell.

The music and noise in the restaurant is extremely loud. The pictures on the wall and the angles of the walls do nothing to absorb sound at all.

They say it's TexMex, but I dunno. It just seemed like fancy Mexican to me.

Parking isn't easy but it's doable. Try the parking deck for Southpark if it's legal.),(There is nothing better when you are hungover than chips, salsa, and queso. And a giant Coke. And a nap afterwards. 

This isn't your typical Mexican joint. The decor is wacky. They sell hysterical t-shirts. The place is massive. I'm pretty sure you could play an endless game of hide and seek here. 

The chips are light, the salsa has a kick to it. They have a ton of different sauce options here. I really like the queso. Menu wise, I think I get something different each visit based on what I'm craving. I'm a big fan of the Classic Tex-Mex enchiladas. I mean, how can you go wrong with something covered in chili and cheese? Chuy's also does daily specials and has different drink deals each week night. 

I've always had great service and everyone is so nice here. It's hard not to smile when you're here. It's just a fun and happy place.),(If you're not from Texas (Where the stars at night are big and bright *clap clap clap clap*), then I'm sure this will be a godsend of TexMex. Though I'm not a huge fan of the decor -- loud, loud, loud, cumbersome, kitschy, overtly awful, weird, funny, and loud, the prices are incredible for being located in SouthPark. 

If you're not into paying $15-20 every time you're in SouthPark for dinner, Chuy's might be your new spot. The most expensive menu item I saw on the menu, that wasn't a dinner platter, was between $8-$9. Now, I don't know if these prices will inflate after time, but for right now, it's super easy on the wallet. 

The food itself? I was surprised. You're not really going to get authentic here, but what they're plating from the kitchen is pretty damn good. I ordered the fried shrimp tacos. Wasn't a huge fan of the breading, but the tortillas, accoutrement within, and the sides were spot on. Paired with one of the house margaritas (I'm not a fan of any of the beers they have in-house) and you've got a pretty good meal. We shared a few apps, too. The queso that has beef and a few other confetti-type peppers\/veg was awesome. The chips are thin, so double up to avoid breakage. 

The service was going bonkers, but very efficient. In my god-given grace, I decided it was a great idea to wail my arms about in telling a story and spilled an entire glass of water on and under the table. The bus team swooped in like freaking ninjas and cleaned everything up. 

So, though I feel like I may detach a retina from looking at the decor, I'm actually looking forward to revisiting Chuy's. Next time? The patio.

I did not plan on writing this review today, but after some of the most egregious customer service I've ever received, I could not resist. For those who regularly see my reviews, you'll notice two common comments:

1) I try not to kill a business with a review due to one part-time employee having a bad day.

2) I've written nearly 1,100 reviews, and only 9 are 1-star, at the time of this visit. I try to be positive, even when a place doesn't offer a ton of positivity. 

With that being said, let me paint the scene:

-My flight from Tampa-Charlotte was delayed, so I had to sprint from Terminal E - Terminal B while wearing Tom's and carrying 2 bags.

-I arrived at my gate, feeling like I just ran a marathon, only to learn that I missed the opportunity to board by 2 minutes. Awesome.

-I made arrangements to board the next flight and felt the need to find a good beer.

-How convenient? Right next to my gate was a restaurant\/bar, called Whiskey River! 

-I take two steps in to said establishment, look for the beer taps at the bar, and realize that there aren't any within sight. 

-I turn around and ask the one of hostesses if she has a beer list I can see. She hands me a menu.

***THE FUN PART***

-The other hostess (named Kaylan) then addresses the other hostess and loudly asks, ""Hey _____, can you tell me what the sign right outside the restaurant says?""

Other hostess: ""See hostess to be seated.""

Kaylan: ""Ohhhh that's what I thought! And can you tell me what the sign back there, just beyond that sign says?""

Other hostess: ""See hostess to be seated.""

Kaylan: ""Yes, that's what I thought too!""

I drop menu back on hostess stand, and walk away.

Apparently Kaylan found it wildly inappropriate that I took two steps inside the threshold of the business to look at the taps, without addressing her first. She then dealt with the situation in the most rude way possible. I can't recall dealing with someone that rude at a restaurant in all of the time I've been writing Yelp reviews. If I were the owner, there is a zero percent chance that she would be employed another day.

I have never written a review of a business without actually purchasing something, and I have never written a review within 30 minutes of an experiencing a place. This situation was so outrageous that I felt like I had no choice.)"

At first blush, this particular Kabuto isn't necessarily impressive from the outside or inside. When you walk in there is a room with a decent sized bar and a smattering of tables for the sushi eaters or hibachi haters - you choose. Since I was in the mood for a show, we choose to have the whole ""experience"" of hibachi and we led in the back room with eight or so double hibachi tables. 

The menu is standard Japanese hibachi, running $15-$23 for your choice of protein(s). The accompaniments support the shoveling of food: clear\/green onion soup, ginger salad, shrimp appetizer (2 shrimp) fried rice, vegetables, noodles and your choice of proteins. So...where did Kabuto falter a bit? The service was pretty solid, the hibachi show was mildly entertainment, but the food...was uninspired. Don't get me wrong, it was fine. But when I see a talented hibachi chef using big pads of butter to cook all of my food, it turns me off. Thus the food tasted like bland butter, not the crispy, tasty, fresh hibachi I love (where they typically use oil). 

My other minor beef is that the food came out all at once - there was little to no pacing. So, everything butter laden was dumped on my plate. Meh. I'm giving this Kabuto three stars because our server was super attentive and the food was fine, but not great. However, I don't think I'll be back considering I enjoyed the whole experience at the other Japanese steakhouse just down the road.)"

Genghis Grill is similar to their full size restaurant format, except that instead of building your own bowl you get one of their premade bowls. I assume that you can add or remove any ingredients, but I went with the Firecracker Shrimp as it comes.

A good amount of shrimp with bean sprouts, onions and peppers. And a lot of spice. This was HOT. Lots of hot pepper and their ""dragon sauce"" on it. And that's a good thing as it was tasty and filling and it took me a good 15 minutes to eat.

Probably not the kind of food you want to eat on the plane. There are many tables here in the atrium area where you can get some sunshine and watch the folks coming through TSA security.

By far, one of the better choices in CLT for a meal.),(Why 2 stars? Because it's one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.

   ---   ---   ---

I used to eat at a local Mongolian grill very often in high school, and I was pretty excited to be reunited with one during my layover in Charlotte.

I can excuse the fact that my order was forgotten, and I had to wait much longer than everyone else around me... mistakes happen. What I cannot understand is how they can, in good conscience, serve the Mongo BBQ bowl. Honestly, it's one of the worst tasting things I have had in a very long time.

I can't imagine the President of Genghis Grill visiting this location, tasting this dish, and saying, ""yep... that's the Genghis way!""

I mean, it was just awful. Even if I don't like something, I usually end up finishing the whole thing, because I'm a human garbage can... but I couldn't stomach finishing this.),(This is located at the airport inside the US Airways terminal. Great place if you are in the mood to consume something nourishing, and healthy. I had the vegetarian dish called the Buddha Bowl. It was pretty good, and filling. It was also very inexpensive. In today's economy, that's a good thing.),(Wow. The three stars is for the food and well I won't dare judge the entire staff on ONE BAD SHEEP aka ""Doris."" The food is pretty good but I only took a few bites because the lady at the registered messed my order up. When the sweet, sweet cook brought up my order and explained that she can whip me up another bowl because its not correct the cashier yells turns to us and shouts ""let her take it, let her take it."" It's not just about me but about other customers who instead of being welcomed with warm energy have to deal with a lady who has a huge attitude. Listen you old hag, (kidding, kidding, LOL...I'm totally not mad LOL so allow me to find humor in the situation). I'm not going to get punked into your poor customer service skills... She needs another job. Perhaps she angry because she's having a rough\/long day... Whatever is going on in her life's reflecting through her work and energy for sure. HOWEVER Gerald the manager who also owns my favorite place next door (Carolina BBQ) is a total sweetheart and he showed us southern hospitality, he gave me a full refund and discount on food from his other joint which I fell in love with at first bite! 

Try the food. Pray to God you get someone else to take your order and say Hi to Gerald and let him know what a fabulous job he's doing! I'm sure enough to say this is a 4-5 STAR place if not for the one wrong decision made in the hiring process.),(Decided to skip the BBQ next door today and try the stir fry. If there's a line, it's definitely not as fast so be wary of your time. I went with the Chicken Teriyaki which comes with an assortment of veggies and your choice of white rice, brown rice, noodles, or udon. I'm a sucker for udon so I chose that. The noodles weren't a s thick and chewy as traditional style ones I've had so I'd maybe try the chicken fried rice option next time. For the money, you get tons of food. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. Everything's cooked to order too so its piping hot when you get it. You could easily take this to go because it comes in a resealable tupperware style container, but the smell would be pretty potent if you were to take it on the plane.)"

The best way I can describe the Spay Neuter Charlotte Clinic: it's basically like the health department for pets. It's such an affordable option for pet care. Yorkies have really bad teeth and must get them cleaned annually. At my normal vet, it costs a ridiculous amount of money. Ridiculous should be in 54 point font. Here, it's a fraction of the price. Seriously, I wasted so much money over the years by not coming to this place. 

I love how they write the names of all the pets on the chalkboard doors each day. Everyone here is really nice and you can tell they love what they do. I can't say enough good things about Elizabeth Welch. She's such a good person and I know Marley is in goods hands every time I bring him here. 

They get pretty busy, so make sure to book an appointment plenty ahead of time. The dental cleanings especially. Check their website, they also have monthly specials. There are clinics in both NoDa and Pineville.),(Wonderful price and great staff. Only $75 here versus the $375 from Petsmart! I feel like they cared about my puppy as he received his neuter.

However I was lucky enough to experience this hidden find before it even opens. Located in downtown Charlotte on the ground floor of the 505 Building at the corner of Sixth Street and North Caldwell, 
behind Time Warner Cable Arena and across the street from Villa Francesca 

Kalu is an Asian kitchen, bar, and lounge...you will be amazed by the cuisine and the surrounding of this place. The artwork is unbelievable and a spiral staircase leads the way to a magnificent lounge upstairs. The restaurant will be serving 8 sakes never before served in the USA. Living in LA for a few years this definitely reminds me of one of those hip celeb hangouts...however saying that do not hesitate to walk in its definitely not stuffy and the staff is extremely friendly. 

The restaurant features western style tables as well as a large sushi bar that lights up in all sorts of different colors, a lounge upstairs, and a large bar and lounge area looking right into Charlotte's skyline. I can't wait to take the girls here for some drinks when it opens. 

The Chef Bryan Emperor is a top 7 samurai sushi chef and brings years of authentic Japanese culinary training. I did get to try an amazing dish of his... a whole main lobster grilled and topped with a garlic miso sauce the presentation was amazing... I can't describe it well enough so I will post a photo. 

I think this will definitely be a first for many food lovers...from sushi, dim sum, Maine Lobster, Kobe Meatballs, and individually cooked rice in iron pots. Truly a culinary tour I have yet to experience and can't wait to try.),(Ahh our second anniversary...we wanted to make it special and try out a few items at KALU to start the night off right. Overall, an B for effort, D for execution. 

Hubs and I made an 8 pm reservation on Monday night...yes, I expected it to be pretty dead on a Monday evening, but it was our anniversary so we didn't care. We drove up and circled the building for 10-15 minutes trying to find a place to park. After pulling into and out of a handful of different restricted parking lots, we chose the lot across the street from the restaurant. The sign said $5 after 7 pm but the closer of the two scary little boothes was ""out of order."" So, we rolled in to sit down.

Upon entering we asked about parking - where the eff do you park around here? The lot across the street, for $5 apparently. And make sure you pay, because they do come often and check! So, hubs trekked back out to the working (scary) booth to take care of it. FYI - the booth takes cards. Overall, not an awesome start...and they don't have valet on the weekends either.

On to the ambiance - it's lovely inside. Tons of modern Asian influences and big, BIG tables - which was a bit weird for us and we were sat at a 5-top with only two people. Not so romantico, but whatev. Our waitress, Lolita, was super sweet and offered a few different options to work through the menu...I will say, though, if there were more people in the restaurant we wouldn't have been able to hear her! She is incredibly soft spoken. Chef Bryan is also extremely hospitable and really made sure that we were comfortable with the menu and ensured that we enjoyed our dishes. 

And food...here's what we ordered:

KALU Ginger Ale: 2\/5: An interesting and super sweet combo of ginger ale and an assortment of upscale booze. A little too sweet for me. 

Wasabi Roll: 4\/5 (on the house): Chef Bryan sent this out and made sure that we could ""handle the heat."" Indeed we can! It was a great start and completely cleared my sinuses! I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was different versions of wasabi, shiso and rice. 

Rock shrimp tempura: 1\/5: Mah-jah bummer here. I was expecting something completely different...I read tempura shrimp and seasonal vegetables...what came out were huge clumps of french fries with a tiny amount of shrimp and scattered veggies. 

Pork Shu Mai: 2\/5: Meh...I didn't like the flavor of the pork...but I know hubs did, though. Not a bad deal for the price...3 for $9. I'd like to try the shrimp next time. 

Wagyu steak: 3\/5: (cooked on the rock): A delicious cut of meat, albeit extremely overpriced at $25. Instead of the pesto topping, it was made with black sesame - a really nice touch. 

So, will I be back to Kalu? Doubtful...especially considering the cost!)"
osSwv6CJy5hDKQdOKeyTow,"Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.197737681,-80.8527190503,Ru San's,554,4.0,"(Practically an institution, I've been to Ru-San's at least a dozen times, always for lunch. The self-serve buffet of sushi isn't the absolute best quality, but there are usually a few good finds. They usually have salmon or tuna sushi as well as several of their creative and innovative rolls. At least half are fried, which is always an interesting option. This is, after all, the South. :-)

You can easily avoid the fried stuff and focus on the raw fish. Plenty of options, even on the slower days, the stuff doesn't sit out there for long. On the back table (you didn't know there were two?) are usually a steam tray with lo mein and egg rolls and sometimes fried chicken drumsticks and wings. I've spotted big trays of tuna and salmon sashimi there on occasion.

You can't beat the price. $10 with water or $12 if you get a soda. That's a deal and a half!

I love it. One of these days, I'll have to return for dinner.),(You've gotta love cheap sushi. Even if it isn't the best you've ever had, you cant argue with $1 for 4 rolls. Just like pizza, it's all good, baby. 

Ru Sans is definitely worth a visit if you're new to the Queen City or visiting some friends. Don't expect to be blown away, but its great social food. If you're coming with a big group of loud and fun people that love to socialize, you're in for a treat. Ru Sans is awesome for a night out. Do a couple of sake bombs (if you're into that) or just watch all of the bankers do them. HILARIOUS.

Two words: LUNCH BUFFET. If you haven't had time to experience it, you're missing out. Again, not the most mind-blowing sushi you've ever had, but the array of choices and other non-sushi items is worth the coin. 

Service is kind of meh. Lackadaisical at best and certainly not super attentive to things like, oh say.....drinks? You might go thirst for a couple minutes, but fear not. 

The atmosphere can get a little bit tight at times. You'll be squeezing in between chairs and tables to make it back to your seat. Also, the bathrooms are tucked behind the kitchen in a long hallway. Pretty cool, if you ask me. Kind of feels like you're part of the kitchen for a hot minute. 

Love the art on the walls. Not sure who the artist is, but they are awesome and intriguing. 

Definitely worth a try if you've never made it out. Take a bunch of friends, grab a cocktail or do a couple sake bombs and enjoy the semi-glorious sushi. 

Cheers, Ru Sans. You're doing what you do rather well.),(I am not a buffet girl and yes of course I have tried Ru San's lunch buffet it's a great deal but I still have no desire to go back for the buffet.  However I think Ru San's still has some of the best deals out there for sushi, and the sushi is good and fresh. 5 pieces of Sashimi for $7 and these are not skimpy that is an awesome price.  For someone who likes to indulge in sushi a couple of times a week this place is great!  You can also get Nigiri pieces from $1 to $2 a piece.  This place is busy and stays busy for a reason it is great for groups if you can get a table.),(42 piece sashimi sampler - This is a boat load of sashimi.. literally a huge boat. I would recommend against it even though it's a good deal because it includes alot of sashimi that most people are afraid of eating (e.g. Uni - looks like poo, Octopus - has tentacles, Shrimp heads - self-explanatory...)

Snow White Roll - YUM

Sushi Tart - butter on top of sushi? Excellent idea. Hard to share, but delicious.

Steak Roll (special) - Good for the unadventurous. 

Kobe Steak Appetizer - Good steak, the sauce was a little too sweet for me.

Salmon Sashimi, Rich and Famous, Yellow Tail - Always a winner

Tuna Poke, Tuna Sashimi - Always kinda... meh.

3 egg sushi - WHOA, too overwhelming. Could only eat 1.

And they also have half off bottles of wine during Happy Hour!),(Wow....I have never been here for lunch during the week........and I have never seen nor experienced the buffet......but I did this last Monday.

It was a bank holiday, so I decided to have a little sushi for lunch and headed to Ru San's.  At 2pm in the afternoon I expected this place to be dead....I was dead wrong!

It was packed and I was told about the lunch buffet.  $10 for all you could eat of both sushi and a small hot tray area.

I quality of sushi was ""ok"" though without names I wasn't sure of about 80% of what I was eating sushi wise.

Wait staff were all over the place, but did get my beers in a timely manner so no issues there.

PROs - I was glad to get my fill of sushi  at a really good price.......

CONs - The mass of people and craziness was not for me.

Still love the place........but without the buffet.),(I like Ru Sans. It's good if you're craving sushi and you want something quick and easy. The vibe in there is very casual. The food is good, but it's far from fancy. They have a good selection of rolls and the prices are reasonable. The waitstaff is also quite good.

The lunch buffet is craaaazy. It's a great value, but it's unlike any sushi buffet I've ever been too. It's pure chaos. But they have a lot of sushi and non-sushi options. If you're willing to put up with the chaos, it's a great deal. 

I tried the ramen there and although it tasted good, it wasn't authentic ramen. If you're used to ramen in NY, SF or DC, don't order it here. But it's not a bad soup. 

I like it here if I want something quick and easy. I'm not blown away, but it's pretty good. Ideally I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I tend to round up. 4 it is.),(Who knew North Carolina could have awesome sushi??

The white tuna here is really FRESH!  My friends & I got a plate full of it... literally.

We also got what looked like a tuna martini (forgot the actual name of it) and it had 3-4 types of tuna on skewers in a big martini glass. Very nice!  Two of my favorites were seared tuna & sesame encrusted tuna.

I also ate this sushi with three eggs: quail, tobiko & tamago.  I wanted to spit it out.

I don't think this place is meant to be super fancy; it was a hole-in-the-wall feel but it's still pretty good for it's price.)"

The chocolate cakes were delish and the lemon cello),(I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too. 

But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time. 

I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night. 

The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it. 

Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific. 

You know what to expect with the cheesecake factory... huge menu, diverse selection, decent service, great cheesecake.)"

I looked over the menu board and settled on the ""Season's Mod"" which had roasted Brussels Sprouts, red onions, gorgonzola and a balsamic glaze. And while that probably would have been enough, I also took the recommendation of one of the Mod Squad and added chicken. Good idea!

A few minutes later, my name was shouted and I stepped up to pick up my pie. Sliced into four neat quarters, the thin crust pizza base was nice and crunchy. Plenty of toppings and it tasted absolutely amazing. Full of great flavors. Very enjoyable.

The place: It's an establishment. Gus's has been around for some time and it shows. It's an old school Southern diner esque, classic meat & three, etc. And that's completely fine by me, but the building is showing some major wear and the menus are a bit crusty and food laden. You only get one chance to make a first impression...

The staff: As mentioned, everyone here is kind and sweet. The kind of place where the server calls you ""hun"" and probably has for 30 years. 

The food: Just not bueno for me. On Gus's menu, he purports that he uses only farm fresh veggies from his actual farm. Well, it didn't look like it in my ""crisp"" salad. My bowl of greens looked, and tasted, straight out of a mixed greens bag. And the lettuce was swimming in cool water with a touch of dressing. For my main lunch course I chose the cheese ravioli which came out crusted and baked with oodles of plastic-y cheese. The sauce tasted canned and the ravioli were essentially tasteless.

Came down to visit the Latta Arcade\/Brevard Court and while we were here, to grab a quick lunch on a beaufiful Saturday. After walking up and down the venue and reviewing a number of tempting menus, we decided on French Quarter.

The narrow confines of Brevard Court does remind you somewhat of the narrow streets and alley of the French Quarter but the comparison stops there. Nothing on the menu to suggest anything from Bourbon St.

Still a nice Greek\/American menu with something for everyone.

Walked in and were seated immediately and were given our choice of where to sit. We picked a table by the window overlooking College Street with Romare Bearden Park immediately across the street. 

Both our host and server were great and efficient along with the young man I assume to be the manager.

From the menu I chose the Corned Beef Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was excellent and one of the best I have had in a long time.

The French Quarter Salad is worth the trip itself. Large bowl lined with Pita's with and a mound of lettuce in the center and not just lettuce but a bounty of tomatoes, cucumbers, large fresh Croutons and an incredible amount of Chicken.

My wife always complains to salad that are just about all lettuce and maybe one sliver of tomato but not this time.

Fun spot to hand out. With construction and  Jazz festival at the Park, parking can be a bear but we ended up in the parking garage next door. 

Three of four blocks from Bank of American Stadium, one block from the BB&T Ball Park and within walking distance of a number of Arts Venues and Museums, this could serve as a good place to grab a bit when you visit downtown.)"

I probably should put that in my Yelp profile somewhere because it's true. Another one is ""Money is to pay people to do things that you don't want to do yourself"" but I digress. We're here at Aldi, where it's all about less expensive groceries and produce. They trim their costs by not having big fancy displays or endcaps, with a very limited selection (typically only one brand of an item and only in one size) and a limited staff (typically two cashiers, a stocker and a manager). You need to have a quarter to get a shopping cart (you get it back when you return) so that they don't have to invest in a cart wrangler or tie up parking spaces with cart corrals.

If an Aldi shop is convenient for you, why go anywhere else to spend more? Maybe some don't like this low cost method of doing business, but that's fine. You're paying more to enjoy that convenience and ""higher touch"" shopping experience.

You'll want to bring your own bags, as Aldi charges for those.

As Chad mentions, Aldi does NOT accept credit cards as it's another cost thing. You have to bring cash or use a debit card.)"

Unlike some of the other frozen yogurt places that have more of a creamier tasting product, Pinkberry has a tartiness that some like and some don't. You'll want to get a free sample to see if it is to your taste before making a commitment. I found that the right topping addition cut the sweetness and really make for a delicious dessert. I'd recommend going with the nuts and not so much the sweeter toppings.

After trying their pumpkin and chocolate, I ended up with a small cup (the next size up from kids) with the plain (vanilla).

Good service from a youngster who knew the product and was more than happy to help me figure out how to enjoy it as well. I'll be back!),(I'm a huge fan of the FroYo scene in Charlotte and I'm happy we have Pinkberry as a part of it. Where my first choice will always be a local joint, these guys do bring a pleasant experience every time. Always eager to educate on their flavors, benefits of yougrt\/probiotic and toppings. 

I'm savvy on the peanut butter flavor and blood orange whenever they have it. Amazing flavor to capture in yogurt. Not easily done and scarcely done well. Pinkberry definitely has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to toppings. The dark chocolate crisps are something from heaven. Incredible little morsels of crispy chocolate joy. We actually had them at our wedding with our froyo bar. The only downside is the fruit. A little large cut for my liking. Not a deal breaker, just don't typically order any fruit on my yogurt due to the larger sizes. Small dice is the way to go. 

We frequent Pinkberry often. I appreciate their flavors and always look forward to their other seasonals! Cheers to FroYo!),(You have no idea how excited I was to see a Pinkberry opening in Charlotte just one more wonderful memorabilia of my days living in LA.

Pinkberry did not disappoint - the only problem now... how am I going to stay away.

I snuck a mini original with strawberries, coconut, and mangoes in my purse to go see The Town this weekend - I would have waited till after the movie and not have commit ed the crime of bringing in outside food but I had know idea that Pinkberry would be open so late - to my astonishment Pinkberry was still open and it turns out their open till 1am on Fridays and Saturday... this will be my new late night spot.),(I have driven by Pinkberry, waiting for it to open, it seemed like it took forever!  Finally at last, it's here.  I had never had Pinkberry, I knew that a froyo craze existed.  I even told one of my friends years ago, that he should open up a Pinkberry when he was asking me about business ideas.  I bet he is wishing he would have listened to me now, seeing the lines out the door.  I wonder if it will die down or at peak times it will always be bonkers.  Hmmmmm, something to ponder.  

I had the original flavor topped with mangoes.  Yummy, I sat there and ate the whole thing, thinking of my Yelp review and taking photos.  Looking at the cute decor and watching the young kids do their coporate zombie customer service thing. Welcome to Pinkberry!  The kid at the register asked me a goofy corporate question, I wish I would remember what he asked me.  Maybe tomorrow when I return, he will ask me again, because I know that I am addicted.),(How can you not love pinkberry? So tasty and refreshing. You can customize it to include fresh fruit or more decadent toppings like chocolate, marshmallows, even mochi. The pinkberry that I used to go to in Virginia always had a crazy long line. This one gets busy, but it's never as bad as Virginia's, so all the more reason for me to go. This location is also clean and the staff is extremely friendly.

How could you not be? Solid food and a truck with a giant Asian Pac Man on it? Sign me up all day.

My first Yummi Banh Mi experience was during a NoDa FAM event and the line was a mile long. Okay, maybe it wasn't a mile. I have poor depth perception. But, it was long and a long wait for food. This was back when they were first starting. Add to that: everyone wanted to try out the cool looking new truck. I remember being annoyed and thinking this better be worth it. I went with one of the rice bowls. It didn't look like a lot of food until you started eating, but tt was so filling and delicious. I was hooked. 

So what should you order? I don't think you can go wrong with any of it. I've had the rice bowls, tacos, and the banh mi sandwiches. The BBQ pork and the lemongrass options are all delicious. There is also tofu, if you're into that kind of thing. It's hard for me to order now because I really do like them all. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone who works on the truck is super nice. 

How to find them? Follow them on the social medias. They post their schedule each week. Congrats to Scott on all his success so far. The Observer just did a great story on him and the truck a couple weeks ago. Nice to see good people doing well.),(Have you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy lemongrass chicken in a rice bowl?

Five Yelps.),(Yummi Yummi Get In My Tummi!

My buddies and I were on our way down to Charleston for our friend's wedding and needed liquid caffeine (aka coffee aka the nectar of cacao) for the 3.5 hour drive. We literally parked behind the Yummi Banh Mi food truck and that's when I realized it was destiny for me to order something. We were in the Third Ward neighborhood of Charlotte. 

Initially walking past it, the truck was closed. It opened at 11 a.m. and we got there around 10:40 a.m. I stood and stared at the menu for a good 4 minutes before one of the workers came out and said ""Hey man, we'll be open soon, so you'll get your banh mi soon!"" We went to the Starbucks and got some coffee. I thought the coffee would quell my hunger for the banh mi, but it only amplified it. I went back out and there was already a dude standing to get his food. It was 10:52 a.m. I knocked on the door of the truck and the worker came out and said he could take my order. Score!

I ordered the Lemongrass Pork Banh Mi. For a $7.50 price tag, the sandwich was pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless. Pork was seasoned well and it came with pickled carrots, cucumbers, and 2 pieces of jalapenos. 

A+ for the customer service, A for the food, A- for the price, and A-mazing for the yellow theme truck with the bomb ass logo!)"

Excellent salmon on a bagel with capers for Mrs. K. A lovely bagel with egg and cheese and ham for me. Delish. Just sad about the coffee.),(I don't think I've ever actually written a love letter, so I guess it's time to change that. 

Dear Owen's, I love you. I don't care how long the line is, you are always worth the wait. You make me happy when skies are gray and are the perfect remedy for my worst hangover. I would totally be in a committed Facebook relationship with you. Translation: that's a huge deal. When you had to temporarily close because a car ran through the wall, I felt like a family member had died. 

I discovered Owen's about ten years or so ago when they first opened. I selfishly wanted to keep it a secret. It's tucked on the end of the little shopping center on South Blvd next to Polished. Leather and Lace is on the other side of it. Don't stare directly at it during daylight hours.

So what do you need to know?
*There's a line on the weekends. It moves quickly. Be patient. 
*Home of the steamed bagel! Ton of options (including veggie) on the menu. You can even build your own. If you can't find something you like here, then maybe you should talk to yourself in the mirror. The problem may be you.
*There's graffiti all over the walls
*Don't see a spot in front? There's a parking lot behind it

I don't have a go-to order here because I like too many things here. My new current-crush and go-to is the Nice Piece of Ash. Great name. It's like a Kool Jules or South End Special on steroids. Who's Ash? She's the owner and a local Johnson & Wales Alum. That's right. Locally owned. 

Owen's also does catering and you can call in your pick-up order ahead of time. They also have giant pickles. I ask for it cut in four pieces and then I don't share them with anyone. Hours alert: they close at 2pm on Mondays and 3pm all the other days.),(What's not to love? Tucked inside the Pavilion in Southend, crazy art on the walls, banners, notes written in sharpie, mismatched chairs, rocking chairs, and an odd layout to boot. Needless to say, it's PERFECT. My kind of spot for a good breakfast or any time, for that matter. It's like a Common Market met a grungy record shop and then decided to focus on bagels. I just love this place. 

Parking can feel a bit odd since there aren't many spaces out front and it's so close to South Blvd. I'd park where ever you can find an open space. 

The menu is extensive with tons of crazy concoctions. There are plenty of more breakfast-style choices but tons that will appeal to the lunch bunch as well. My favorite for an anytime or good breakfast -- Mary's Grubby Bubby. Tomato, avocado, egg, and muenster. I was stoked to see they had some bialy left, too! Tried it on for size and it was amazing. I love making bialy at home and Owen's really hit the spot. 

Though I didn't grab a cup of coffee with my breakfast, the roaster they use out of Raleigh had bottles of cold brew in the cooler. Love trying new cold brews and loved that Owen's had this for sale. Picked up a bottle on the way out. 

The service is great. Homeboy was nice and took care of like 6 people after I ordered mine. That guy had some hustle, too. He then came out and took care of the entire room while everyone was eating. One man teams like that are hard to come by. My hat's off to you, my friend. 

Owen's is numero uno if I'm ever in Southend and craving a bagel. Next up, I'm going for something a little heartier! Can't wait to come back again. It had been too long since my first. Thanks, Owen's!),(I love me some bagels. Large doughy goodness and covered with schmear, please. And Owen's Bagel & Deli certainly delivers - in a big, creative, steamy way. 

I've frequented Owen's many a time and I always appreciate the local, hippy vibe that rocks through the scrawled upon walls. It's a very casual haunt, where you can grab some morning breakfast or a quick lunch. You'll see all sorts of customers here - from the church crowd to the hungover college kids. The bagel connoisseurs who work at Owen's are very laid back and friendly. Be prepared to chuckle while reading their menu - they have incredibly creative sandwich names like The Mark Cuban and The Tonya Harding Club. 

While I've tried many delicious bagel sammies here, but I always go back to my old standby - the Banana Surprise. It's a cinnamon raisin bagel, slathered with cream cheese, covered in bananas and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. It's incredible. Husband always orders a Mr. Turkey with egg, also a delicious choice. All the bagels and bagel sandwiches are steamed and that makes them super tasty and chewy. Oh, and their coffee is local, which just makes me love them even more. 

Head on over to Owen's for a monstrous steamed bagel sandwich, and if you're not full enough, make sure you grab a cookie on the way out - they are the size of your face and a sugary dream.),(Reading the recent activity on YELP about Owen's, I had to find out for myself.  I went  today and had a bagel and a cup of coffee.  My coffee wasn't hot, it must have been the bottom of the press pot but for some reason, it didn't bother me and they still get 5 stars.  They were really nice, my bagel was served hot and delicious.  Their coffee is Larry's Beans, so Owen's is supporting a NC business, so we should support their NC business!!!  Right?  

Owen's takes pride in their food and it shows, they also serve Boars Head meats and you can go to Leather and Lace and get a lap dance afterwards, now that is full  service..

I will rate Owen's Bagel & Deli four corn dogs.),(4.5 stars!  This was one of my favorite places to eat.  Owen's Bagels & Deli is known for their ""Steamed"" bagels.

Nicely plated so that it was all fresh when it arrived home, I had the chicken and the beef eye separate, with bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, noodles, chopped green onions and sliced onions as well as two small pots of hoisin and Sirracha. Very impressive.

I also got an order of summer rolls which were quite fresh and tasty after a ten minute car ride.

Two huge pho and the summer rolls, less than $24. Good deal!),(It takes a lot for me to stray away from ordering pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. There's just nothing like it.. especially on a cold, rainy night. However, I did my homework on Yelp beforehand and knew I had no choice but to cheat on my go-to.

I ventured here with a group of Yelpers. We got a bottle of wine and some apps to start off the meal. Tonya recommended the fresh rolls, but with the grilled meat. I usually get mine with shrimp. Never again. The flavor with the meat was so much better. We also got a giant yellow pancake. I think most people get this as an entree. If you have a group, it makes for a great app to share. Filled with shrimp and all kinds of other goodness, cut off a piece and wrap it up in a piece of lettuce. Make sure to dip it in fish sauce!

I studied pictures on Yelp ahead of time and knew that I wanted the spicy lemongrass shrimp. Was it worth a temporary break-up with pho? Hell yes. Will I now be forced to order both pho and this when I come here? Probably. Dan C let me try the broth on his pho. Delicious. For my vegetarian friends, they have a ton of options here. 

We got an avocado smoothie to share. I highly recommend. So unique and different. I'm not sure if I could drink a whole one by myself. The Thai tea was also great. I could probably drink one of those in two minutes.

It's a little inaccessible unless you tend to hang south of Tyvola on South Blvd. We made it in for a late lunch and were thrilled. 

The inside is quaint and not over the top with decorations. Just some simple tables. The menu, per usual, is vast and has tons of great options for both meatatarians and veggies alike. We ended up having to take our order to go due to some pressing errands, but the service was exceptional while we were in the restaurant. 

We ordered some rice paper rolls. Very standard and quite delicious. 

I ordered the standard Pho. Traditional Pho is served piping hot and the beef if typically served raw on top of the bean sprouts or somewhat ""floating"" on top of the broth. It is meant to be stirred in to the broth, thus, cooking the beef, or perhaps more a faux boil. This was a little bit of a shock since we had to get it go and the beef was still raw. No sweat at all! Just a little surprised it was still going to be raw. Knowing is half the battle. (Thanks, GI Joe)

The Pho was AMAZING. Some of the best broth I've had and the veggies were incredible. I absolutely love Vietnamese and Doan's is now way up there on my list.),(Doan's is a clean, new, restaurant on South Blvd. Had to go check it out the minute I saw Rod O's review.  He was right, can't wait to return and try some different items, my test item is always vermicelli with pork and spring roll.  I ordered V7 which was pork, chicken and spring roll.  Get crazy!!

Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Make sure to ask if they have the house made chili sauce!  I was just there yesterday and I already want my dish again.  Why is fish sauce so addictive?),(I've decided that this is my favorite Vietnamese spot in Charlotte. Don't get me wrong, I like Saigon palace, Vietnam Grille, and even Akahana (over in Plaza Midwood...I know I know, that's more ""fusion-y"" but I digress)

I like Doan's the best because it has everything that I like (and would care to order)and does everything that I like very well. Some restaurants you keep coming back to because of a signature dish. I keep coming back here when I know that I want Vietnamese, but not sure exactly what I'm in the mood for, and not once has it disappointed. 

Pho-check
Spring rolls-check 
Rice paper rolls-check
Bun bo hue-check 
Bo Luc lac- check 
Banh mi-check 
Hot pot- check
And even more...

I'm not going to get caught up in the debate as to who has the best pho or anything like that. To be honest, everywhere I've ordered pho since moving to Charlotte has made it pretty well. No complaints.

But Doans wins, hands down, because it has it all...for me at least. And all that I've listed above, I've tried and have been happy and satisfied each time.

To top it off, I like the inside of Doans. It's not particularly fancy or especially plain. It's very clean and has a good atmosphere for a casual meal. The service is terrific and everyone treats you very well in there. 

It's also a good value too. They have daily specials. (keep an eye out for those) also it's Not too pricey. And personally I think that the portions are fine.

All in all an A from me. Definitely recommend!),(Pretty solid. And definitely hit the spot after a day of much manual labor, and no lunch! Fairy new, and better presentation than your standard Vietnamese restaurant. Good table service, and not a lot of wall art clutter. 

I started with the fresh rolls. While they had a lot of filing, I prefer the daintier glass noodles than the thicker white ones they use. And the peanut sauce could have used more hoisin. Wanting something more substantial than pho, I opted for the egg roll and pork vermicelli. Egg roll was sub-par, but the dish came with a lot of meat and plenty of fresh veggies. I like my bowl to be layered; and here the presentation is more like a pie chart of ingredients all atop the bun. Changes the eating experience some, but it still tasted delicious!

I'm not an avid ice cream goer, but whenever I get to visit EC its alway so nice to try a new flavor. There is always something you haven't tried since your last visit. Last visit, I had the mint oreo and it was fanstastic. No big chunks of cookie, nice and smooth. Versatile enough to be in a cone or a cup. 

I've had tons of other flavors in the past. Coffee, Red Bean, what seems like 50 different kinds of chocolate. All delicious and all unique in some way. Rather reasonably priced for being hand crafted and in the heart of Elizabeth, a stone's throw from Uptown and fantastic. 

Gotta love the funky interior, too. Really strange chairs. My recommendation is to head out and walk around Elizabeth Ave. If it's a pretty day, its just nice to be on the street. It's a relatively quiet avenue. 

Read the story that's on the wall in the shop. What a great little tale of a man making ice cream. Definitely will make you appreciate his craft even more.

I was extremely disappointed in the dining options as there was only 2 available restaurants and both were Asian which I thought was kind of strange. You can probably finish going to all of the stores really quickly.),(This place isn't run of the mill, and here is why: 
- In addition to having so many high end stores
- There is beautiful outdoor seating
- Outdoor fireplaces
- Lots of parking
- Modern and beautiful!
- Different experience from a typical ""mall""
- Just a ten minute drive from the Charlotte International Airport

What I didn't care for was that...
- There are not a lot of choices for foods
- The layout of this mall is not simple.  Not sure if that was by design to be unique, but it's easy to get lost.  
- Some of the food trucks that are usually there aren't always.  For instance Ben & Jerry's.  Maybe you'll see them in their usual spot, or maybe you won't.

This was the first year for the festival, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. The setup was fairly similar to Oktoberfest. There was a great mix of local breweries, bottle shops, and national brands. I like that there was even a wine tent. You know how it goes, there's always that one chick who bitches because she doesn't drink beer. Well, why did you go to a beer event?!

I didn't get a chance to try any of the burgers. I heard a lot of great things about Pint Central, Vinyl Pi, Heist, and Mattie's. Bang Bang took home the trophy for best burger. Doesn't surprise me, that place is just up the road from me and is great.

Is the VIP worth it? I would say for this festival... yes. You get early admission, some special beers tapped just for the VIP early admission crowd, and burger tastings. IMO, it's well worth the extra money. 

Ancient Cities and Langhorne Slim were both fantastic. Langhorne puts on a great show. Langhorne got on some guy's shoulders and came out to the crowd to sing. The chick next to me says he always does that. Pretty cool.

I love events here because there is a ton of parking and it is free. However, it's a beer festival. Don't drink and drive. Call a cab, an uber, or your mom.

Kudos on such a great inaugural event. Looking forward to doing it all over again next year!)"

Sported a menagerie of choices for our brunchtacular adventure -- Country Benedict, pimiento cheese grits, creme brulee French toast, Neese's sausage, and the morning frites. The sides were fantastic. The grits are rich, but not overpoweringly. The frites work wonders on your palate with the mix of peppers and onions. 

French Toast reminded me of what I grew up with. Thin cut, easy-going, not overtly sweet, hot syrup on the side, and powdered sugar. YES.

The Country Benedict. Duuuuuuuuuude. I've never been a fan of eggs Benedict, but the hollandaise on top of the perfectly poached egg, on top of a wonderfully buttered\/toasted piece of sourdough (or maybe boulé) worked so well.

Did I mention it's the size of a pizza I always eat 1\/2 and bring the rest home where I dream about it until I can eat it again.  It's seriously that good.  The servers are always friendly and accomadating even when they are slammed I love that!),(French food in Plaza Midwood? Sure, sounds great - let's give it a go!

Hubs and I rolled into Lulu quite literally at 5 pm...hoping for an early bird special. Well, not really, but we were the only customers in the restaurant. That being said, our service was just peachy. Inside Lulu is quite adorable, albeit a bit nondescript. For a French eatery I was expecting more Parisian flair, but instead Lulu is charming, quaint and comfortable. The menu is pretty diverse - everything from mussels, to calamari, to pork. They also have a great wine list with some fabulous French wines. 

We had plenty of time and attention to choose a smattering of inspired dishes, I samples the: Calamari, French Onion Soup, Mimosa salad and Chocolate Bread Pudding. First off, the calamari was delectable! It's lightly fried and accompanied by the tastiest ""Asian love sauce"", which is a conglomerate of a myriad of spices...I'm thinking Chinese 5-spice? The portion was plenty for two of us and it also comes with an Asian slaw. Mmmm!

Hubs ordered the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, which I promptly dug my spoon into. Taaaasty! Real Gruyere bubbling over flavorful onion broth and large slices of onion - absolutely spot on. I went a bit lighter on my meal - the Mimosa Salad. The salad was full of mixed greens, two toasted Brie chunks, apples, spiced walnuts and topped with a light coating of super delicious champagne vinaigrette. It's the perfect summer salad, IMO.

And lastly, dessert. I toyed back and forth between their classic Creme Brulee and one of their feature desserts, Chocolate Bread Pudding. Sadly, this was the only disappointing part of my meal. I should have listened to our waitress when she mentioned how delicious the Creme Brulee was. The Chocolate Bread Pudding wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok. It tasted more like a nice French toast than a chocolate bread pudding - I especially didn't taste any chocolate in it. 

Le sigh - I guess I'll just have to come back and try a multitude of desserts! :))"

Inside, Sole is offers a nice sized bar and plenty of tables. Our server was very attentive and recommended some great starters (tapas) for the table to share. I was a big fan of the cold, ceviche like tapa with fresh seafood and boat load of cilantro. The gambas al ajillo were ok, but they were suffocating a bit much in the pool of oil. 

For my meal, I ordered the scallop dish that offered a fairly bland tomato base and saffron rice. I believe my dish was $19 - not too bad, but a little pricy for a few scallops and saffron rice.

What to order: 
Appetizers: you really can't go wrong with any them. Keep in mind though... you have a lot of food coming.

Meal: The specials are all really good. However, you absolutely can not go wrong with the filet and shrimp scampi combo. The filet cuts like butter. The shrimp.. perfection. Bonus: dinner comes with a side and salad. At most steakhouses, both are extra. The salad spread comes to your table. You get to make your own. All the dressings are homemade. Feeling naughty? Get the blue cheese. Every calorie is so worth it.

Dessert: I don't care how full you are. Get apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.

Hubs and I serendipitously hit up B&B on a Monday evening...for half price wine night! Yes. The entire wine list, bottles and glasses are half priced on Mondays and Thursdays. And it's most definitely worth noting that the wine list is pretty fab and spans across plenty of taste profiles and price points. Jordan, Cakebread, Mirassou, Cambria, Mondavi, Stags Leap and more. 

Let's talk about the meal and the overall experience:

Salad: 4\/5: Comes with a steak (or entree). This is appreciated! The dressings are definitely made in house and I like the make-your-own salad option. Veggies were fresh, too. 

Filet mignon, 6 oz: 4\/5: My filet was cooked as I requested and I enjoyed the nice char on the outside. Mmmm hmmm. 

Cocktail shrimp: 2\/5: I ordered the special of the evening that came with my choice of a shrimp side. Since I was informed the cocktail sauce was nice and spicy, I went with the shrimp. Sad, small, soggy shrimp. They had no ""snap"" to them at all. The cocktail sauce, however, was pretty snappy and spicy. 

Baked sweet potato: 4\/5: Also came with the order. I love me a baked sweet tater. Cinnamon butter sugar on the side! 

Onion rings: 5\/5: Even though my order only came with one (gratis, natch) I was thiefing onion rings from hubs' plate while he was attacking his strip steak. 

Ambiance: 3.5\/5: I dig the old school decor, but it super, super dim in here. However, it was almost hard to see your dining partner at times. The booths, however, are large and comfortable and there's an addition added on to the back that looks similar to a covered (and I assume air conditioned) patio. 

Service: 5\/5: Kindly greeted and seated and our server, Nicole, was friendly and very efficient. We never went without full water and wine glasses and she made sure we always had everything we needed.

I was able to find a few things that weren't just battered chicken with sauce, including a spicy chicken (looked like mostly white meat) that tasted of curry and something with yellow rice that seemed to be a vague ""arroz con pollo"".

The sushi is standard for a Chinese buffet: sticky white rice and a few california\/crab rolls. The avocado ones had not had a chance to oxidize, so I knew they were fresh. Nothing special but worthy of a ""three star"" attempt.

Lots of non-Chinese options, including pepperoni pizza, quesadillas, mac and cheese, pigs feet and french fries plus peel-and-eat shrimp. I did see at least two ethnic dishes, one of which was squid in garlic sauce. This one certainly looked authentic enough for me to walk on by. :-)

Desserts included the standards for these places - banana pudding with (knock-off) Nilla wafers, chocolate pudding and assorted sheet cakes in various flavors. They also had apricots, lychees, peaches and pineapple available (straight from the can is my guess) and a bunker of individual ice cream cups and ice cream sandwiches. Surprisingly, the brand was ""Hershey"". I expected a soft-serve machine or something more generic. Thumbs up here!

Plenty of parking and plenty of seating. Well lit. Even at the busiest time, I don't think that there would be much of a wait. The floor around the buffet tables was rather slippery. I don't know if there had been a recent spill or if this is a normal thing, so watch your step!

Overall, while it had a large selection and the price was right ($7 for lunch), I found the food rather bland. If you don't mind that and you want variety and lots to eat, this is the place for you!

They delivered! I had a glass of rosé - I opted for the larger pour, which was about a glass and a half.

When you walk in an L-shaped bar is on the left with ample tables on the right.  The wine menu is more genorous than the food, but both are excellent.  I would say the only draw back is that the wine glasses are a little over priced and the none of the dishes on the menu where robust enough for a hearty pallet.  

All in all Beaudevin is everything you wouldn't expect inside an airport.  Good food, artfully done with pretty reliable accuracy paired with a rather impressive wine list.  Flying fancy free in Charlotte with a littlke time to kill - dine fine at Beaudevin.),(Beaudevin made my 2.5 hour layover in the Charlotte airport fly by (pun intended).  I was having such a good time sitting there drinking my wine and eating my cheese that I almost didn't want to leave when it was time for my flight.

If it was anywhere else, I'd say it's 4 stars, but because it's in an airport terminal, and by miles the best restaurant ever in an airport terminal, it gets 5 stars.

There's bar seating as well as a small area with couches and normal tables, and I opted for a table with outlets nearby so that I could charge up all my electronics.  The service was amazing.. the hostess\/waitress stopped by to make sure I was always taken care of with drinks, water, food, etc and when I asked for the bill she offered to charge my card at the same time, since she knew I was hurrying to make a flight (after sitting there casually for 2 hours I almost missed it ha).

They have an extensive wine list and every food menu item has a suggested pairing.

I had the open faced chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  It came with 4 pieces of bread topped so it was a generous serving size for the price.  Because it was so good, I knew that I wanted to try something else here. So I decided to overeat and also had a small cheese plate paired with the suggested Riesling.  The small cheese plate is also very generous for the price, and probably would have been enough for me as a meal. I still ate most of it.

With the AA \/ US Airways merger now underway, I may be spending a lot more time there. Because of Beaudevin, that's now an okay thing.)"

Our bartender was buried in the weeds between a full bar and tickets shooting out of the service well, but she handled as well as can be and with a smile on her face. Kudos to her, I would've been miserable. 

Though tempted by the mimosa special, I channeled my inner adult and stuck with a Coke. I got queso and the #9 combination. The queso comes in a little cast iron skillet that sits on a stand over a lit candle to keep it warm. My combo plate had two empanadas, two stuffed jalapenos, two tacos, rice and choice of beans for $12. There's a ton of protein and wrapper (including lettuce leaf) choices for the tacos. I did a blackened fish (you can also get it grilled or fried) with a flour tortilla and a beef with corn tortilla. I enjoyed both tacos, but the fish was my winner. The jalapenos were stuffed with chicken and cheese. I was full, but couldn't stop myself from eating them. Fish tacos and stuffed peppers will definitely be must get items for me when I come back here. 

Things to know: kids eat free on Mondays (with a purchase of an entree), $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and various drink specials every day. There's free parking with two different lot options. Hot Taco also has a nice patio area that's perfect for people watching in South End. Make sure to check in on your Yelp app, right now you can get a free appetizer!)"

Dough pressed and laid out, then the pizza is assembled in front of you. Unlimited toppings and yes, they mean unlimited. The pizza is oval shaped, similar to the sort of pizza that I enjoyed in Rome. It's a thin crust. And it's quite tasty.

I opted for the ""Angry Sauce"" and topped it with cheese, mushrooms, red onions, red peppers and grilled chicken. The pizza wasn't five minutes in the oven and then it was boxed and ready. A great deal for $10. More than enough for one. Almost enough for two.

They have a couple of bottled beers in the cooler and a Coke Freestyle machine.

Zablong is located in the Latta Arcade, closer to Romare Bearden Park.),(Dear Zablong, you are my life saver late night when I have consumed a few too many adult beverages and you are also equally delicious on sober days when I am in need of lunch. 

The two best things about this place: they are open until 3am on the weekends and three words: ghost pepper salami. Seriously, GHOST.PEPPER.SALAMI.

Zablong is a fast casual type concept where you can order from their menu or build your own. There is a laundry list of toppings. No matter how you want it, it's the same price. Less than $10. My current strategy here is to get the Meathead with angry sauce and add mushrooms, jalapenos, pineapple, sundried tomatoes, and crushed red pepper oil. What can I say, I'm a toppings whore. For the vegans out there, they have a lot of great options to fit your desires. For me, I can turn into a pizza into two meals. 

The workers are always super friendly and happy, which is a lot to say when you're open until 3am and dealing with drunk people. They probably all deserve hugs and holidays named in their honor. 

Zablong, thank you for being the spot Latta Arcade and the alley has needed. You are doing God's work over there.),(Super friendly employees and really unusual pizza. I've had it second hand before (as in my friends catered a get together with it, and it was barely lukewarm when we ate it, but most people other than myself were too drunk to care), so I went to the source to try some different stuff fresh out of the oven... but they don't do slices, so I haven't been able to try any hot and fresh yet. The cold-ish slices were around 4 star but they intrigued me, however they should really sell pizza by the slice here, if only for my benefit.

When they say Zablong, it sort of means Oblong, I guess, because that's the shape of the pizza. They remind me of the shape of Beaver Tails in Ottawa. Couldn't taste more different though. The Vampire Slayer was amazing at the party except that nobody who had eaten anyone could make out with anyone afterwards, no amount of mints and teeth-brushing can fix that damage.

One thing I'm not crazy about is having all the toppings laid out in front of you like a Cali-style pizza spot, or a Subway or something. It just reminds me of Chipotles and Millennials. Not that there's anything wrong with Millennials, but a lot of that sort of food, to me, is garbage. This place is not, so don't get distracted by the format. It's really good pizza. I'm not ready to give it 5 stars yet though.

Apparently Za is pizza and Blong is belonging. But I still think it's connected to the oblong nature of the pizza.

Anyway I'm off to listen to the Linkin Park song, Somewhere I Blong.),(Zablong is located in the French Quarter by the park.  It seems to be frequented by both business travelers like myself (saw someone walking into my hotel with one!) and locals alike.

Service here was impeccable - the employee was helpful with explaining to me how everything worked and what all the options were.  He even helped suggest some pizzas I might like.  I eventually built my own, but he was kind, friendly, and patient.  5 star service for sure!

These pizzas are massive.  At $10.06 after tax - it's really a steal.  It's also too much pizza for a single person, so I'd suggest sharing or planning to save half for the next day.  I like that they have whole wheat and gluten free dough options here.  There's also a ton of sauce options, along with meat, cooked vegetables\/cheese, and toppings such as basil and other kinds of cheese you can add on your pizza afterwards.  You can't really go wrong here - especially when you can build your own.  May I suggest ghost pepper salami, angry sauce, artichokes, and the GARLIC PUREE!!!  Don't forget the garlic puree, you garlic lovers like myself!

My only thing was the pizza became a little soggy after only a very short walk home.  They also don't really have that many options as far as spice goes - no red pepper flakes (at least when I was there) and only hot pepper oil.  You can add fresh jalapenos, but that's a little scary.  Otherwise great deal, great service, and great food!),(My go-to spot for pizza in Charlotte. Enough said. 
- You either BYO (Build-Your-Own) or choose one of their signature pies.
- Pizzas are built in-front of you. Perfectly assembled. I had many pies already, and it rarely hit a false note.
- Then baked in conveyor oven.
- Fresh toppings are added for the finishing touches.
- The tripping goat is to die for (without the crumbled goat cheese for me.) I don't want the poor goat to trip.
- Pay flat rate ($9.79+tax.)

Why you should embrace Zablong?
- Best part about a night of drinking, is the eating after. It's pretty predictable, and my favorite is always yummy PIZZA. So going over to Zablong for a pie before the night is over, is a good idea. Trust me. Zablong last call around 2:30am Fridays and Saturdays.
- Perfect for quick lunch.
- Vegan and vegetarian options are available.
- Location. Location. Location. At Latta arcade.

CxsN79g8rZoouLwZvr_FVg,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Vegan, Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional)",Charlotte,1,35.2009674,-80.84275229999999,Fern,381,4.0,"(My wife made the decision to eliminate meat from her diet a few months ago. No beef, no pork, not even chicken or turkey. No shellfish, but fish including salmon and mahi mahi is still cool as are eggs and dairy. It's been an interesting time trying to eat around this new program, especially since my daughter and I are unrepentant flesh-craving carnivores.

For this week's family brunch, I offered to try a restaurant completely focused on vegan and vegetarian options. Fern hit the spot with great reviews and options that I felt would minimally inconvenience us meat eaters while giving my wife options other than salad.

As Mrs. K. is still figuring out vegan, I could see that the menu was a little complicated. So while we studied it, I got us started with coffee (with almond milk. Stevia and Sugar-in-the-raw on the table) and the cinnamon rolls. The rolls arrived and we were able to place our brunch order. Tasty and doughy, not too sweet at all. Yum.

Sausage and gravy for my wife, Mediterranean scramble for daughter and the zucchini\/spinach benedict for me. It was clear by what was left when we asked for the check who had enjoyed their meal most thoroughly. It was me - my plate was clear. The zucchini fritters were tender and moist, sort of like a crab cake except without crab. Topped with steamed spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise, really tasty. I'd recommend it thoroughly.

The scramble wasn't that great, according to daughter. Rather bland, she said. And she didn't care for the quinoa. Oh well. Mrs said that the biscuits were too cakey but the gravy was good.

For sides, I had the crispy braised fingerling potatoes. It was as close to home fries as you're going to get and they were perfectly crunchy and salty. The sweet potatoes were good (tender and sweet), but not the best choice for their brunch meals.

Service was excellent. The coffee was great. And the price was pretty decent.  I don't know that we'd return for brunch, but only because it's challenging for the carnivores. Maybe lunch or dinner next time. That said, you herbivores would love this place.),(Though not much has changed with bathrooms or the parking since my last review, but I have a few factors that bump up my thoughts on Fern per my last visit. 

Queen's Feast drew us in with the menu lineup for the week and boy, oh boy, was it incredible. Big bonus for several of the items landing on the regular menu, too. 

Deconstructed onion soup. Whoa. Great broth, incredible flavor. Savory, a hint of sweet, and the presentation makes it rather fun. The server pours the hot broth over the dry\/veg ingredients in the bowl and then mixes all together. The parm crackers served with are wonderful. 

My first experience with their ""chicken and waffles"" and I'm a believer. The fried tofu could probably fool firm chicken nugget lovers into thinking it as meat. The waffle and spicy syrup -- magic. 

Huge plus for having some leftover 12oz bottles of Highland Cold Mountain. We drained a few, which worked nicely with the meal. 

Looking forward to working Fern in more regularly. Next up: Brunch.),(I, like Hailey H, typically don't lust after veg-only restaurants, but after a visit to Fern I can honestly say that I'm still craving a bunch of dishes there!

The vibe inside (and on the patio) of Fern is great - a nice, chill and green accompaniment to their menu. Service was on point during my lunch and my server was well educated and happy to lead me through the menu. She also mentioned that she's not a vegetarian and loves the food...and hey, that means a lot to us carnivores. The menu features vegetarian and vegan options with many of the vegetarian items available to be made into a vegan dishes. I can hear all the vegans rejoicing right about...now. 

My lunch buddy and I snacked on a few different items...all of which were good to great. 

Iced tea: 4\/5: I gotta say their regular iced tea (at least during the day I dined here), was orange and ginger! It was super refreshing and delicious. 

Indian Tacos: 5\/5: Three fry bread ""tacos"" piled high with a hearty mix of beans and squash and topped with lettuce, tomato and sharp cheddar. This dish was bangin' and very filling. Anyone who says veggie or vegan eats can't fill you up, must try this. 

Squash blossom hush puppies: 4\/5: Holy crap, I actually enjoyed vegan cheese?! Yes, lightly crispified squash blossoms filled with delicious vegan mozzarella with a side of onion ""butter"". I didn't go crazy over the butter but frankly, I don't think they needed them. The order came with three blossoms. 

Buddha bowl: 3\/5: Rice, a bit of faux cream, vegggies and beans presented beautifully in a bowl. The buddha bowl had potential but it was pretty bland for me. Everything was most certainly fresh, but I was itching for some spice somewhere in this big bowl of eats. 

Overall, Fern was really impressive and I think they have a great menu, inspiration and focus. Can't wait to go back and try more!)"

Sadly, the lottery scratch ticket I bought was not a winner, so no fifth star. (I'm kidding.)),(Typical convenience store with a decent selection of snacks and beverages.  I was very happy with the selection of local beers they had.

Yes, they have stuff that's not pancakes. But who comes to IHOP for a cheeseburger or a fish and chips platter? I mean, really!

Service seems a little hit and miss. Sometimes you get a waitperson who comes by quickly to take your order and bring your check, sometimes you get one who apparently decided now was a good time to take their 15 minute smoke break.

Dando features a tapas style dinner menu. I always order the stuffed poblano pepper. The lamb lollipops are another favorite. Honestly, I think I've had everything. Shrimp & grits, sweet & spicy green beans, fried pickles- depending on your mood, I don't really think you can go wrong. You can order ""Everything at the Market"" for $295. For lunch, I always get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It's perfection. Love their brunch- several egg bennie options, hangover hash, bloody mary bar ($7). Pro tip: make sure to ask about the quiche of the day!

Hours wise: dinner 7 days a week from 4-11pm, lunch Monday-Friday 11am-3pm, brunch Saturday-Sunday 10am-3pm. Bar is open until 2am. Couple dozen craft beers on draft and 25 wines for $25 a bottle.  After dinner, they pull the big community table upstairs up off the floor and up to the ceiling. Pretty cool. Great night spot for dancing. Even more importantly, it's an even better place for people watching. Enjoy. 

Great staff here, the service is always top notch. With so many new places that continue to pop up in Charlotte and uptown, Dandelion is still a go-to spot for my friends and I.),(Oooohhh cozy! That's exactly how I felt when I rolled into Dandelion Market last night. 

Dandelion Market is one of those comfy, yet minimalist, bars that can certainly appeal to a variety of peeps. I'm a big fan of the exposed brick and duct work engulfing the restaurant. Upstairs, Dandelion Market provides a beautiful and expansive space for even more drinking, eating and general hanging out opportunities. 

But let's get down to where they really shine - their beer offerings. While I'm not a beer gal, I was more than delighted with the Carolina Strawberry Ale, brewed just north of Charlotte in Mooresville. A hoppy mixture that twisted my taste buds with a strawberry effervescence. While it was probably ""chick beer"", I definitely appreciated the local love. 

That's the great thing about Dandelion Market's beer selection - a fair amount of them are local. Hooray! 

The service here was just great. Every bartender and server, on both the downstairs and upstairs levels, was just super friendly and laid back. It's the kind of place where you want everybody to know your name - and they definitely deliver.

I didn't get a chance to sample any eats here, but I look forward to coming back, grabbing a chick beer, listening to (another) great acoustic musician and relaxing in the market.),(Still a good fall back place when all other places are either closed or just too busy and perfect for Sunday brunch, but I still find their food a bit pricey for what you get.),(Dropped in for lunch today and had a delicious meal.

I ordered the boss sandwich, fries (per our server's recommendation) and a soda.

The sandwich was delicious, had a great flavor too it and the dressing was awesome. The bread was fresh and better that what I'm used to. And it was a nice, big portion. The fries were equally addictive and needless to say I had people picking them off my plate.

The service was great and the decor is cool. I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner or for a few beers. 

The prices weren't bad either.
My only complaint is that we didn't come for dinner. From the looks of the dinner menu they have even better options at dinner time. We'll definitely come back.),(I'm an easy mark for laid-back spots with solid beer selections, and Dandelion Market features both: lots of NC brews represented within, and this place was a welcome respite from a day that saw the Charlotte area awash in temperamental weather. Fortunately I had the good sense to come in out of the rain for once.

Dandelion makes an interesting first impression: the wall to your immediate right boasts a wall of shoe trees -- enough of them that I asked the bartender if there was some significance to the art installation. Nope, he said, they were pretty much just a wall of shoe trees. 

Hmm. Okay.

That said, upstairs plays differently from the more traditional Irish style pub on the first floor: dark, ambient, warm by virtue of its heavy wooden overtones, the acoustic act playing guitar when I stopped in seemed appropriate to the pervading vibe of the room. If I were around more often, it's pretty safe to suggest that upstairs at Dandelion Market might become a regular hang. As it is, I'll look forward to popping back in next time I'm in.),(I really love this place. I've been here three times now- for dinner tapas, lunch with a girl friend and also for Sunday brunch. It's in my neighborhood and has a wide variety of things to choose from- we got a ton of small plates to choose from (caprese to salmon cakes to brussel sprouts) when we came for dinner, which was perfect for two people to share. Shortly after I met a friend for lunch, where we both got grilled cheese and tomato soup- so great for these unseasonably cold winter days.

So brunch is interesting- it's served until 3 and all their specialty items look amazing. I settled on the hash and my BF got the migas. I loved my hash- full of potatoes, andouille sausage and okra- spiced to perfection and not too filling. The migas were pretty eggy though- definitely could have used more fillings and less egg. I also noticed a bloody mary bar (we just got coffee), which is also a cute brunch touch.),(So, first of all, a couple of disclaimers:
1. My only experience with Dandelion Market was on a Saturday night. 
2. I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene. 
3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments. 

So yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know. 

Nothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room. 

They've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it.),(So happy that I ate at Dandelion Market while staying in Charlotte. I only ate one dinner out during my short trip, and I'm confident that a visit here was the best decision possible.

The menu has so many fantastic sounding small plates that it can be tough to decide what to order. Because all bottles of wine were 25 dollars, we started there. 

After a great deal of consideration and some input from our very sweet waitress, we went with four of the small plates. Fried pickles, smoked wings, goat cheese and prosciutto crostini and short ribs. The portions were generous, and definitely were not as small as other tapas spots that I've been to. Especially the fried pickles, which came with more then I've ever seen on one plate. Because of that, we could have probably done fine with 3 items.

Everything was well prepared and delicious. The pickles were perfectly fried and crunchy, the short rib was melt in your mouth, the crostini was generously topped and the wings were smoked to perfection. Judging by the food photos and smiling faces around us, I'm sure that nothing on the menu would have been disappointing. 

The service was excellent and the prices were fair. 25 dollars for any bottle of wine is a steal. Next time I visit Charlotte, I'll want to try new places but will have a hard time not returning here. It's just that good!),(I love a tapas place as I often travel alone and these places allow me to add more variety to my meal. I was in the Queen City on business and my Yelp Mobile App led me here.  I liked this place enough to visit more than once. 

This place has a nice dark pub atmosphere.  It was so dark that I actually needed to use the flashlight on my phone a time or two to see the menu.  To me the emphasis seems to be on the bar as opposed to the restaurant.  The tables actually look uncomfortable.

One of my visits was on a Monday night and $3 drafts were featured.  Every brew was #3 and that means about twenty taps.  That's a great deal and at 7:30 the place was packed.  The beer list is decent and well thought out.  It's not Flying Saucer crazy big but it's broad enough to satisfy most beer folks.  They also have a short list of specialty cocktails that they execute beautifully. The Cucumber Mint Mojito was excellent.

By the way, the bartenders here are excellent and customer service was never a problem.

The first tapa I ordered was the BAKED POTATO CROQUETTES - $6 that came with aged cheddar, Beeler's bacon and scallion cream. They arrived quickly and were plated beautifully.  They were good but not great.  None of the flavors had enough intensity to really tingle my taste buds.  They are missing something and the chef needs to think that through.

Next up was SAUSAGE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPER - $8 with Italian sausage, cheese, and house made crema.  Now this was more like it.  This dish was bursting with flavors that melded together perfectly.  I enjoyed every morsel.

Finally, on another visit, I tried the MUSTARD ALE CHEDDAR SLIDERS - $9 with Beeler's bacon and  l&t.  What was inside the bun was one of the best sliders I have ever tasted.  It was juicy, perfectly seasoned deliciousness.  Unfortunately the bun spoiled what could have been an amazing plate.  First it was cold which is totally unacceptable and second it was slightly dry.  What a shame. The bun should have been fresh and grilled.  One again this was a miss by the chef.

I want to love this place and it has a lot going for it. The atmosphere and the beers are right on.  The menu looks fantastic but the execution was flawed with two dishes I tried.  It's time for some attention to detail.  I can sense greatness but we're not quite there yet.),(I'm always in the mood for tapas, and Dandelion hits the spot! It's suggested that you order 2-3 plates per person, and we found that 2 was completely sufficient! 

-Deviled Eggs: skip. The filling is less deviled eggy, and more like a pine nut hummus, at least on the day we went. 

-Fried Pickles: GET! A huge order of sinful goodness with the perfect horseradish mayo accompaniment. 

-Prosciutto Crostini: GET! Four crispy breads with goat cheese, fig spread, prosciutto and balsamic. Superb. 

-BBQ Short Rib: may order again. It was VERY rich, and after an already full dinner, we couldn't finish it.

I would gladly return! This hit the spot and was a total winner, and there were a few other tapas I was highly interested in ordering!)"

I've been wanting to try Bask for a while now & I had the perfect opportunity to do so last week. Hubs & I rolled into Bask at 6:30 on a Friday night...we wanted to grab a tasty dinner before heading to a show at Ovens. Inside Bask is pretty cool - high ceilings with exposed duct work, slick floors & tables and an overall smooth vibe. At 6:30 pm, the place was pretty dead on a Friday, but no worries. 

Staff were all very kind and laid back and were happy to make suggestions and walk us through the menu. The chef, Chuck, also came out mid meal to ask us how everything was and requested honest feedback. This is huge to me, especially with a newer restaurant. Chuck also gave some great suggestions on tailoring the meal...

Once seated we took a look at their very creative and cool cocktail menu, complete with varying & creative drinks - gin, vodka, champagne - you name it! On to the meal!

A couple things I ordered...

Citrus Fizz: 3\/5: I love champagne, so this citrus, champagne concoction looked interesting. It tasted just fine, but $12 for what seemed like a lemondrop shot in a champagne flute seemed a bit steep. The portions, however, were fairly generous for a champagne cocktail. 

Low country crab dip: 4\/5: Delicious steamy crab dip with fabulous homemade kettle chips. Great flavor and a perfect starter. My only complaint? I wish the chips were just a bit more crispy.

Fried turkey BLTA: 3\/5: This could be a total stunner if a few tweaks are made. We asked for the red pepper aioli on the side (suggested by chef Chuck) which was perfect with the flavors of the turkey. My gripe? I bit through a handful of fat & gristle from the fried turkey. 

Surf and turf: 3.5\/5: Delicious but heavy dish. The lobster saffron risotto was uber creamy and super tasty and the short rib was well cooked. This was our last plate of the meal (so I was already pretty full) and thus had a hard time shoveling down this rich plate of food!

Most important thing: you can place orders online. I really hate to order over the phone, so this is a big win for me. They also deliver.

This place is just a few blocks from my house, so it's a super convenient location for me. I usually just grab some take out, but I finally had my first dine in experience Sunday night.

Starving after watching the Denver-Oakland shellacking, we voted on Chinese and decided to head here. I always get soup and one of the combinations. This go round I went Hot & Sour Soup and Sha Cha Shrimp combo with brown rice and an egg roll. Huge portions. My roommate doesn't like this place, but when I brought the leftovers home... she was a big fan. She was shocked when I told her it was from Cherry House. Maybe she's just been ordering wrong? 

My other friend always goes curry when she does Chinese. She ordered the Curry Chicken combination here and didn't like it. I'm not the biggest curry fan, so I'll let her be the judge on that one.

For me, spicy mustard is a must for egg rolls. I got a side and whoa did it pack a punch. I loved it, but it may be too spicy for some so be warned. Soda is by the can, so if you down your drink... you'll have to buy another one. If you're getting take out and do need a soda (one larger than a can), there is a Friendly Mart across the street.

I love the decor. The cool old school light bulb type fixtures that hang, garage doors opening to the sidewalk, vintage Western movie playing on the tv... great vibe.

And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.

Hubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home\/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...

We were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. 

Since we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!

McNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration.)"

Off of I-485 this way, there aren't many places to eat. And this is a relatively new strip plaza, so when I pulled over to let Yelp find me a late dinner, I was pleased when this popped up.

I chose the fresh spring rolls with shrimp to start. These were prepared very quickly and were pretty good. A nice portion of shrimp in there with a bowl of cold peanut sauce for dipping.

But before I'd even manage to dig into a second spring roll, my Pad Thai with chicken arrived. Good texture and plenty of chicken, but the flavor was rather bland. No heat at all.

There were a couple of other tables, but they already had their food when I arrived. So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy? Or should I have spoken up?),(Alright I came back with an open mind and the Pad See Ew was still NOT ok.

You know what else is not ok? Being a waiter and not knowing what is on your menu. CMON!

The pad thai wasn't as terrible as the one at Thai House (near Ballantyne), but it was still not good. The texture of the noodles wasn't good, it was too saucy, and I didn't like the flavor. PLUS, they added peanuts when I said NO PEANUTS!

I guess I would be open to trying the curry, but I'm pushing this one down to a 1 star for now.

P.S. fortunately there was no line here today, but why is there usually a line at this place?!),(Color me happy, Siam Garden is a great little find.  It is way down on Whitehall Park Dr. in a business park.  It's so odd, you think to yourself, there is going to be a Thai restaurant down this road.  Amazing, on the outside it is very nondescript shopping strip mall, but when you walk in the door it is decorated like an ornate Thai restaurant, complete with gold headdresses with signs that read: Do Not Touch Headdress.

The lunch menu is basic, a couple of curries,noodle and rice dishes, Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever been to a Thai restaurant where the menu is different, they are always the same, no matter what city.

Lunch specials offer a spring roll and bowl of soup.  We ordered red curry and pad thai and ordered them hot, spicy, 3 out of 5.  They were perfect.  It was the hottest food I think I have had.  You know the heat that is so hot, you can't wait to get the next bite in your mouth to get the rush again.  But not too hot where all you get is the heat.  Very yummy. I am thinking, I might not want to eat Thai food anywhere else in CLT.

Service was really good too.  Quick and friendly.  I can't wait to go back with a group of people so I can try some more menu items.  I want to have a dinner party celebration and see if they will let me wear the headdress.)"

Three and Half Yelps.),(It was a busy night, so they told us about a 30 minute wait. Ok, no problem, we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.

The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.

Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.

There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.

The food was ok. I ordered 8 boneless wings in the flaming Parmesan sauce. The sauce had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The wings were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.

I also ordered the Steel Town Spuds with tater tots. You get a good sized portion. The tots come topped with ranch dressing, bacon, scallions and melted cheese. The flavor was ok. They brought out some buffalo sauce to dip it in and that made it much better.)"

Nx8qL3HqmuTvzIq8C7xPDA,"Restaurants, American (New), Soul Food",Charlotte,0,35.2279912,-80.843388,Savannah Red,38,4.0,"(I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that Savannah Red was actually an account of mine back when I used to sell wine, and I never actually knew what kind of food they served or what the inside of the restaurant even looked like. Since they were owned by the Marriott hotel that houses it, there wasn't much influence I could have over their wine list, and we already pretty much dominated it with some of our larger corporate profile wines. It's a shame really, because after dining there over the holidays I had a very good meal that would definitely warrant a second visit.

Although the hotel was a bustle with energy after a recently ended football game (Meineke Car Care Bowl, or whatever the hell it's called now), the restaurant itself was virtually dead for dinner service on a Saturday night. This did give me a better chance to take in the surroundings, and notice the ornate chandelier (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385725507\/), along with a beautiful but non-functioning water display, and plates and silverware which seemed entirely too old-fashioned Southern elegant than necessary, including captain's chairs which didn't quite mesh with the tables. On the plus side, a virtually empty dining room caused service to be very attentive, and the food came out without delay.

The chef decided to start out with an amuse bouche of crab stuffed pastry (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4386490332\/) with a homemade remoulade sauce. It was interesting, because I honestly wasn't even expecting an amuse here, but it was a nice surprise. The remoulade was a bit weak (I tend to like a little more spice), but the crab was nice in texture and flavor. It didn't take me long after those 2 bites to dive right into the sweet cornbread biscuits, thanks to the very soft butter. The biscuits were delicious, and were it not for a huge food order coming, I could have easily downed a dozen right then.

The first real course of the night was a lobster ""cobbler"", prepared as an étouffée inside a phyllo tart (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385726467\/), with a side of saffron ice cream and topped with fresh chive. This was very close to my favorite dish of the night. The lobster flavor was fantastic, and although the saffron ice cream seemed strange at this point in the meal it really paired well with the strong flavors of the main component. The phyllo was perfectly flaky and taken as a whole bite just melts in your mouth. The next starter, braised beef short ribs served over gingerbread cookies (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4386491172\/) was a little more disappointing, but still decent. The sweetness of the cookies was too much, and didn't mix well with the soy in the beef glaze, but at least the meat was extremely tender.

The soup course was next, and both options were frankly somewhat forgettable. The butternut squash soup (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4386491456\/) was a bit bland, as it can often be, but usually chefs will do something the kick a little flavor in. Not so much here. But perhaps the biggest let down of the night was the pork belly stew (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385727231\/), which I had very high hopes for. It all became sort of a runny tomato mess, and the texture on the pork belly was very odd and somehow tough...almost like it had been in a freezer too long.

After an intermezzo of chilled citrus sorbet, which acted as a wonderful palate cleanser, the main courses got them back on the road to redemption, both delivering solid flavors. The Scottish salmon (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385727849\/) was a very large portion, and cooked perfectly, flaking apart very nicely. The one downside was a general lack of seasoning in the dish, but at least the fish seemed pretty fresh so those flavors were enough to carry it as a whole. The duo of duck (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385727613\/), while looking a bit sloppy, was easily the best dish of the night, and something worth returning to Savannah Red to taste again. The breast portion was seared nicely, and very juicy, and the sauce on top really helped bring out the flavors of the meat as well as adding a hint of sweetness. The confit part was huge, as I would prefer it to be, and just fell apart under the fork, a really well cooked piece of meat.

Since I've left Charlotte I'm a bit out of touch with the dining scene there, but it's nice to see good places like this still around, despite a very challenging location. Granted, most places would kill for the prime real estate downtown, but I have a feeling a lot of its presence is lost by the hotel towering above it, and a lobby that is completely distracting with all the other options. I love that they try to maintain some sense of Southern cuisine in their menu, and that every time I've checked the menu since dining there a year ago they are constantly updating it with new, fresh additions.),(Located off the lobby of the Marriott hotel, Savannah Red is a small restaurant (50 seats), brightly decorated, that has been dubbed the ""boldest food in Charlotte"" by the James Beard Foundation. 

I personally never got past the cute bar up front as it was Valentines Day weekend and we didn't have a reservation, but based on the special prix fixe menus that I saw, and the food coming out of the kitchen, it looked delicious! The menu is filled with southern treats with a modern twist. 

Staying at the small bar (6 upholstered chair stools, max) had it's own benefits. We got excellent service for a wide range of drinks and good conversation by the bartender, manager and server.. I loved that they were pouring champagne freely and the server, Tonya, was buoyant, personable and, as it turns out, a fellow Yelper! 

Next time I'm in Charlotte- you can bet I am going to eat here. I have to try out a menu that people described to me as amazing. If for no other reason than to be waited on by the amazing Tonya!),(Say it with me now - Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding. 

When I first told one of my friends about this dessert, he told me that the thought of it made him Krispy Kreme his pants. That's before I even went into the pornographic details about how it was swimming in Makers Mark Caramel Bourbon Sauce that was set ablaze. So naughty.

I mean, I don't even like donuts all that much but it just felt wrong not to order an item that was just so blatantly taunting. 

I kept my expectations at bay before dining here. It's located inside of the City Center Marriott so I was very aware that the food may be uninspiring and generic. But what I found is that Savannah Red is actually a fabulous restaurant that stands on it's own two feet, with delicious food at tasty price points
 
Things started off nicely with an amuse bouche of cauliflower soup, which was rich and delicious.

I like to just nibble and taste so I ordered a few small dishes. The Jumbo Crab Cakes ($8) were pretty good, but keep in mind that the Cilantro Avocado Emulsion is little a small dollop on the plate. The Diver Scallop Ravioli w\/ cream sauce, wilted greens, and Sriracha gastrique ($8) was my far my favorite dish ordered. You've got to try it. the greens are cooked perfectly and the two ravioli are large, fresh and meaty. 

I was given a bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate before being presented with my Pear and Endive salad, blue cheese brulee and pink apple vinaigrette. So good!

Initially, I had no plans on ordering dessert. But the bread pudding was only $6 and sounded so novel that I had to give it a try. If you like donuts, you will love it. For my own personal taste (I'm not huge on donuts) it was a bit too sweet, but the preparation and plating were fabulous!

Overall, an excellent restaurant with stellar service and an exciting menu.)"

With hundreds of reviews... what's really left to say? Let's do this the Nikki way.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, sugar craving, coffee run, middle of the night soup... this place does it all.

My personal favs: salted caramel brownies (I dream about them), chocolate croissant, spinach asparagus leek soup (all the soups are fantastic), mushroom tartine, turkey and brie sandwich. You really can't go wrong with anything here. 

Parking alert for Wednesdays: it's NoDa Run Club night so it's pretty insane in this area. I avoid it all costs.

Amelie's is one of the many reasons I miss living in NoDa. However, I think my waistline and wallet are happy I'm no longer just blocks from here.),(Amelie's. It's an absolute Charlotte staple, honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie, but some of the most apathetic service in town, in my opinion. I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere. 

When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24\/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy. 

The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter ""go out of their way"" to serve you and, dare I say, ask ""who's next"" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares. 

Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper. 

I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable.),(I had heard about this place for awhile now but had yet to make it out there...and boy oh boy I am so glad that I did I will definitely be coming again soon. 

Butter butter everywhere. I would trade chocolate any day for a baguette and butter. 

At Amelie's you don't have to trade in your chocolate but please dig your teeth into one of their classic french sandwiches like the croque monsieur and don't leave until you have a pastry... how about a chocolate croissant to go. I really wanted a taste of everything, since they're open 24 hours I probably could have done it. 

They also have a great espresso bar, I was really thirsty so I went with a lavender lemonade that was delicious and refreshing. 

Relax by yourself, or bring your friends. A very unique place and well worth every penny.

1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty\/sweet\/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.

2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! 

3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.

4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.

5) Free WiFi! Woot!

6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.

On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. 

Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.),(6\/8\/12

All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...

We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast\/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  

Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)

As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.

Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!

p.s.  Amelie's is open 24\/7!),(Amelie's is a small pastry shop that, according to my good friend that lives in Charlotte, has become incredibly popular since they expanded their hours to 24\/7 (whenever that was).  As soon as we stepped through the doors tonight, it was apparent.  The line to the cash registers extended past the entire glass casing of pastries and almost into the next room.

The bakery has an extensive selection of unique and freshly made pastries.  There are so many good looking treats to choose from, it makes deciding what to order difficult.  Fortunately, the employees are more than willing to help and describe the various sweets they offer.  I also noticed on the menu board that they serve breakfast foods, soups, sandwiches, and of course, coffees and teas.  I tried their popular salty caramel brownie.  It was thick, salty, sweet, sticky, and rich.  I could feel the cavities forming in my teeth as I chewed each bite.

The design and decor of this place is original and ""artsy.""  There are a lot of handmade decorations, including the chandeliers.  The seating is comfortable and cozy and some of the restaurant looks more like a living room than a bakery with couches, coffee tables, lamps, and bookshelves.  Almost every seat was taken when we went, even in the atrium in the back.  The crowd was very diverse.  Live music was going on in one of the rooms.),(They just got bumped to 5 star status after my last visit.....


So the scene is an early Saturday morning.....and another Bank conversion is in play for me.  

As I hate for my team to have to work on the weekends, I was on point to pick up breakfast and Amelies was one of the few places open on a Saturday morning (as I had already done the Einstein's\/Bruggers the last event).

I walked in an immediately filled an order for over 60 pastries.  They completed my order without blinking an eye.  Boxed and bagged up, I thanked them and was on my way........it may be a hipster hangout, but these folks are nothing but professional....plus their stuff tastes great!),(There are so many reasons I love Amelie's. First of all of course the food is amazing!  They have a wide range of French pastries and the variety is mind boggling. There is definitely something for everyone.  My favorites being the palmier and the raspberry fruit tie. They also have incredible tarts, eclairs, petit fours, mini cakes or gateaux, brownies, macaroons, etc.  Then there are the savory treats.  They seem to be most proud of their soups like the spinach asparagus leek and sweet potato bisque.  While the soup is pretty great and my favorite thing on a rainy or cold day I am in love with the baguette and croissant sandwhiches.  You can get them with ham or jambon, eggs, spinach, tomato, or cheese or any combination.  My favorite cheeses being a tie between brie and gueyere.  There is some outside seating but the inside is a virtual modern french salon with very chic and creative decor.  Amelie's has more than one location now, but the orginal on North Davidson is my favorite and it's open TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY!  I havn't even gotten a chance to mention free Wi Fi, lavander infused sparkling lemonade, and flourless chocolate cake so you will have to just go yourself and make your own discoveries!),(Why does Charlotte love Amélie'? because...obviously..
1) This one is around the clock 24\/7.
2) The roast beef on a croissant is over-the-top.
3) Everyone raves about the salted caramel brownie. My next visit mission to find out why this brownie gained such prominence.

Four and Half Yelps.),(This is the way a bakery should be.
Family owned and family feel.
You are treated with smells of good old fashioned home made treats.

With beautiful decor from renaissance to Victorian, this is a unique environment.  With free Wi-Fi and great hours (All day and night), this is a treat and truly a model for bakeries everywhere.

Trying new items, you can expect a new surprise each time.

From sandwiches to multi-cultural desserts, you will not be disappointed when you go to this establishment.

Be prepared.  It is fun and delicious.),(Oh my god this is one of the best bakeries I've ever been to. I lived in Charlotte for a whole 6 months and this was a frequent stop. It's in a little industrial plaza so if you are not looking you will definitely miss it. When I walked in, I was surprised at how big the place was. The ambiance is truly one of a kind, think of old french quarters. The employees are great. My first time here one of the staff members was with me for about 10 minutes giving recommendations. 
The rumors are true: you MUST get the salted brownie. I also got a chocolate croissant too..... One word: amazing! If you are ever planning a trip to Charlotte or in the mood for something new, you MUST come to Amelie's. You definitely will not regret it!),(I might just move into Amelie's -- and I could probably totally get away with it since I hear they are a 24-hour biz. And if they didn't mind me camping in a corner with my laptop and washing my hair in their bathroom sink and receiving mail there, this relocation could be viable on both sides.

I mean, I love coffee. And I love homemade dessert. So they would have quite the perma-customer. All in exchange for allowing a drifter to indulge in their cute and quirky space: striped walls, hip chandeliers, arty black & white photography.

In other words, lurved it. Enjoyed my ice latte too. But unfortunately, the coffee torte left a little something to be desired -- evidenced by the fact that I left mine only 2\/3 finished. UNHEARD of when it comes to dessert. However, I'm not holding it too much against them since they have a display case FULL of tempting goodies... many of which I'm sure will become staple meals of mine once I move in.),(My only complaint about my visit to Amelie's was the line! Luckily though they worked through it pretty quickly. A lot of people mention the seating but, when I was there on a Friday night it was getting pretty aggressive with people trying to secure a spot.

The pastries were great, and well I eat a lot of pastries so I like to consider myself a semi-expert. Luckily just as we were about to close up our box they put out a new tray of macarons one of the trays held a cinnamon chocolate one that I immediately snatched up and it was delicious. Some of the other highlights were the salted caramel brownie, pistachio macaron, and this raspberry cake square.  

I do agree with others that the service isn't exactly something to rave about here. But, it didn't really bother me. I wanted the line to move fast and to get the pastries I wanted and the service did enable that for me.),(I absolutely adore this place! This may be my favorite coffee shop in the entire U.S. The food was delicious and the coffee was pretty good. The vibe and ambience however is amazing. It borders between kitsch and eclectically cute. I could spend all day here--there are so many amazing little nooks to discover.),(Great selection of French baked goods

Had the Cream Puff and Fruit Tart. Some of the best cream ever. This stuff was delicious and went everywhere. 

They have a lot of tea and coffee options. Really wanted to get a coffee but it was late in the day and I didn't want to jeopardize my beauty sleep.)"

Yes, they have plain old boring cheeseburgers, but they also offer a broad variety of toppings to satisfy the taste buds of every carnivore - mushrooms, guacamole, cheese (american or cheddar), BBQ style, even one they call ""The Royale"" which comes with bacon, cheese and a fried egg.

Fries are the thinner shoestring variety and they're not terribly greasy and are surprisingly not oversalted.

Service is hit or miss. I've heard horror stories of rude staff. Today, my waitress was just so good that I not only mentioned it to the manager, I called their customer ""complaint"" line and told them how great she was.

Steak n' Shake is open 24 hours. They have a sign on the door today that they're open on Thanksgiving Day, so perhaps if you burn the turkey and mush the mashed potatoes, you can come here instead.

Warning! The parking lot is very clearly marked as for SnS guests only. If the Lynx lot is full, you do NOT want to park here.),(Ok, so not many people in their right mind should expect anything from a greasy spoon like Steak and Shake. 

If you're walking in the front doors and expecting a 5-star meal, you might as well expect the same from one of the larger fast food chains in this great country. 

If you choose to experience Steak and Shake, do so on a very empty stomach and then expect to take heartburn medicine and a nap. 

Heavy, greasy, fatty and devoid of a healthy option. Again, quite expected. You might as well just walk in knowing that you're going to have to loosen your belt. 

With that being said, you have to get a burger, dog, patty melt, whatever with fries. Their fries are so skinny and light. Not overdone like so many other places. 

Also, you have to get a milkshake. What kind of experience would you be having at a truckstop-esque diner without a milkshake? Shame on you if you forego this option!

Look forward to leaving full, disgusted with yourself and ready for a small hibernation!),(It was that weird time of day around 3p, where I haven't eaten yet, but I didn't want to eat too much because of dinner. So I thought I would get a hot dog. I went to Steak and Shake, I saw that they had a combo, Chicago style hot dog, french fries and drink for $5. You can't beat that price. So I ordered, it's #16- if you need to get a quick fix. 

It was definitely good, they cut the hot dog in half longways, grill it on the flat top, top it with all the appropriate fixin's for a Chicago dog. My french fries were hot, but shoestring french fries get cold really fast, so they had already been under the heat lamp a few minutes, then by the couple of minutes to park the car- not the best. So my french fry barometer registered a ""a nice tone of meh"" 

The hot dog bun was too large and poofy, so way too much bread and it was sopping wet from pickle juice, so soggy bread is a turn off, and I don't mean damp either. it was smushed wet like a sponge. Yeah, smushed. Also it wasn't a poppy seed bun for the sticklers. Oh, and another thing, they grilled the bun, that was a nice touch.. My hot dog was made with care, not slapped together.. 

So, this being said, for five bucks and a quick dog, yes I will return.)"

Sandwiches, soups and salads are their specialties, as well as a large offering of baked goods. Cookies, bagels, muffins and whole loaves of bread are all made fresh in the store every day.

The ""pick two"" deal is two of either a half sandwich a bowl of soup or a salad, and they have an excellent selection of all. The soups rotate on a daily basis, so it's different every day.

I usually stop here to pick up breakfast on the way to work and the store is busy. Expect to wait a few minutes for your order to be taken as they are busy. The bagels are very good quality and very fresh. The ""everything"" bagel has plenty of sesame and poppy seeds plus garlic, onion and salt. I'd recommend that you ask them to toast it to give it the right flavor and go with the sun dried tomato cream cheese. They have a ""baker's dozen"" special with 13 bagels and two packets of cream cheese.

The coffee urn choices are light, bold, hazelnut or decaf and at this location, they put a note on it with the time the coffee was prepared. Skim milk and half and half are offered with the usual selection of white, pink blue and yellow packets of sweetener. Pepsi product as well as iced tea.),(It's a Panera. Y'all know the broccoli cheese soup is tasty, the cinnamon crunch bagels are insanely good and the sandwiches, albeit moderately sized, are typically pretty bad for you. Just sayin'....

Nonetheless, if I'm in SouthPark and need to drop in for a bevvie and plow through a bit of work, this location suits me just fine. The employees are really sweet and they pretty much leave you alone if you're working away...

Other pertinent info...

The parking: Can get pretty stacked in the little lot shared by Panera, AT&T, etc. Park carefully. 

The space: Plenty of tables, booths and whatnot to saddle up and get through some work. You can score free WiFi through Panera, or you can likely latch on to AT&T's WiFi too.),(I'm a fan of Panera. I like that I can find something here for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The options are relatively healthy, but you can always find something a little unhealthy too. 

You can pick two. A combination of sandwich and\/or soup and\/or salad. pick two. good stuff. Great selection of sandwiches, panini's and soups. 

They also have fresh baked goods, bagels, espresso drinks, fresh teas and fruit smoothies. 

Prices are pretty reasonable and if you have a panera card you can get free pastries\/cookies or drinks after a certain number of purchases. 

this location is cool. it gets busy and parking can be rough at times, but the staff is good and i've never had an issue. 

I like coming here. it's a good place.),(Honestly, if you've been to one Panera bread you have been to every Panera bread.  What kind of irks me is they have become the de facto place for business meetings.  With the cleanliness of the place (which is always on point) and the free wi-if, I can see why.  

But what I truly love about this place, is there scones!  It's true... Their scones, buttery, crumbly and flavorful.  Cinnamon is probably my favorite.  They are four dollars yes, but they are happiness, delight and deliciousness all rolled together. Panera also has really delicious flavored coffee and ice coffees.

Where they dropped the ball in their beverage offerings, are their fountain drinks. I can appreciate them trying to educate consumers on how much sugar is in the drink (it is printed on the side of the cup) but it is awful that they don't put any sugar in your drink if you want it.  In fairness they did  have the packets of sugar which take too long to dissolve.
On the two days I went there, the sugar pumps they provide for those who want sweetened drinks were empty.  So basically they charge you upwards of three dollars for what tastes like unsweetened Kool-Aid with giant sugar crystals sitting at the bottom.

I don't care about their food menu.  It is like upgraded hospital food.  Not bad enough to complain, but not good enough to rave over either.  I mean they try.  The other day I think I tasted some sweet potato spread on my dry turkey sandwich.  So there is that!

I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from.

This place is amazing. They've got it all! 
The beer selection here is quite impressive. They specialize in hard to find beers, with a section for sour beers, IPAs, and seasonals. They have a small bar, where you can get a beer on tap, and drink it there, or out on their nice patio. 
They also sell wine! They've got a wine expert on site to help you with your selections. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about their beers as well. Since I was an out-of-towner, they were able to steer me to the best local beers, made just down the street. 
The store also sells weird knickknacks and strange toys, like pigeon masks, or red fuzzy fezes.  
The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. They made the visit quite enjoyable. 
In the back, they have a deli with a wide variety of sandwiches, and a vending machine that sells musical accessories, like drum sticks and guitar strings. 
The place isn't exactly clean, but I get the feeling that they're going for a dive vibe, which is certainly working for this place. 
The patio is nice and large, with outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. They allow you to bring your beer purchased inside out onto the patio and drink it right there. This is something I'm not accustomed to, but I really enjoyed the experience!

The Quattro is super cheesy, as you expect, and the combination of cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gouda and goat) are delicious topped with sun-dried tomatoes. The Artichoke 'za is a bit more healthy and one I normally choose - marinated artichokes, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, basil pesto and mozzarella. Yum. 

I wouldn't recommend getting wheat crust, as it was a little too dry and cardboard-y to me. The traditional is the way to go, my friends. Also, keep an eye out for restaurant coupons, etc. for Brixx.

Panera is a great place to get to when you want to drink coffee (free refills!) while you suck down some internet and maybe try to get some work done. Quite a lot of tables, many of which do have a power outlet nearby.

The ""pick two"" is the best way to get a variety of flavors and textures for your meal. Choice of a smaller salad, a reasonable bowl of soup and a half of one of their signature sandwiches. But for breakfast, I prefer the toasted everything bagel (you may want to ask them to put it through twice) with cream cheese is a good meal. Especially since the coffee is refillable.

During the busy lunch times (11 to 1), the wifi will cut out after a half hour. This is your cue to start tethering your phone. Though if the place is filling up, it's not polite to take up a table and not be eating. Give folks a chance.

I enjoy smoking hookah, so my homies and I came to Crave on a Wednesday night after dinner.  For a Wednesday night, you'd think it be dead inside, but it actually wasn't too bad.

Our waitress Alina and her first-day trainee were super sweet and accomodating to our table, which could at times, be demanding since we had a bunch of boys who love to drink and some hookah snobs.  They were patient, friendly, and helpful throughout the entire evening.

We got 3 hookahs - watermelon mint, grape mint, and grape apple mint.  I recommend getting a fruit bowl and an ice hose.  Each of their towers only has 1 hose.  The latter of the 3 flavors we got were the best - anything with mint is pretty much the way to go.  Pretty standard hookah here.

Crave also serves dessert, but after the large dinner I'd just had, I wasn't really interested in any of that.

Crave is a solid place to hang out with friends for a few sweet bites and some decent hookah.  Wish I would have come here more often when I was down there!),(This place is where I go when I want to get my sweet tooth satisfied....be it in liquid or solid form.

- If you are a shisha smoker, you wouldn't enjoy theirs. They serve organic hookah tobacco, it won't do the trick.

I opted for the huevos rancheros and it was different than others I've had. More like an omelet with grilled chicken, black beans and pepper jack cheese, but topped with pico and sour cream. That's not what I was expecting but it was still very good.

My wife chose the frittata style eggs and didn't enjoy it much. She said that the eggs, with the melted cheddar cheese and the pork sausage, had the texture of shoes. Well, that was a bummer. But the biscuit was good with their table jam on it.

But with that said, we both thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato hash.

Zada's is definitely a staple that deserves to be on everyone's breakfast shortlist. Find it odd that I've yet to write a review until now. 

Here's the gist: If it's cold or raining, sit inside. If the wait is monstrous, I typically won't stick it out. If it's sunny outside, do yourself a favor and grab table on the patio. If the wait it horrifically long in general and you have to have your Bunny Rancheros fix, take a spot in line and play a few games of shuffleboard. 

Pretty sure I get the Bunny Rancheros every time with wheat toast slathered with apple butter. The local chorizo isn't half bad either. 

I'm a fan, it's great in a pinch, I like to pretend I'm good at shuffleboard, and I'd definitely take firstmeal at Zada's happen in a pinch.

Anywho, I love the feel of Zada Janes. Yeah, the parking can be a bit irritating, especially on the weekends, but the location is perfect for sauntering around the area. Inside ZJ is bright, cheery and quirky - a great fit for the location. The menu is inspired and offers up a ton of egg-y options for breakfast, but I'm personally more of a carbo-loaded sweet fan for my morning meal. I know, healthy.

But I stayed away from their pancakes and french toast to try out the Zada Janer - a simple, straight forward breakfast with eggs your style (my choice: scrambled), a protein (my choice: turkey bacon), a carb (my choice: fruit cup), and toast. The meal was just fine but nothing to write home about. My eggs were a little dry - maybe I'll ask for some cheesy scramblies next time? The fruit cup was generous and fresh and the turkey bacon was just so-so. For $8 this was plenty of food for me, but I can see how it could be perceived as a bit steep for bigger appetites. 

I want to love Zada Janes as the service is laid back and friendly and it's so cute and homey inside, but for now I just like it. I am, however, a big fan that they support local ingredients and neighborhood events. Next time I'm going to rely on the knowledgeable servers and go for the good stuff.),(Had my sis, who is a local resident, take Mom, my nephew, and me here for our last meal in Charlotte on 4\/28.

These pancakes were tasty, albeit very greasy, a fact that wasn't evident until I unwrapped some leftovers to have on the plane a few hours later, which ended up in the garbage.  I really enjoyed the side of sweet potato hash- a tasty alternative to regular potatoes, which I am not able to consume anymore these days.

Overall, we enjoyed the food, but not the wait.),(Zada Janes....a nice brunch place that has a funky feel to it......now some folks want to equate that to Asheville....my hometown, but I think the place is just a good idea...not ""Asheville"".....

If you want to eat without a wait either go early or way past 12 noon, then getting a table it won't be an issue.

The menu has a good selection of both meat and vegan dishes.  Pricing is about a dollar or so more than what I would call ""non-funky"" places.

My last dish was the Belvedere Omelets.  The eggs were great, but the potatoes were cool..barely warm, so 50\/50 experience.

Staff is good, but not great with service, but due to the popularity, they are more about moving the people and dishes through rather than giving good service, which isn't a ""ding"" on them.

Parking in back is always full, so street parking is really and ususally the only option.

Zada Jane's Corner is my pick for a relaxed Sunday brunch. While they have large outdoor area for when it is nice (isn't it always nice in Charlotte?!) they also have large indoor restaurant. 
My friend got the hummus frummus salad, and I had the Blazing saddles. We opted for the coffee and we both left satisfied. However, If you like, you can treat yourself to mimosa or a manly man-mosa.

I've been here probably 30 times in the last six months, usually on Tuesday night when they have their ""buy a dozen, get a dozen free"" special. (It's also good on the ""buy 8, get 8 free""!) Clue: the specials are not available to go, but you can have them delivered to your table and immediately ask for a box. Beer specials are usually a choice of one or two different bottled beers for a discount and maybe a special draft. Tuesday has been $2.50 Corona\/Corona Light night for at least six months.

The wings are very good. Meaty and well cooked with enough sauce (choose from 33 different sauces from ""virgin"" all the way up to ""Braveheart""). ""Boss"" is my favorite. They recently introduced a new menu with more pub grub items like quesadillas and different burgers, even ribs. Trust me, you want to stick to the wings.

As said elsewhere, parking is a bit of a pain if you get there during peak hours. Don't park in front of the nail salon or the dry cleaners when they're open - they will tow you quickly. There's a lot across the street. And yes, the bathrooms can sometimes get a little out of hand. This is one of those times it's good to be a dude. ;-)

Every so often, they have a live band. Sometimes they're pretty good. Most of the time, however, they are entirely too loud. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I am here to hang out with friends and eat chicken and drink beer. Not shout at them. It was so overpoweringly loud once, I had to write my order on a napkin for the waitress. Maybe the management will get a clue and notice how the place empties out when the noise begins.)"

Spoiler alert: I can't eat four rolls by myself. I gave it my best shot though. 

My latest trip here was for take out grub. I walked in after yoga. Hot mess express over here. I posted up at the bar, ordered myself a glass of Prosecco and dove into the overwhelming menu. 

My selections: Spicy spider, Spiral Ecstasy, Watermelon, and Cherry Blossom rolls. The Spicy spider and Spiral Ecstasy were the winners. I love rolls wrapped in cucumber instead of rice. Unfortunately, the cucumber didn't look all that appealing for the Watermelon.

Four rolls + one glass of Prosecco = $38. I could've easily been okay with just two rolls. 

The bartender was super friendly and attentive. He helped me go through the endless list of options. Call it the never-ending menu. I would gladly sit at the bar any time he was working for a meal.

Akahana is a decent little sushi spot. Nothing too fancy. Rolls aren't super creative. Great specials throughout the week. Worth a trip if you're craving sushi in the Plaza Midwood 'hood.),(Where Akahana isn't an incredible location based on locale, they definitely pack a punch with a sushi menu of note. Checked these guys out for lunch after a long awaited and needed visit. 

The decor is actually pretty swanky. I really like the waterfall with the glass logo behind it. Pretty snazzy. Cool bar setup, too. 

We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi\/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter. 

My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck. Jerry springer and other garbage channels on all of them and the sushi chefs were glued to it. Kind of funny, but really disappointing. Daytime TV + sushi = no thanks. 

I can say I'd be back, but maybe for a change from the regular sushi go-tos. Cheers!),(BOGO yay! I've only stopped in for lunch - BOGO for lunch is a good deal well it's a good deal for dinner too  -but it's almost too much food for lunch.  The menu is huge and there are plenty of rolls to choose from for BOGO.  My rolls we're delicious - it's a little pricey but I was really pleased with all the options on the menu and the ambiance was awesome.),(It's taken me a while to finally get this review down...and I think it's because I really want to love Akahana but, overall, I just kinda like it. The interior is pretty slick, the menu a large Asian compilation, the staff was friendly and efficient but overall, the food was what held back this review from a 4 star. This ambivalence has delayed my review, but here we go. 

BOGO sushi every night now. Yup. Every night. While this is pretty great (as our bill for four rolls and an appetizer was under $40) it's also a little worrisome. Did Akahana jack up the prices of all the sushi to accommodate this special? Or, instead, are they serving smaller or fish of a lesser quality? Well, while the portions were ample, the sushi tasted fine, but not great. Here's the run down. 

Asian Summer Roll: 4\/5: A fresh, nicely stuffed shrimp Vietnamese inspired spring roll with a thick dipping sauce. Go easy on the sauce.  

Spicy Tuna: 3\/5: The spicy tuna, while it tasted fine, was strangely very, very red. Like atomic red. Kudos for not slathering the tuna in mayonnaise, but the bright red color frightened me.

Crunchy Tuna Roll: 2\/5: Too heavily fried for my tastes and again with the fire engine red tuna? 

Cherry Blossom Roll: 4\/5: Fresh, tasty and delicious. I would go back just for this roll. 

Mt. Fuji Roll: 3\/5: A little too sweet  - if I recall correctly it was topped with mango and a too much sweet sauce. Could be delightful if it was suaceless. 

I may head back to Akahana for lunch or to pick up some sushi to go...it's definitely worth another try, if not just for BOGO!)"

1) You're able to designate which fruits\/veggies you don't like, so they try to avoid sending you those.

Since they deliver produce year round, not all of the items are locally grown. i.e. Can't get bananas or oranges from NC in December.

Lebowski's has a ton of daily specials. Lunch, dinner, drinks. They even do a twice a day happy hour. On Wednesdays, wings are half price all day.

six wings, one slider, and fries for $11.95. The garlic fries are delicious.

Had the charbroiled taste...excellent.),(Determined to shake up our Saturday lunch routine, hubs and I stopped by Lebowski's to try their famous wings and take in a bit of college football in the mean time. 

The first impression is a bit nondescript - Lebowski's looks like many other sports bars in Charlotte and has a nice little patio facing East Blvd. Because Mother Nature gave us a break from the 90s, we chose to sit outside and enjoy a relaxing lunch (hubs was especially happy as there are TVs outside, too!). Both the hostess and our server weren't the cheeriest of individuals...it seemed like they both had a long night out. Regardless, hubs went with the Carolina Gold wings and the Beef on Weck, I choose a side salad and the small version of the Chili & Mac 'n Cheese. 

Upon ordering our server informs us that the wings take about 15-20 minutes to cook. Um...ok...that's a little odd, but we would still like them. This was noon on a Saturday in a not-so-busy restaurants. Now, I'm not a wing eater but even hubs said that that's a long time to wait for six wings. So, basically the entire time we were joking with each other that the cook had to go fetch the chickens and take care of them so he could have his wings in less than 20 minutes. 

And yes, it did take 20 minutes for these wings to reach our table. I'll let hubs review his own food. As for mine...the salad was fresh but not too much to report. Their side salad included bits of iceberg and romaine, a flat crostini and a few other veggies. 

As for my Chili Mac 'n Cheese, it was pretty tasty albeit the chili was a bit sweet. I had a different expectation...when I saw a cup of chili mac 'n cheese I expected a cup of chili with a bit of mac 'n cheese at the bottom. I was a bit suprised when I saw a flat dish of mac 'n cheese with a small scoop of chili on top. No worries, though, I ate it up - it was a nice little serving. 

Will I be back to Lebowski's? Sure...for a few beers and maybe a snack, but I don't think it's going to make it into my trusty lunch spot list.),(Been here several times and my wife even more and I can't believe I have not gotten around to writing a review till today.

It's a great place with a western NY twist on things. Server told us the owner was from Buffalo which explains all of the Buffalo Bills flags and Western NY School pennants.

We drove down right after Church. We were originally looking for another restaurant and we could not find it, decided to go with what we knew was good.

Walked in about 11:30 and basically had the place to ourselves but that changed quickly.

Our server was very attentive. My wife ordered Unsweet tea which I questioned how sweet the sweet tea was. She brought me a sample and it was too sweet so she ended up mixing it half and half.and she did that throughout the lunch.

My wife order the Smothered Chicken which she has ordered before and she liked it.  I had the Fredonia.  Starts out as a French Dip but time you put it on a Weck Rolls with Caraway Seeds and horseradish it's closer to a kimmelweck which make since considering the Buffalo Connection.

Excellent choice since that is one of my favorites.

I actually glad we could not find that restaurant because lunch today was great and I finally got a changed to write a review of it.)"

I haven't had Bojangles since the early-mid 1990s when I was on vacation in the South.  Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.

Connecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA, I knew I was going to stop at Bojangles to give their chicken a try (this Bojangles is located in Concourse B of the US Airways terminal).  Bojangles may be fast food and a chain, but at least it is a regional chain and provides something different than other nearby airport eateries such as Burger King, Chili's, Quizno's, and KFC.

There is a sign posted that says the food gets out within minutes of ordering (to capitalize on those commuters who have to get-it-quick-and-go).  They delivered on their promise because the food came out really quick (less than a minute).  Service was also friendly and efficient.  They also seemed well-staffed to handle peak times.  It looked like many travelers were choosing Bojangles for their layover dining destination.

Their individual meals were not in the $5 range, but they were under $10 (which is not bad considering that airport food is often overpriced).  Family meals were also available.  I had three pieces of chicken (2 thighs and a leg) with one side (mashed potatoes and gravy) and a biscuit.

The chicken was quite crispy on the outside.  Often, fried chicken at fast food places can be overly fatty or skimpy on the meat, but there was a good portion of chicken meat on the thighs.  The dark meat had the appropriate amount of fat, but it was not too fatty.  The chicken was also juicy.

Unfortunately, the chicken was a little bit bland and I was expecting more kick.  Popeyes has a nice spiciness to their chicken, but Bojangles' chicken (on the other hand) could have used a little more heat and seasoning.  Honey and hot sauce were available, which helped give the chicken more flavor.  There was some greasiness to the chicken, but it was fried chicken after all (that is kind of a given).

The mashed potatoes were similar to the mashed potatoes you would find at KFC.  Same taste with that signature texture that can only be described as not real-mashed-potato-like.  The gravy at Bojangles had a little more flavor than KFC.  I'm fine with KFC mashed potatoes so I thought this side was okay.

The biscuit was large and had a nice, crunchy golden brown top.  Unfortunately, the biscuit was quite dry.

Airport food is often average quality, overpriced and the same everywhere.  I still can't figure out how there seem to be Cinnabons at most of the country's airports when they are so hard to find elsewhere.   Since Bojangles is a regional chain, I think it would definitely be worth trying if you are a fan of fried chicken and have some time to kill at the Charlotte Airport.

(Irrelevant Note) I sat next to NFL QB Jimmy Clausen on the airplane back to LA and I was surprised that there were not many people in Charlotte who recognized him--especially considering that he was the Carolina Panthers' top draft pick just a few weeks ago.)"

As for the brew, wow! That's some excellent coffee! Possibly one of the best cups I've had since returning to the US. Rich, smooth, tasty!

Overhead tunes from one of the local radio stations blocked out the clicking of keyboards and the hum of the cooler, interrupted every so often by the bell on the door.),(Ahh to see Dilworth Coffee still standing in this space is a healthy dose of the days of yore. Well, maybe circa 2-3 years ago. I used to be a frequent customer of many Dilworth locations around town and I'm happy to live in close proximity to this location. 

This was a fortuitous location for my previous years' work and I would spend many hours crunching out tasks sitting at the bar. It's nice to see that this location has received a nice facelift on the interior and, boy, does it look nice. Not nearly as cluttered, updated furniture, open, and easier access to power outlets. I see many a workday happening here yet again!

I picked up a pound of coffee this week and was a little shocked by the price. I buy an unground lb of Papua New Guinea from a few other places in town for easily $5 cheaper. It's not a huge deal, nor is it a dealbreaker, but just a little shocking. The lady at the counter told me that ownership of the shop had recently changed and updated some pricing. Their coffee lineup and selection is rather clean and easy to choose from, too. They use a roaster based out of Raleigh now. Can't remember the name...

Also, great cold press iced coffee. They actually use an espresso blend that is really smooth for their cold press. Big fan.),(I'm an addict...there are many things that I love including  food, dirty martini's, my family, my dogs, my boyfriend but I could not survive one day without my coffee.

I don't actually ever order my coffee like that but I do see other customers do and Dilworth is happy to accomodate.

I have recently had cravings for their vanilla chai...it is so good and creamy the mix they use is the best I've ever had.  What also makes this place rock is its fast... if your in a rush just grab a cup of joe pour yourself some coffee (their coffee is in front of the counter) and if there is a line and you have exact change leave it on the counter and you will not be late for work...I will make the extra drive to Dilworth even though I might have to pass a starbucks on the way.),(Oh Dilworth Coffee House, please, please don't judge me. I've cheated on you with the Starbucks down the street a time or two and I'm truly, truly sorry. I can't promise I won't stroll over to the green awning giant again, but I can promise that I'll visit you more often. 

Dilworth Coffee House encompass all the wonderful things of a local coffee shop. The coffee itself is super tasty. The shop offers its patrons a nice variety of self-serve, extra large thermoses and plenty of add-in options. Think skim milk, soy milk, simple syrup, all kinds of sugar and half and half. Oh - and these are free of charge.

The coffee prices are certainly less than chains overall and I'm almost certain that Dilworth Coffee offers refills for $.75 each for the first refill and free thereafter. While there isn't much available here in the snack department, they do play to their strengths by providing an awesome supply of whole bean coffee. Nice!

The staff here are very friendly and definitely put tons 'o love into their coffee creations. The place itself is very kitschy, cozy and inviting, with a small array of tables of varying sizes and free WiFi. You can't get that at the 'Bucks. Echoing Faith D.'s sentiments, though, this location is certainly cozy (read: small) so don't expect to layout a world map and pretend to play Christopher Columbus as there just isn't the space.

I'm betting you'll indulge in a cup or two while you're there.),(Support local....that is what I think when I think of this place, but the folks in there are just not engaging...nor seem very friendly?

Great service, not too busy when we stopped in, and excellent food. All we need now is better parking!),(Pretty much the bread and butter date night or sweet tooth du jour of NoDa. You really can't go wrong at Crepe Cellar. 

The crepes are made with buckwheat, so you may be in for a bit of a surprise at first bite. A a little more chewy, earthy, and malty than your mom's crepes. Definitely better for the savory variety. 

One of the strengths of Crepe Cellar is their offering of savory and sweet crepes. You definitely need to try the Queen City savory. Wonderful flavors. Can't believe how much it made me love chicken, mushrooms and spinach together. Who knew all it took was a buckwheat crepe? The oven-roasted tomato dressing goes good on ANYTHING. Definitely the center stage act of this dish. 

When it comes to sweet, just try anything. You won't be unhappy. Especially with a piping hot brownie, ice cream and accompanying a warm, fresh crepe. Come on, America. France is right on this one. 

Lastly, alcohol. I love that they have so many good beers. Both both bottle and draught. Lots to choose from. Or, if you're a redneck like me, PBR is pretty cheap here. Hell yes. If you're of the classier alcohol mantra, definitely go for the Cellar Cider. Wonderful little concoction. Baron Jager and a few other spirits. Definitely worth the dough. 

Limited seating here, folks. Make sure you get here at a decent hour or put your name in and walk the streets of NoDa. Typically an hour wait or so on busy nights.

I am pretty sure I have had real crepes before and they were not supposed to be mushy and thick.  It's supposed to be thin, light, and crisp.  I loved the drink menu; lots of great wines, beers, ciders, etc. and at reasonable prices.  I am actually more intrigued by their soups and appetizers.  A really delicous looking salad came out while I was picking over my dough ball pillow crepe with ham tucked somewhere inside.

I work a 9-5er in uptown (no I'm not calling it ""the city"" or ""city""...Charlotte is more small town than big city to me.....even with a few skyscrapers...well, two that truly can scrape the sky so-to-speak....Sorry, I digress.

So I bumped into an old manager from my NationsBank days....yes, I'm also dating myself as does any banker that talks about banks they worked for and names you probably never even heard of....and we decided to do lunch at Jason.  This was a salad day for me...lots of meeting, so a big meal wasn't in the cards, unless I planned on falling half asleep in a meeting lasting hours and hours.  So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!

I had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup\/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...""convicted....no.......never convicted"" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.

The salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out.
The place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).

Fast....but only if you go the salad route....avg pricing, though $9 for lunch is not cheap if you eat out lunch every day.  All and all a generally good...can be quick depending....lunch spot in the center of town.),(This was my first time at a Jason's Deli and I am a fan.  I had lunch there twice actually.  The first time I just had the salad bar, which was very good.  The second time I had a reuben sandwich and it was amazing.  They have something here for everyone and the place was clean and the staff was friendly.  To top it off they have free soft serve ice cream :o))"

The shrimp was delicious. Spicy and flavorful. A great dish. 4 stars. The side of hummus was actually a full appetizer version, and at full appetizer cost. It was quite meh. And the bread wasn't particularly good either. 2 stars.

The service was kinda meh too. I appreciated their willingness to work with our large group. However, it was a rather long wait to get seated - even though the restaurant was almost entirely empty. And our assigned server seemed particularly unable to handle a large group. Each time he took an order, he took it from just one side of the table, went away, and then returned about 10 minutes later to take the other sides. We were a group of 12, not 25 - so that seemed entirely unnecessary. And, of course, it resulted in our food arriving at drastically different times. And don't even get me started on the process of getting and paying our check... 2 stars.

Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping\/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper. 

All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!

When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.

For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.

On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.

On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.

Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.

Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu.),(First off I've been to Sullivan's a hundred times in Raleigh and a couple times at this location in Charlotte.  I don't know what it is but I guess I just pick the worst nights to come here.   The first time they told me it would be a 45 min wait and I waited 2 hours before I was seated just to find out they were basically out of everything on the menu.  I actually banned coming back until I was invited here for a Christmas dinner this year.  I know this is a very busy time a year in the restaurant business but when you pay this much for food - I expect 

1.)  Appetizers to not take 45 min to come out & be cold
2.) Waiter to not throw away our leftovers after we have asked for a box
3.) When the man at the table already seems annoyed by your service and then you persist on throwing the dessert menu in his face (let's just say not a good move on your part) *he is paying the bill

It sucks because I really like Sullivans steak and in Raleigh I have always been happy with my food and service.),(Sullivan's I like you. I think we'll always be friends with benefits and maybe even date, but I don't want to marry you and commit to you and only you for the rest of my life. There are just other steakhouses that mean a whole lot to me. I hope you understand.

Sullivan's is like a good friend to me - consistent, present and convenient. The steak and sides have always been solid and the patio is perfection on a warm spring evening. The staff is typically friendly and efficient - even when things get pretty hairy on a Thursday or Sunday evening when the major specials are available. Which leads me to those specials...as Todd W mentioned - Thursday offers $5 Knockout martinis and bar bites while Sunday typically offers a $30 per person three course meal. The Knockout martini is my jam, friends. This pineapple-y, vodka with a touch of orange concoction is my personal nectar from the gods. Get one or four...and find a designated driver. 

The dining room is much quieter so if you're looking for a romantic or focused business evening, make a reservation. I fully appreciate Sullivan's consistency and the South End location doesn't disappoint. Thanks, friend.),(The food was excellent as usual at Sullivan's. The filet medallions were great and the bone in ribeye excellent. The banana foster bread pudding was the perfect dessert. Alex our server was very attentive.

The caesar salad was a big miss. A platter of romaine lettuce topped with croutons that did not seem handmade and then shredded mozzarella cheese?

The main course was great. My wife opted for the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and the mushrooms and sauce were flavorful and rich. The marinara sauce on the pasta was a little sweet and heavy with basil.

I chose the Chicken Gorgonzola. The sauce was very rich and very cheesy. Lots of mushrooms in there. Where my wife's chicken was tender, mine was a little rubbery and tough. Not enough to send back, but enough that it took some effort to cut with the steak knife. Since hers was perfect, I'm thinking that mine was just an off one.

For dessert, we got a tiramisu to share. Almost entirely lady fingers and mascarpone custard, there was no rum or coffee soaked into it. Sweet and tasty, but not quite tiramisu.

Overall, a good meal and great service from Tiffany. I'm a fan.),(The food was good, but there were a lot of problems. The bread was burnt (both servings), the waiter forgot to bring me a water, he gave my son an adult-sized soda even though I asked for a kids-sized soda, he charged me for an extra soda on the bill (check your bill!), and there were no paper towels in the bathroom. It was a freaking disaster, really. The three stars is for good food (other than the bread).)"

The chinese food is good and what you would expect nothing fancy.  They have recently remodeled part of the restaurant and now offer sushi.  The first time I ordered it I thought it was ok but nothing great - but last nights sushi was very good.  They have a fairly large sushi menu now with some inventive options.

I've been coming here for years and even used to frequent the other location in Blacksburg, VA. Where's Cabo's menu isn't s strong point for my taste, it's a great spot for a few margs, decent fish tacos, and perfect for street-side seating in the summertime. 

*Sigh*...the menu. Some of the items here just don't really push past the point of being worth the dollars. Believe me, the blackened tuna or mahi tacos are great. Love the slaw, the tortillas work well, they are piled high with goodies, and the flavors abound...but the rest of the plate? No thanks, brosef. The sides are ever-so lackluster. Jalapeno mashers? Ick. They never end up coming out right. Also, every time I've ordered a side of beans, I regret it. Also, for the veggie-lover, DON'T order the veggie burrito. The addition of zucchini and yellow squash inside the tortilla is an atrocity. But hey, if the sides are the worst part of their game, I think they are doing just fine for a NoDa staple. 

Also, be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The addition they have on the patio is awesome in the spring or summer. If you have a large group, you might end up with at least an hour wait on a busy night. I'm privy to heading here for lunch. Much more accessible. 

Cabo, you are welcome in my book. I'm not a huge fan of your side items, but your space is killer and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. Cheers!),(I really like Cabo for the atmosphere, menu, beers.  The food is just A-OK it's pretty consistent and you can get some very good tacos but as far as food network worthy mmm not so much.  I will continue to come back to this little joint though waiting for it to wow me.  This is a great place to take some friends for lunch and try out some unique fish tacos.  It's always bumping so be prepared for a wait.),(My friends in Charlotte raved about Cabo Fish Tacos and finally got a chance to try and boy was I surprised how good it was! It's really large and loud inside, and parking was hard to find so we had to pay for a spot nearby. 

Although I had been on a taco kick the past few days before, I knew I had to try their staple. Our server was super sweet, wish I caught her name, and helped me choose my tacos. Originally I was leaning towards the fried tacos because fried food is always better, but she told me her favorites were the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the honey soy glazed salmon tacos. I was hesitant about the sauces, so she said they would be on the side. You also get a choice of a side and I went with the spicy avocado pasta salad. I was hungry.

We munched on the chips and really yummy corn salsa and my glass of wine was delicious as well. When our food came out, the tacos were larger than I had imagined. Unfortunately they forgot to put the sauce on the side, but I liked them both!  The salmon was my absolute favorite, fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was superb. The lemon shrimp were tasty as well, and all the trimmings inside the taco were a perfect combo. The avocado pasta salad reminded me of a pesto pasta but it was really good. I demolished my entire meal to the last bite!

Will be back if I'm ever back in the area! Very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!),(Diners, Drive in and Dives! A must try place! So we trekked out after work yesterday. I love the location, Love the style, people and atmosphere. The place was packed! Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the vibe was hip and cool!

Service was a little slow! Chips were average and not fresh, Salsa was nothing much to speak of a bit of a disappointment.

I had three taco's Mahi, Shrimp Tara something..... all were good Tara was #1 Shrimp was #2 and Mahi was #3. Mashed Potatoes were forgettable),(The Good, the bad and the ugly.  Are you ready?  My waitress forgot my bloody mary, but she did bring me water.  Hey, thanks.  The chips were cold, cold like the bag was sitting outside.  The pico they serve with the chips had sad winter tomatoes and canned corn in it, also served refrigerator cold.  BRRRRRRR.

I ordered the special, wasabi shrimp burrito, it was not made with love. The flour tortilla was cold, it must be really cold in their kitchen.  The shrimp inside the burrito were good, if you took a shrimp bite it was warm but the burrito wasn't consistant, so some bites would be cold cheese and cold flour tortilla.  MMMMMMM, yum.

It is such a cute little place, maybe I will stick with drinking margaritas. As Homer Simpson would say, ""mmmmmmm. donuts\/beer\/erotic cakes.),(Funky layout.....hipster staff.....always hoppin' in some manner, the Cabo is a NoDa anchor.

Fish Tacos are the draw for me and the GF....this time I was only hungry enough for the guac and cheese dip and a few beers.

The outdoor patio has really made this place even better and with temps this last weekend being in the 70s it was perfect.),(Great burritos, god awful service.  It seems like they do some kind of misguided communal attempt at serving here, and then none of the servers communicate with each other so we ended up with multiples of some things and none of others.  Worst of all the servers seemed annoyed with US when we corrected them.  

Listen guys, theres a reason that 99% of restaurants have one waiter per table, BECAUSE IT WORKS.

On the brightside, the burrito I had was pretty damn good, so was my girlfriends, though I dont remember which ones they were, the fact that 2 different ones were good leads me to believe they have their burrito game on lock.  

Unfortunately I dont think I can suffer through the awful service again, but if it ever gets fixed, I'll definetly go back more often, shame really.),(I had the ""special"" which was a grilled scallop taco with pineapple salsa and the jalapeno\/cheddar mashers.  It was tasty but it didn't blow my mind.  However the crab\/shrimp dip with deep fried pita triangles was ON POINT.  I could eat that all day, everyday!

Their system is really simple and they make it efficient for sushi. We order three rolls total --two california and a veggie. The rolls take the staff a little while to prepare since they have to portion out the rice, nori, add all of the veggies, roll it up AND THEN they have this brilliant slicer machine! That was the most exciting moment for me. How smart they are...

We ordered the miso soup to go along with our sushi. Pretty standard and so good with the sushi. The cali rolls were great. Just as they should have been. The veggie rolls were good as well. Fresh, flavorful, simple, and filling.

I stumbled on to this after we left the fest - this is so clutch for next year. Not that I don't enjoy walking around the fest, but when it's insanely hot and there are tons of sweaty people eating stacks of meat and sugary baklava sundaes, sometimes to-go might be a more delicious option.

$2 gets you in...and if you have a friend in the surrounding Dilworth neighborhoods (who are absolutely affected by and consequently and potentially irritated by the traffic surrounding their homes) they typically get a handful of ""I'm sorry"" tickets for free entry into the fest.

Was originally going to go on Thursday night but we had torrential downpours in the area.  Went this afternoon (Sunday) and the weather could not have been nicer.  Clear skies, light breeze and temperatures in the 70's.

It was crowded as ususal so we ended up parking four blocks away and walking.  It was a pleasant walk and gave us a chance to see they old houses of Dilworth that were being renovated.

The festival was fantastic.  Several stages with dance exhibitions, great Greek Food and you could eat in or they had outside tables where you could also eat.

One high point was the fact that the priests gave lectures on the Cathedral, it's art and the significance of that art and differences between Eastern Orthodox vs Western or Roman Catholic practices.

The Cathedral is one of the most beautiful houses of worship in the Charlotte area and well worth taking the weekly tour at 3 pm on Saturday the rest of the year.

See picture. Note: if you order the same thing at Bar 10, the chicken is $3. The salad itself was only $9, but pricey given it is one piece of romaine lettuce grilled, it's pretty pricey. Not to mention, kind of odd - I've never had my romaine grilled. Not bad.

They recently changed their menu and increased prices. Burgers are one of the few actual foods that are under $25, but they have a ridiculous service charge and delivery fee if you order room service. Something like 11% and then 16%. Also the wait is sometimes over an hour. RIDIC. I hear the warm chocolate chip cookies are amazing. But I refuse to pay $10 for cookies or a pint of Haagen-Daaz when I can walk over to CVS and pick one up for $3.

4 stars because the shrimp was amazing (gigantic, fresh, and slightly salty) but really expensive. The chicken was generous and tender. And because they give you $25 coupons for breakfast or lunch or dinner, and that was enough to cover this uber expensive salad.

For main course, Mrs chose the Wicked Chicken Biscuit. The tabasco on the top was unexpected but the rest of it looked and tasted amazing. Really delish.

I chose the Grilled Cheese and it was absolutely excellent. The bite from the gorgonzola with the sweetness from the brie was terrific. Super delicious sandwich. The cole slaw on the side was great. A little vinegary, but still quite tasty.

A good meal, great service, I'm absolutely a fan!),(Tupelo Honey Cafe lives up to its hype.  My girl friend and I arrived on a weekday early evening and had no problems getting a seat.  Apparently this place is hot as a brunch spot.  Plenty of space inside, though outside was packed since it was nice out.  This place serves up some serious Southern fare.  Service was very nice and we were attended to most of the evening.  Don't come here if you're looking for anything close to healthy, by the way.

Fried Green Tomatoes - deliciously crispy on the outside and slightly tangy (as it should be) on the inside.  Served over their signature goat cheese grits.  Delicious - a must get!

Crispy lemon brussel sprouts - if anything, I would pass on these.  Very fried and not enough lemon flavor, or any flavor at all, really.  Not good if you hate brussel sprouts.

Baked mac and cheese - legit mac and cheese.  What more can I say?  Good ratio of cheese to macaroni.

Tupelo shrimp and grips (added chorizo) - y'all.  The chorizo does it here.  Absolutely worth the extra $3 as it gives the whole thing even more flavor and kick.  The grits, which are the same as in the fried green tomatoes.  The shrimp are large, juicy, plump, well-seasoned, and oh-so-delicious.  This was our favorite dish of the evening, hands down.  But - you have to add the chorizo!

Shoo mercy pancake - basically fried chicken (breast) and sweet potato pancake.  This thing was massive.  The sweet potato pancake was awesome and went very well with the peach butter and of course, maple syrup.  I don't care for thick cut special bacon... just prefer the normal boring Oscar Mayer stuff, so if this is your jam, you'd love the copious amounts of bacon on here.  The fried chicken breast was juicy and crispy and goes well with hot sauce and honey (trust me). This comes pretty close to the shrimp and grits.

Biscuits with homemade jam and tupelo honey - for some reason they never brought these out til halfway through our meal.  YAAAAAAAAS these are amazing, especially with the tupelo honey (the best!) and homemade berry jam.

Pecan pie - skip.  I've had better elsewhere.  Or maybe we were just too full.

Solid place for good service, great Southern food, and groups (on weekday evenings).),(Buttery, warm out of the oven biscuits fall apart in your mouth and not in your hand; accompanied by a simple preserve that lacks the overbearing sweetness of most that covet it's appearance. 

Fried green tomatoes that find the difficult sweet spot between toothsome and mushy with a batter that clings on for dear life allowing one to enjoy both the crisp crunch and buttery softness that the treat should provide. Set atop of a bed of grits, the red pepper coulis adds brightness and interest to a dish that begs for a spatula scrape or a brownie spoon lick at the end. 

The sweet potato pancake, if just a tad bit on the dryer side, is accompanied by near perfectly cooked fried chicken and a maple pepper bacon that adds to the complexity to the dish. 

The heaping 26 dollar portion of Shoo Fly Shrimp and Grits loads every bite with shrimp, so much so that they I believe this to be the first time I've ever taken home a shrimp dish with shrimp to be had. The spicy mix of peppers and mushrooms flavors the dish well, and I order chorizo on the side expecting crushed or cubed pieces, but instead get large moderately thick slices of the dark red spicy meat. 

Pork egg rolls have the appearance of being hastily rolled and are a bit too greasy for my liking. The only thing I would not be back for. 

Service is kind and warm. The hostess provides a level of southern charm that starts the meal on a very high note.),(If you are coming here for your momma's southern cooking, then you have come to the wrong place, but if you have come here for your momma's cooking meets artisan flavors and the new southern twist you are at the right spot.

I ordered the Texas toast grilled cheese, Havarti and Pimento cheese, with a bowl of tomato soup. For some reason this dish was screaming at me. I am really not that much of a fan of the tomato soup thing, but it goes with grilled cheese so well.  

G ordered the hamburger (well done) with the side of mac n cheese. 

While we were waiting for our order, they brought out what could have been the star of the show. The amazing drop biscuit. This is not your cookie cutter biscuit. Its buttery, cheesy, a little salty, with just a hint of rosemary. Oh I want to jump in a tub of these delicious bundles of heavenliness.  They also bring you the honey and that jam, damn the jam....why are you so good. You just know they have some grandma's in the back making this jam. It taste just like homemade jam. Did I mention the jam???  

Ok, now back to the food.  It did seem that the food did take a bit longer than what I would have expected to arrive. The restaurant was not extremely busy, so it seemed odd. We were in no rush, except for the food, and since we have no issues with conversation it was all good. While waiting I ordered the blueberry punch. It was so refreshing and tasted like it could have been an beverage that would have been a great mix of flavors to go with vodka. I'm so old that I remember when vodka did not come in flavors. It was just vodka. You had to flavor it yourself. 

The meal came and the presentation was really nice.  G bit into his hamburger immediately and said it was great. I did try a bite and I agreed, even though it was well done, they somehow were able to keep it juicy. He also had the side of Mac n Cheese and this is where momma's Mac n Cheese goes rogue. This side had some kick. It was pumped up with peppery goodness.
The only thing this side was missing was the crusty cheesy top that you usually get when you order Mac n Cheese. This side was definitely a new twist on an old favorite. There was also a side salad which was very fresh and colorful. It was topped with sunflower seeds and two of their dressing to try. Next was to dig into my amped up grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was hot and toasty and buttery. The hot inside Havarti and Pimento Cheese was oozing out, a cheesy perfection of a sandwich. I was trying to figure out how to duplicate this at home. Now the tomato soup. It was creamy, but not your typical Campbells retro creamy stuff. This soup had little bits and pieces of tomato in the soup. The soup was hot and amazing and wait, I don't even like tomato soup but this was so good. They give you such a large bowl there is no finishing the soup unless your just ravenous. I did find room for all of the sandwich. Not a crumb left on the plate.

I would be giving this visit 5 stars, but the wait time for the food was a bit on the lengthy side.
Did I mention the biscuit and jam? Just go for drinks and biscuits and life will be perfect, or at least seem that way.),(We've been to Charlotte before, but somehow we missed out on this mug of awesomeness! Thankfully we made it this time.

When I say simple, it's in the best way possible. Not glitz and glamour for Z's. A few simple murals on the wall depicting a map of northern Africa and most of the Mediterranean...and that's about it. It's all about the food here. Just how it should be. 

The staff is very kind. Even courteous enough to ask if you've ever ""experienced Mediterranean food before"" and walk you through the different preparations and choices. Much of which can vary slightly, but always good for a refresher. 

Onward to the meal! My wife got the Falafel platter. Perfect orbs of crispy outside and warm, soft, flavorful inside. Not dry and also not overly moist. Topped generously with a mix of veggies and fantastically mixed tabbouleh. Finally! A place that uses bulgar wheat! The pickled veg was incredible. 

I ordered the mixed platter. All three skewers they have with a dashingly colorful salad and pita\/hummus. The chicken by far has the most flavor. Charred bits from the grill and marinated in something that fell from the heavens. The lamb and beef skewers also retained a ton of flavor. All of the spice mixtures are pungent but not overpowering. Perfect balance from three equally delicious animals. 

The place is clean, busy, simple and has flavors that will make you think you're chillin in Tel Aviv. Can't wait to go back and get the Shawarma platter!)"

There may be a few folks that would rather be kicked in the head than go to the mall, but you can drive behind Belk and park in the garage, right in front of the door and Arthur's has a few 15 minute  parking spots.  So you can just run in and grab something.  Plenty of knowledgable staff if you get stumped on your decision making!

They also offer classes, it's well worth getting on their email list, it's something fun to do.  Last night they just had their yearly Champagne tasting.  Much fun.  I do find that they have paid tastings and free tastings.  I prefer to go to the paid tastings, they are more generous with the wine when it is paid.

Great selection of crepes including the savories and the sweets and so my wife chose one of the latter while I had one of the former.

Very well stuffed, my ""Americana"" was a bit breakfasty with egg, cheddar, avocado, spinach and tomato. I slathered some Sriracha on top as well. Yum and I was full!

My wife had the Nutella and banana and it had the usual nutella and banana in side. Not too sweet at all, with a very light dusting of powdered sugar on top.

A cooler with sodas and juices is available. I had a coffee that was not so great (but then, I was at Not Just Coffee a few minutes before so my taste buds had a high expectation).

Nice place for an inexpensive breakfast if you're in the area. Parking? Uh... good luck.),(I'd like to second the notion that Hazelnuts has some of the best crepes in the QC and I'll even go a step further and say they have the best variety as well. There are few places in town to grab crepes and these guys do a fantastic job. 

I had tried to visit a few times in the past but my plans were thwarted by either long lines or impossible parking situations. That should probably be your first plan of attack. Unless you're a briefcase-toting Uptowner or just so happen to find yourself at 200 S Tryon...by happenstance, then you'll have to make the blessed trek of parking. If it's just for a meal, do your damndest to find a meter on 3rd or even out front on Tryon. God speed to you!

The crepes themselves? Hard to say about the thin layer of crepe as the varieties we tried were masked by some awesomely pungent flavors. With that being said, I'm sure you can order a more simplistic crepe if you're in the mood for au originale. For those craving concoctions, the Chipotle Chicken and the Mariachi are rather tasty. Though stuffed to the rafters with foodstuffs, it's a nice breakfast or lunch. I really dig the chipotle chicken, but it did have lettuce playing second fiddle to spinach. Really? Not a fan of that at all. Lettuce does not hold up to heat nearly at all and it made a limp mess inside of my crepe. 

The prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get. I think most would be full after one stuffed crepe. I couldn't finish mine or the one we shared. 

Glad to have finally tried Hazelnuts. Great folks over there.),(Excellent little nook located just inside the building lobby. This is a great place to grab a quick & delicious bite. Ayonna & Tashia (I really hope I spelled their names correctly) were amazingly pleasant & accommodating. Usually I like a sweet crepe but today I was in the mood for something savory so I opted for The Santorini (86 the olives, add chicken, sub egg whites) because that's how I roll. Ayonna aimed to please and made the perfect version just for me. Needless to say I devoured Santorini, wishing I could go back for seconds. 

The setup is similar to Subway...you can view all the toppings opposite side of the glass as the crepe is being built. There are plenty of beverages and chips should you desire. Hazelnuts is a staple when in Charlotte. The bookmark stays in place.

I chose the Nick's Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.

Decent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.

Parking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is ""Good luck.),(Love me some Bad Daddy's! 

The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either location. 

The burgers\/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!

The wings fit well on the ""expected"" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef. 

The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.

The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar\/dairy laden enjoyment. 

Outdoor seating is phenomenal and you really can't go wrong on a spring day on East Blvd while being outside. The hightop communal tables at East Blvd cause a bit of a backup\/walking issues. Beware if you are trying to get out while its busy. 

Service is always friendly and fast. These guys are doing a great job with their entire chain of restaurants across the Queen City. Hats off, ladies and gents. 

Great Charlotte staple. Perfect place for 2, family, with kids or whatever.),(Having just finished the college tour right up the street at Queens,  appetites were revved up and the choice was an old familiar Bad Daddy's.   We've been to this location several times PY (Pre Yelp) and we've become accustomed to this particular locations food and service quality, but it doesn't hold at other locations in CLT unfortunately.   

The parking here though is awful and during the week,  ""fuh-get-aboutit,""  unless you arrive at 1130a.  But being the weekend it was a bit better but not by much and we lucked out with an open spot.

There's ample seating inside and out albeit can be a bit tight inside.  We were promptly sat and didn't take long for the drinks, placing the app order, and the lunch selections.

Choices this time were fried pickles,  all American burger with onion rings,  bison burger,  and all American with tots.  It was shark eyes all around.   Those who've read my post know that is my saying to describe the frenzy or rather enjoyment due to the quality of the food,  i.e., when sharks feed they have a protective film that extends to cover their eyes to protect against the food particles\/blood etc. from damaging their eyes,  so you get the idea :).  Yep, so the fam had shark eyes all around  ;)!  They really enjoyed the food.

Total came to 62.00 including tip for 3 people and an app, so it's a bit pricey imo, but this particular location serves good quality food with good service and has done so consistently so its worth it.),(Some of the best (and most creative) burgers in town. The Frenchie is incredible - turkey burger with apples, brie and special sauce. Their create your own salads are great, too! Fantastic drink specials and amazing milkshakes, too!),(I am officially 5 lbs heavier than I was 2 hours before dinner here. 

APPS:
We started with the Bacon Cheesebuger Mac n Cheese. Seriously - this is THE BEST mac n cheese I've ever had. Perfectly cheesy, creamy, and chock full of burger patties and crispy bacon pieces. 

The fried pickles were interesting, and served with a side of ranch. Don't think I would get these next time since it was 85% fat and oil, and 15% pickle. No points deducted because everything on the menu that is any good has a comparable nutrition value.

BURGERS:
Sam I Am - AMAZING. Added mushrooms and avocado and it was perfect. So perfect I didn't even dip into the spicy sauce it came with. I chose the tater tots as my side, meh... TOO SALTY. Other options include salads.

DESSERTS:
Desserts were pretty unimpressive. I settled with the banana pudding for lack of better options (instead of the brownie with fudge and ice cream, apple cobbler, or milkshakes). $5 gets you a heaping portion of whipped cream, a couple chopped bananas, and a generous drizzle of caramel. Not bad, but far too rich and not banana-y or pudding-y enough.

The wait was about 20 minutes at 8:15pm which I find odd in Charlotte, but the waitress was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. There are cool milkshake options you can order with alcohol, beer samples, and about 10 different types of bottled beer (yum, they have Rogue!). There's alfresco seating, but the patio was full so we sat by a huge flat screen TV, perfect for all you sports fans. The waitress also split our extremely complex bill in many complex ways without any complaints. Plus, the owner came out to make sure everything was good! Extra points for that.

The only downfall is that I need to detox for 5 days now :(),(Big Daddy's Burger Bar is a good meeting place. Outdoor seating and under $20 per person.   I had a patty melt with pimento cheese, it's not on the menu, I made it up and I enjoyed it!  (For a kick, add jalapenos).   We ordered onion straws and tater tots, love the idea of tots, they aren't easy to find in restaurants, but they didn't come out hot. Lukewarm fried foods coming out of the kitchen is one of my biggest restaurant peeves.  My friend ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon.  In my best robot voice, must try jalapeno  bacon .  We shared a chocolate milkshake, their milkshakes are a MUST!!!  Some people ask about where can you get rare hamburgers, they take a temp when you order.  Big Daddy's gets a three tot rating.

They have french fries cooked in duck fat on Thursday, Friday & Saturday, I have never had them, but I hear it's a treat.  It seems like all my visits are never on the weekend.  Must get out there and try those fries.),(So after a gruling night of Trivia at the Lesbian bar Hartigans.........Arin and I were on the winning team mind you *grin*....we decided we need a little food before heading home.

So after my last experience at BDBB and some offline chats with the owner I decided to give them another chance......and this place rocks the tater tots, so.............off we went.

Being a Wednesday night around 10pm it was slow and we sat at the bar.....again.  We ordered our drinks and a little side of the TTs.  Next to us was a gentleman that had a plastic tupperware (or what looked like it) jug half full with beer..............hmmm....so we inquired and realized Wednesday was mug night....bring in any mug and get it filled for $4!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wow........working with numbers and realizing how big of a mug you could bring in...............Now this place understands what a recession is all about...............a good deal!

The food arrived and everything was tasty.  No issues this time.................but....and you knew there had to be a but...........the waiter stand that is where I saw the horror last time is right beside the mens bathroom, so when I went in I literally had to raise my right arm to misse the mutliple pitchers of Tea and water that were stacked on that surface...........I know the space is small....and I'm not trying to bust anyone's b*lls, but personally I'd move that station somewhere else if possible, though it may not be due to the current configuration.

So 3 stars are good for now...I'll come back again soon and if they continue to deliver, I'll continue to up the stars.....heck I'd do it just for the tater tots!  *wink*.),(OMG! This place deserves an extra star just for being absolutely delicious! When they talk about Finger Licking good they are referring to Bad Daddy's Burgers!!!

I lived in Charlotte for a bit and this was a frequent stop for me. I came here at least once a week. The very first time I had a burger with an egg on it was here at Bad Daddy's. The burgers here are easily going to be one of the best burgers you'll ever have. I know that's how it is for me. 

Not craving a burger? No problem- you can build your own sandwich. I built my own chicken sandwich which was succulent and juicy. You can see from the pic I posted in this review that the bacon just looks crispy and delicious. 

The service here is on point. The wait staff are extremely attentive and granted you will not be disappointed at all. 

It's a perfect location, just the only thing that's a hit is the parking, but I usually park across the street next to Caribou.  

If you are craving one of the best burgers you'll ever put in your mouth you MUST check out Bad Daddy's!),(Burger #190: In Good Company

Thank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it. 

When out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too ""Eli"" like. But when the menu said ""Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids"" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile. 

Behold;
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQ

It was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great. 

The coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger.)"

Or, in the case of Duck Donuts, any time the urge befalls your day. Having good, nay, fantastic doughnuts in the hood is something that is somewhat of a foreign concept to Charlotte, for the most part. You've got your larger brands with plenty of presence, but having a smaller company show up in good ol' Crown Town is a welcome sight. 

Now, doughnuts are not too difficult to make acceptable in most doughnut-eaters' eyes. Serve em warm, slathered with glaze, and not much else. You're on your merry way to a great day when hot doughnuts are thrown in the mix. Duck Donuts is doing it right. Though, their process is pretty unique from others. 

First of all, the menu is rather simple. Doughnuts, coffee, a few breakfast sandwiches, and a few other things here and there. You order your doughnuts from the counter by singles or by the dozen, they are prepared on-the-spot, and served at the other end of the counter. 

The apparatus that forms and fries the doughnuts is so rad. It's a automatic dispenser that drops the perfectly formed doughnuts into the oil and then moves them along a conveyor belt. It's unlike any other I've seen. They do happen to have two of these guys for when the lines get longer and they need to crank out more fried dough. 

Note: ALL of their doughnuts are of the same base. (Cake Doughnuts) I.e. Not a yeast-based recipe. They are actually rather light and possess a perfect amount of crunch on the exterior. Not super heavy and dense like some other cake doughnuts of the world.  

So far, we've tried a handful --
Lemon
Cinnamon Sugar
Glazed
Peanut Butter
Strawberry

By far, the glazed wins every single time. It's just so perfect and easy. Eat them warm or after a few hours and they retain the same flavor and texture. I'm sure heating them in the oven wouldn't be a bad call either. 

Very impressed with these guys. Their varieties of doughnuts will certainly win over tons of local Dilworth eating talent and I'm sure we'll plan on many a visit in the near future. 

Welcome to the 'hood, Duck Donuts!),(Still not sure if I like yeast or cake donuts better,  but ducks cake donuts sure are awesome.  the maple with or without bacon is probably my favorite.   try the cake donuts then immediately drive to Krispy Kreme for a yeast donut...its hard to decide!),(You can't go wrong with made-to-order cake donuts and freshly brewed coffee. I got the Cinnamon Sugar with Vanilla Drizzle (holiday spirit donut, anyone?!) and Peanut Butter and Chocolate Drizzles, freaking delicious.

How it works:
- Choose your coating: glazed, powdered sugar, or icing.
- Choose your topping: sprinkles, chocolate, graham Cracker, chopped peanuts, bacon Pieces, shredded coconut, or oreos.
- Choose your drizzle: hot fudge, marshmallow, salted caramel, raspberry, or blackberry.

This shop is right off of Independence, next to a handful of fairly sketchy looking pawn shops. But hey, anything for pie, right? I knocked on the door and a very kind woman opened up for me and I stood, mouth agape, perusing the various varieties of mini and standard sized pies. Apple, cherry, pumpkin, blueberry, strawberry rhubarb, chocolate cream, key lime and more. Yes, even chicken pot pie! I selected three mini pies, paid the very affordable $16 and change and went on my merry way. Note - she also makes cakes and cupcakes and can create a variety of requests, just call a day or two ahead! 

The cherry pie I sampled last night was legit. No craptastic bright red, high fructose corn syrup in that little pie. It tasted almost like a spiced cherry pie. The strawberry rhubarb filling was just about perfect...I'll certainly get another mini of that variety again in the near future. My only ish? Because the pies are stored in plastic wrap, the crust was a bit tough and chewy. I pulled the other two mini pies from their plastic wraps and stored them in foil for future snacking.

I have been so excited to try Tamaleria ever since I read The Observer piece about it. This place is tucked in a strip mall on Arrowood Road, next to where the Salvation Army does its Christmas Center. It's not very big, just a handful of tables. Our group wanted to dine in, so we took Faith D's advice and went early at 11:30am on a Wednesday. If the tables are all full, just get your order to go. Super quick and easy. Probably a good thing I don't live near here, I would be stopping by every day to grab some tamales. 

We wanted to try a little bit of everything. Our order for three people: six tamales, four empanadas, two chorizo tacos, and a Mexican Coke. The grand total: $26. That's a lot of food, folks. We mixed it up with several different tamale preparations\/variations: chicken, pork, mole, verde, red sauce... I thought they were all good. There are also some vegetarian and dessert tamale options. The chorizo tacos were delicious. They bring a few different sauces to the table. I recommend trying a small amount of each to experience the different flavors and heat levels. Want to make a meal of it? You can score two tamales, rice, and beans for about $7.

Everyone here was so nice. If you're a little shy about trying a tamaleria, don't worry. There are pictures everywhere to help guide you. They do take credit cards. I recommend bringing several friends so you can order a lot and try a little bit of everything.)"

They do a really great job with seasonal menus as well. Unlike the flagship store in NoDa, this one also serves alcoholic bevvies. *pops bottle*

I haven't been back to an Amelie's in six years, but it never disappoints.  The space is huge at this location and has plenty of space.  This space would be great for work or studying.

Amelie's has a massive, massive case of French macarons, tarts, brownies, creme brulees, cream puffs... the list goes on and on.  The prices are fairly reasonable, too.  They have a tea and coffee bar as well.  I'd recommend this place as a nice breakfast spot, afternoon snack, or after dinner dessert.  It might even be a good place to take a date :)

After a long and hard decision, I decided to get the salted caramel brownie.  It was delicious!  It's much less brownie than it is a salted caramel... bar.  I didn't really taste all that much chocolate, or at least it wasn't overpowering.  I actually prefer this.  The whole thing was probably a billion calories as it was really rich and buttery (but not too much!) - so worth it.  Have these on your cheat day.

I also had a blue and yellow (lavender and chamomile) tea with my little dessert.  Perfect for a relaxing evening dessert.

I will definitely be back to try the other desserts.  Maybe even for breakfast if I want to indulge.),(Everyone meets clients for drinks. 
You want to be everyone? I don't think so.

You'd like the casual, unorthodox and cluttered décor with the untraditional lamps and interesting chandeliers. 
Personally, other than the salted caramel brownie, I can barely resist the flaky layers of the Napoleon. On the savory side, I like the Roast Beef Croissant. I'm pretty sure that charming Parisian girl named Amélie would have loved their Café au lait as much as I do.

Five Yelps.),(A stunning, MASSIVE space located right in the heart of uptown. Coming from Chicago, I couldn't believe how cheap Amelie's desserts were! I really had to fight the urge to grab multiples of everything in the display case. Especially when they're offering different free samples every day, you KNOW how good everything tastes and it gets harder and harder to choose. 

Everything from the macarons to the eclairs, petit fours to mousse was top notch. It was a definite repeat visit for us on our short three day trip! It was even BF-approved, and he's not a big dessert guy. Mouthwateringly great.

Pro-Tip: DON'T MISS THE SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE (which also comes in macaron form, too!)),(From the time you lay eyes on this little French haven you'll feel as if you're in France (literally). Then you walk inside and become completely engulfed in French inspired décor from towers similar to Eiffel, baker's in those tall puffy white hats tossing dough around in the glass window of the pastry kitchen, bonjour paintings, gold furnishings, candelabras and a salivating. The bakery case is filled with all kinds of delicious goodies: eclairs, cakes, muffins, brownie bars and the most beautiful macaroons EVER. I couldn't help but order one of each flavor:

It was so gorgeous I didn't want to drink it in an attempt to preserve its presentation. It was even topped with sweet praline crumbs. The brioche was excellent, just enough goat cheese to compliment to crispy sweet puff pastry. Once my sweet tooth wore off I went back a couple hours later for lunch with a few dining partners. Their orders ranged from croissant sandwich to the Pick 2 option, consisting of 1\/2 sandwich and soup or salad, I opted for the Spinach & Mushroom crepe with side salad. All portions were small (typical for a French bakery) but very tasty. If you're looking for a meal that will fill you up this isn't it however, it is definitely worth stopping in for a healthy portion of quality food.

We we were in a little bit of a time crunch, and with luggage it was a bit tricky.

Fortunately, the hotel stowed our luggage as we made our way to the 21st floor. The view from up there is quite nice, but there was a huge party of at least 35 people celebrating someone's 81st birthday and a wedding engagement. Someone from that party offered their apologies and offered us drinks on them, which was very thoughtful, but we weren't drinking.

We explained our situation about the flight and the waitress accommodated us and rushed our orders. For starters, we had Kung Pao chicken wings and chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Both fantastic, but the dates were my favorite.

For the main course we had a rack of lamb and a lo mein wagyu short rib. Once again, both great dishes. Finally for dessert we had the Fahrenheit bar and the cookies and cream torte. You guessed it, equally fantastic.

What could make this meal better? The fact that the party decided to pay for our meal. Such a nice thing to do, and I had to thank them multiple times because it was really unnecessary (they were not wild, intrusive, or crazy at all). 

So it was a great meal and a good way to leave the east coast.),(If you're looking for an incredible view; overlooking the Charlotte skyline, or looking for unexceptional, yet expensive meal, then you're at the right spot.
Fahrenheit is one of the few ways to see Charlotte skyline in the most luxurious way. The magic comes alive as the last rays of the sun kiss the glimmering buildings of Charlotte. 
I went during Queen's Feast (aka Charlotte Restaurant Week) and for $35 I had the Wood Grilled Avocado, Grilled Filet and the Cookies and Cream Torte. I enjoyed my meal and I'm glad I knocked it during restaurant week. Typically they serve it at a higher price point, and I don't think it's worth it.

Pros: 
- Indoor & outdoor dining.
- Elegant fire pit all year round.
- great for dates\/ group dining.

Cons:
- A tad expensive.
- Popular spot, specially after sunset, and service can slower then. 

Three and Half Yelps.),(But oh, about that view...

Imagine yourself, suspended amidst Charlotte's tallest buildings. Now, insert a cocktail,  some bites (no vampires allowed) and hopefully a few laughs and you're good money. 

I always love dropping by here whenever I'm in town. The view is just epic and no matter the time of day, I've always been able to find room to enjoy the view around the perimeter on the balcony, even when the restaurant and bar are pretty full. 

The outdoor fire pits are dazzling and elegant and service has always been stellar. The food that I've tried has been pretty decent too, but keep in mind the portions may be a little petite depending on what you choose to order. 

If you're looking for a skyline view and an opportunity to drink a cocktail with your pinky up without an overtly pretentious crowd, then Fahrenheit is a good look for you!),(Aaron did an amazing job serving our party of 6 during the busy Queen's Feast Week, a dining out celebration where select restaurants in the Charlotte area offer an abbreviated menu for a reasonable price ($35). This gives patrons the opportunity to try several dishes on the restaurant's menu, spend less than normal on the usual 3 course meal and creates business buzz for participating restaurants.

Fahrenheit was a no-brainier once I went to check the venue and saw its amazing rooftop view of Uptown Charlotte. It's located on the 21st floor and gives an amazing skyline picturesque scenery of the city. There is also a gorgeous fire pit for those taking a glimpse in the cooler evening hours. 

On to dinner: the salmon was delicious, prepared medium just as I requested. The chocolate mouse dessert was decent and the avocado appetizer was tasty enough to get the palette going but nothing to write home about; personally I felt the bread was a bit overbearing and would've been better served on a thin crostini instead. 

I particularly enjoyed the ambiance of Fahrenheit more than anything else. Linen napkins, dim lighting, tea light centerpieces, an intimate full bar area with plush lounge seating and secluded booths for couples. My experience was memorable and I'd certainly recommend Fahrenheit for date night, girls night out, happy hour or just celebrating a special occasion.

~Christy),(**Review in regards to Large Party Booking - Not in regards to food or service** 

I am really disappointed in the way that they book large parties. I contacted these guys in regards to booking my engagement party in which the representative on the phone took all my information and assured me someone would call me back. A day goes by and because of the urgency of my approval I contacted Fahrenheit again. This time I got someone on the phone and they said that the restaurant was booked and had actually been booked for a couple weeks out as there's lots of events happening downtown Charlotte and they would not be able to accommodate us. Because of my desire to have my party at Fahrenheit I wasted an entire day waiting on a call back only if the first rep that I talk to new what the second rep knew I wouldn't have been waiting and wasting days.


**Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate),(So sad that on a Wednesday night, when the bar seems busy, they close at 11pm! I mean, I get it, you gotta close earlier on the weekdays... but I just wanna enjoy my late night drink! 

We were the jerks who came in at around 5 minutes to 11pm, but they were kind enough to serve us and let us chill outside to enjoy the beautiful downtown view. Not only do you get that beautiful view, but it's really a pretty patio too. With a modern chic fire burning and outdoor seating to cozy up on. 

My Aviation was perfection too. Only wish I had time to get another one!)"

Why do I say this? Three words: Bar Plates Menu. It's only available during the week. Sorry weekenders. The BPM (why yes, I did decide to shorten it) has plates starting at $3.95, including a beef carpaccio that is delicious and a big size portion. You can't really go wrong with anything on this list for the price. I love the eggplant fries, too.

If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, Brio does have a great patio. Like Desiree F said in an earlier review, I don't go here a whole lot. There are just a lot of great places in this area. I've always had good service here. The atmosphere is nice. My last visit I talked to the manager on duty for a long time. She was really sweet. Parking is annoying for me, but that's more because I don't come here a whole lot and all the decks look the same. 

Brio has a rewards program. You can get a card or download the app. After five visits, you can get $10 off your 6th.),(I was doing some shopping at the mall for running shoes and it was lunch time so I headed over to Brio for their Chopped Salad and a beer.  Got out of there for less than 10 bucks...not bad.

I sat at the bar, but during the late afternoon the place was dead...so either there or in front of the kitchen are good spots if you don't like sitting in a place with no one in it.),(Having lived in Virginia before coming to Charlotte, I frequented the Brio in Tysons Corner quite often. It was a nice place for lunch and dinner with friends. 

Since moving, I've visited this location three times and it does not disappoint. This location has a larger dining room and bar area than the one that I was accustomed to. And since the VA one was in a mall, it lacked the outdoor seating that this one has. Which is a definite plus!

The food here is terrific. I'm a fan of their pastas. Good portions, nice flavor. Good stuff.

We also had the chocolate molten lava cake. I must say, it was delicious. 

Service was fast and attentive. Our meal was out pretty quick. Our waitress was especially warm and personable and gave her share of suggestions. 

Price isn't bad. Definitely a nice place to take a special someone to dinner. The bar area is cool too. And apparently they have appetizer specials in the bar area on weeknights.

Definitely worth checking out!)"

Really, you can park at either the theatre in Stonecrest or in front of Firebirds and everything is walkable. Really dig that about this location. 

The interior: Awesome. It's like walking into a swanky lumberjack's den. There's exposed wood, firewood, more wood....and wooden things. Dimly lit, high ceilings, lanterns....or ""man""terns, for that matter. Just a really cool feel. I really like the split level, too. 

Our service was VERY attentive. I really can't stress how much this guy wanted to serve us. His name was Brett and he was thorough, nice, educated, and well-placed throughout the meal. 

We started with their signature cocktail -- Black Diamond Martini. I have to say it was a total letdown. Their infused citron vodka was like dull pineapple juice. It housed no kick and was just....meh. I mean, I really dig pineapple juice, but $10 pineapple juice? Think I'll pass.

I have to comment on the bread they serve pre-meal. What IS that loaf? I've never seen that shape, structure, or texture in bread before! Coated in semolina...which gets all over you and the table, by the way, and is almost cracker-like on the exterior with a slight chew in the middle. It tastes just fine, but man....what a strange recipe\/method. 

I ordered the coconut shrimp for an entree. I've been on a kick of ordering things I normally wouldn't on a given night. Sigh....it was just boring. 10 semi-large shrimp, a cabbage slaw with tortilla chips, large steak fries, and an awful mango-habanero dipping sauce. The shrimp were fine au naturale, but that dipping sauce totally ruins everything. I'd rather have ketchup and that's really bad. 

I love the decor and the service. The food and sig cocktail....not so much. I'd love to come back and just sit at the bar with a beer before a movie, though! I'ma get my plaid on, kick back and enjoy that wood-laden ambiance! Cheers.),(The prime rib was 5 stars. YUM. (Note: I'm easy to please and also like Outback Prime Rib). Apologies for comparing it to Outback, it's definitely more upscale and with mostly higher quality ingredients.

Spinach lobster queso dip is just one of those things you can't mess up. I've had few places botch this one up, definitely something I would get again if I'm looking to fatten up a bit. The wings were ordinary.

The shrimp skewer (add $5) and lobster tail were tough; eating them is like gnawing on rock salt. Totally not worth the extra money, but it's all good because it was sponsored by my company (YEAUHHH BOIII). 0 stars for this one.

The creme brulee cheesecake was like crack - a huge portion of awesomely rich and creamy  cheesecake, topped with a thin layer of crystallized sugar. Could not stop gorging myself on this. If you like Key Lime Pie, you would love the one here, creamy and tangy, also served in generous portions. The brownie a la mode was decent, just stay away from the chocolate cake (dry and just bleh!).

Overall, great service, (mostly) great food... don't forget to try their pineapple cocktail! Points deducted for the horrendous wait for a table and that they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 8.),(The food is five stars. The service is five stars. The location is five stars. Everything about this Firebirds was awesome. At last minute I was calling around looking for a restaurant that was willing to cook for my party of 25. We are celebrating an engagement and wanted to celebrate somewhere nice in the Charlotte area. The location is outside of downtown and it happened to be a little further than what I wanted but they were willing to accommodate such a large party at the last minute. Great service as they were willing to take on the task of cooking for such a large group and the food was fantastic. The ambience was great as well. The prices aren't that bad as I would consider this fine dining.

The staff at Taziki's were the some of the nicest restaurant employees I've ever met.  We striked conversations and bantered about their pumpkin carving contest.  They all seemed like they liked working at the restaurant!

I wanted something on the healthy side, so I ordered their Greek salad with grilled lamb on top, along with a small bowl of their lemon chicken soup (which comes with rice apparently, but they ran out).  The Greek salad was very fresh and the lamb (3 pieces) were grilled to perfection, though not very seasoned.  The lemon chicken soup had plenty of chicken in it and was actually very lemony and sour, which I liked.  The salad dressing is one of the tastier ones I've had at a chain as well.

I ordered the Thai Kew Teaw which was grilled noodles, chicken, peppers, grilled onions, and a heavenly sriracha-esque sauce. Reminded me a lot of many other Thai dishes I've ordered with the smoky flavor of the noodles and the grilled, crispy veggies. My wife ordered a veggie noodle dish. Loved the thick lo mein noodles. The sauce they were tossed in was very mild and simple. 

The soups were great. Egg drop and hot & sour. The hot and sour was very thick and a little more on the sour side. Also, it had pork in it which is a little different. Not a bad addition. The eggdrop was very good. Thick and creamy, with tons of great egg  flavor.

And due to Leanne C's nerdy, but correct, engineering & math skillz, I now recall the reason why the 16"" pie costs more than twice than the 8"" pie. You see, folks, using the formula A=pi*rsquared. Yes, that's pi * the radius squared, an 8"" pie has an edible area of 50.24 sq. inches and the 16"" pie has an edible area of 200.96 sq inches.

That's the only way I can describe it.  And on top of that, I got another plate of bread (which turned out to be the injera) with what I can only describe as looking like rags.

To my surprise, this strange looking food was actually quite delicious.  I enjoyed the experience of having to use the injera (bread) to pick up the different meats and such.  The meat and the lentils were very very flavorful and different from anything I'd ever had before. 

It's probably not something I could handle eating more than once every couple of months, but it's a great type of food to socialize over and actually kinda fun at the same time :P)"

Plenty of seating inside, and we're talking the funky, IKEA-style seating. Comfy couches, lounge chairs, and bar stools. 

The wine is stacked high on the right wall in funky wine racks. Take your pick. I love how they split up the varieties. As an individual who doesn't know a lot about wine, or pretend to know a lot about wine, I appreciate the simple approach. Listed above each area, you'll see ""Creamy,"" ""Tart,"" ""Bright,"" and other descriptors. It makes it more interesting for someone like me. I don't even know where to begin when wines are listed under their country of origin. Vin Master is doing it right. 

We picked up a fun-looking bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. I haven't really moved past whites just yet. I still need a bright, semi-sweet wine to actually say I ""enjoy"" it. 

Next time, especially if the weather is nice, we'll be hanging out here al fresco. Great patio on the tracks and a killer, quiet space to enjoy a glass or three. Cheers!),(Hooray for a wine shop in South End! Vin Master is such a convenient stop - right across from Atherton Market. Grab some delicious dips, some fresh veggies, perfect fish and talk to Chris (owner of Vin Master) about the best bottle to accompany your meal. Perfecto. 

This particular wine shop is so special as Chris is everything but pretentious. He's laid back, helpful, friendly and genuinely wants to make sure your happy with your vino. He also offers free tastings on Wednesdays, $6 flights (of 2 wines) and a really unique flavor profile system that I just can't wait to get the results! This flavor profile will help him to steer me in a delicious direction for wines that please my palate. 

With wines of all price points and flavors, so I'm sure the folks here can help you find what you're seeking. Stop in Vin Master, take in the simple and lovely surrounding and sip on a tasty glass, inside or outside. Cheers!),(Saturday, I plan on making my first trip to Atherton Market to check out the Spring arrivals.  I know it's been open all Winter, but it has fallen off my radar. So I get it in my head, it's time to get to Atherton.  I am meeting a friend,  I didn't want to blow my wad and go in before her arrival.  When she arrives, I'm like, ""let's go see what Vin Master Wine Shop is.""  One bottle of Prosecco later, 30 minutes after the closing of Atherton Market, we decide Vin Master is a great spot to have a glass of wine.

There aren't many places in Charlotte that you can drink wine at retail prices, I happen to love this!  Wine tastes even better when it's not marked up four times.  Vin Master is an exposed brick wall, open floor plan with plenty of good light.  A little wine store with a few couches and a table for the campers!  

A great venue, some outdoor seating would knock it out of the park,( just like Darrell Strawberry).  I hate sports, I can't believe, I even made a sports reference.  Drink up people. Cheers.)"

Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice.

I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty.

This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that.

I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography.),(The ""Chinese"" food at Manchu Wok is disgusting. If I could give zero stars, I would. This swill (General Tso's chicken was soft and reminded me of GLUTEN) was so absurdly bad that I couldn't finish it, and my friends know I can eat ANYTHING. The lo-mein was tasteless. It was ""Panda Express""-expensive, but not remotely as tasty.

I ate here when I was semi-stranded at the Charlotte Douglas airport overnight - the only positive was that the meal was comped by the airline.

Everytime you eat there, God kills a kitten. Oh, and Manchu Wok profits. Avoid this place.),(See the picture for this place? My plate was almost exactly the same. Those stuff were just alright - very generic Chinese-American fast food glop. Honestly, if you eat here, you can't really expect more than that, can you? Not even in the 21st century. Or the 22nd. Or the 23rd.

But that being said - those green beans were tasteless and the worst of the lot on that plate. And they make sure to give you a lot of those.

Salad with four toppings was decent and filling and I left thinking that I had made a good choice.

One thing about this food court is the scenery. Lots of people very well dressed (or not well dressed, depending on how you look at it) and way too many teenagers primped for their friends. Was I ever like that? Don't answer that question.),(In a food court full of calorie filled menus (and people entirely too overdressed to go shopping), it's refreshing to have a guilt-free option like Crunch Bistro.

My order: Portobello Wrap. Sun dried tomato tortilla. roasted portobellos, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, spinach and balsamic vinaigrette. Portobellos, goat cheese and roasted red peppers: a trio of perfection. Every sandwich, wrap, salad, whatevs... should contain those three items. 

My lunchtime friends went with salads: the Waldorf and the Cali Crunch. Both added portobellos. The salads looked amazing. The ingredients... so fresh. I can not wait to go back and get one.

Crunch seems like a pretty popular spot in the food court. Steady stream of people during the hour and half I was there. I must say, it is discouraging to look around at the tables and see parents feeding their kids fast food when there's such a delicious and healthy place like this there. 

This will be my new go-to spot to grab grub when I'm shopping at SouthPark Mall. If you see a girl wearing pajamas in the food court, say hi. It'll probably me. I'm pretty sure I'm the only who goes to the mall not dressed to the nines.),(The food here is terrific, especially if you're looking to eat healthier...and let's face it, living in the South we all can benefit from eating healthier every now and then. It's a nice addition to the South Park Mall food court.

I'm a fan of their salads. I have ordered their flatbreads too, which are also good. But if I'm in the mood for a salad and I'm in the area, you can bet that I'll come to Crunch. The menu is laid out nicely and there are plenty of options, including a create your own. The use only the freshest of ingredients. 

The only downside is that if it gets busy and the line gets long you may have to wait a bit. But that's a sign of a good place right?

The price is a bit higher than some of the other food court options, but you get what you pay for here. Quality, tasty, healthy food. It's a must that you check out Crunch if you're in the mall.)"

That being said, the service can be spotty after a game considering the servers are doing their best to, um, cater to the drunkoids on the patio. 

Besides the overall environment, though, I've had some pretty good eats and drinks here. The drinks are pretty standard - full bar and a multitude of brew options (mostly big brand beer here). I have been fairly impressed with their eats, though! The Toasted Ravioli is just smashing before or after you're smashed. This is important, folks - yes, it tastes good even if you're not drinking. I've also enjoyed the Turkey Pita and the delicious berry mayonnaise that accompanies it.

The Good: They offer a pretty nice selection of wine and small bites plus affordable sandwiches and such for lunch or a light dinner. I also saw the chalkboard that showcased a pretty sweet boxed lunch special. They also boast great daily specials that range from $5 glasses to $5 mimosas. The interior is quite cool and definitely interesting. 

The Meh: When hubs and I rolled in on a Thursday evening the service was definitely lacking and fairly aloof. No one told us about the specials (which I would have ordered), welcomed us or told us anything about the place. It was a simple, ""What can I get you?"" They also had the TV (and sound) on, the music on and the lights were super bright at 8:30 pm. At least they muted the TV when we kindly asked if they would. Sensory overload. While they no longer carry the wine I ordered off the menu, the server offered another from the same area. Sure why not. The problem is, it didn't taste nearly like my original choice. Make sure the staff knows what they're selling...

The Bad: The cheese plate. Oh my the cheese plate. I love cheese. Let's just make that clear and the cheese at Wooden Vine is good. Good cheese. The problem? Two small chunks of three cheeses and a pile of ciabatta for hubs and I...$10 and 2 minutes later the cheese was gone and I'm still starvin'. I consciously tried to bite each mini piece of cheese in half so I could extend the life of our cheese but that just didn't suffice. I've had my share of cheese plates in Charlotte and this one really pales in comparison. I took a photo of the cheese plate for reference...

I may come back to Wooden Vine, but I'll definitely check out the scene before I walk in and order something besides the cheese plate...especially if I'm hungry.),(So....I'm not a regular, but feel like it when I show up...some updates......Tuesdays is 1\/2 off bottles!

Despite staying for awhile when it was rather crowded, I never felt rushed. The ambiance was great. Just the right level of lighting. Wooden, but polished and modern.

Good selection of beers including an IPA that I've never had before that was very tasty. Service was decent and friendly.),(After hearing so many praises of delicious and memorable visits, gargantuan burgers, and overall amazement from The Liberty, we finally made it in for a late lunch last week. I had no idea what I was going to order, and after looking at the lunch menu, it seemed that a burger was choice. 

The service was very friendly and appeased my neurotic disdain for the wobbly table on the patio, so we settled for a booth inside. Throughout our meal, our server was very attentive and friendly. 

We started with some of the house-cured pickles and potato chips. Chips - ridiculously good. I've come to appreciate thick cut chips that are made in-house more than fries in the past few months. The pickles were great. Reminded me a lot of a NY halfsour from Stage Deli. Definitely would get those again. 

My wife ordered a veggie sandwich and I ended up ordering the ""Crunch Burger"" which has won a few awards...from Southern Living I think?  The veggie sandwich was pretty standard and fulfilling. Plenty of veg, flavor and sustainability for a vegetarian. The burger....was just a little blah. I appreciate the approach. Especially with the potato chips on the burger, brioche bun, house-ground meat that was cooked to a nice med rare....it just didn't do anything for me. The tomato slice was close to a quarter of an inch thick, a very odd leaf of lettuce jetting out of the side, a small country's worth of pimento cheese, and so much bun....with so little burger. I think it would have been perfect if all of the other toppings had been just a bit smaller in portion. I guess I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to burgers. I appreciate the complex, but love when I can pick up my burger and get a little of everything in one bite. This burger just didn't deliver on that front. 

I can definitely say I'll be back to the Liberty soon. I may venture for something other than a burger, but I look forward to trying more of the menu. Cheers!),(A gastropub it seems like this word has been popping up everywhere lately. I've been asked several times what a gastropub is and to be honest I'm not really sure.

Every gastropub I've been to seems to be very hip. The web definitions vary from a public house, a drinking-establishment of British influence, a bar that serves a higher standard of food then a normal pub. You choose what you want it to mean, anyway you should definitely check one out. Like the Liberty. 

I met a friend of mine for lunch at The Liberty and I thought the food was quite good. We shared the Ashley Farms Chicken Breast with Avocado, Havarti Cheese, Chipotle Aioli. The chicken was grilled perfectly and the roasted red peppers were a great plus. Did I mention the roll it was served on it was so soft and delicious. We also tried the Grilled Shrimp Salad with Bibb Lettuce, Tomato, & Lemon Vinaigrette, now this was pretty plain I think I could have made something better at home. 

I don't want to leave out the crispy french fries though, they were some of the best I've had in town. I would definitely come again for lunch and maybe try dinner they have a great beer selection, and it looks like a fun place to hang out with some friends.),(Went for lunch on our last day on Charlotte. The parking lot was jam packed, but we were able to find street packing near by. We were surprised that the restaurant was empty, so I guess everyone was going to the place next door. Service was prompt and the waitress was friendly. We had some soft pretzels, a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket. Everything was good, but nothing out of this world. For lunch it was nice, but nothing special.),(I've been curious about The Liberty for some time now, and I finally made it in to try some tasty lunch!

I went into this meal with no expectations - I just wanted to give it a try. Hubs and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was just lovely for half of the time, the other half I was covering my ears due to the fire engines leaving the station across the street. No matter though - that's not Liberty's fault!

Liberty is pretty neat inside - a great bar area with plenty of high tops and a main dining room with lots of low, amber-colored lighting and a big kitchen in the rear. I also meandered downstairs where there is a really cool private dining area. Super sweet. 

Anywho, back to my experience. Our server was really sweet and efficient, especially considering we were the only people eating on the patio. I ordered the chicken & dumplings and was quite happy with the bird - crispy skin, plump bird and a small smattering of carrots, mushrooms and a few greens. While I was expecting large dumpling (considering the dumplings part in the description) it came with seven or eight ricotta gnocchi. Now, I love me a gnocchi, and these were indeed delicious, it just wasn't what I was expecting. 

The star of the meal though was my husband's mac 'n cheese - I totally took over that little skillet. It's the baked mac with more cheesy goodness than I ever though possible. Delicious, creamy and topped with a light coating of breadcrumbs. I don't know what types of magical cheese were in this tasty skillet, but I couldn't help myself. 

Overall, a really solid dining experience at The Liberty. I look forward to coming back, especially since it's in my 'hood!),(Three stars is being generous....Y  A  W  N......other than some cheap tricks with the interior design, this place is boring.

If you want to go on the weekends............get a reservation.  During the week it is fine, but as we found out, not worth our time....

So, a few friends of mine went for dinner, but I arrived early and headed to the bar.  They have over 80 beers on their list in both bottle and draft form with some very unique beers priced in the double digits.  But nothing special both in service or decor.

Once my friends arrived, we were seated and purused the menu.  An interesting selection of unique takes on Southern dishes.

We tasted the malt vingar chips...too over cooked, bordering on burnt.  Next was their burger, which ordered medium rare was also burnt on the outside....all of this for pricing in the upper teens????

Service was luke warm for the half empty restaurant.  

1 stars is a fair assessment of this lame establishment.  Save your money........go somewhere else.),(I Came here to celebrate the Queen's Feast, for the first and last time. 

The Liberty was picked by my new co-workers, whom I went with. I was the first person to get there, and the rest of my group arrived within 15 minutes. 
My biggest issue is that our Waitress wasn't super-attentive. She wasn't rude but when I flagged my issue with her, I wasn't satisfied 100% with the resolution. I specifically asked her to pointed out if I order something contains pork. ""The menu is strightforward."" She said. 
I ordered ""Ashley Farm's ""Chicken & Waffles"" - with roasted drunken peaches, arugula, duck-fat waffle and smoked-maple-bourbon-siracha honey."" Thirty minute later, I got my bland waffles topped with bacon!!! Seriously, Liberty ?!! I was hungry, and I had to raised my complaint since I don't eat pork (religious restrictions.) The waitress took my plate and promised to replace it with a new order. Funny enough, she brought out my freshly made chicken & waffles in two minutes. They fried the chicken and baked the waffle in two minutes?! I ended up not eating the chicken, and she said the manager took my drink off the check because the bacon was not mentioned on the menu and it  mistake on their side ( which was nice- I admit!) However, I didn't want a freebie, I want to eat. 

And to be fair, the Salted Caramel Budino and Chocolate Scotch were DELICIOUS. Very very V.E.R.Y DELICIOUS!

Two and Half Yelps),(Great restaurant, wasn't able to actually try the food as there was too many people in line tonight we came. Good news they are able to accommodate large parties so if you have a large group this is a great place to bring your people. 

The location is convenient as it is close to everything downtown. The ambiance was great and it smelled really good. Too bad we weren't actually able to try anything. The staff was nice and the hope hopefully next time for the large party that I came with.

I always get a vegetable plate of some sort. The smoked cheese and pasta salad is one of the best sides you'll find in Charlotte. I switch up my other choices based on my current modd.

They also have different daily specials. Wednesday is chicken pot pie day. I recommend getting there early because they sometimes run out. 

They have a ton of local beers. The Tico sauce- I don't really know what it is, but it's freaking delicious. I put it on everything. There's also a location in Rock Hill and they're opening one in Plaza Midwood. Happy dance.

Or try the Dutch Baby, a huge pancake bowl that needs only lemons and hold the powdered sugar. The pancakes are also rather fluffy and I love the doughyness of them, topped with fresh strawberries and hot syrup.

The place was packed but after a brief wait a table opened up and all of the seats at our table had a view of at least one television tuned into the game.

Duckworth's has the right snacks for watching the game. We had a chicken quesadilla, some boneless wings (two flavors) and a plate of the chicken nachos. The quesadilla and the wings split up nicely but the plate of nachos was insanely huge. A LOT of chips, cheese and chicken on this monster platter. Excavating around the edges worked well because the chicken and ""stuff"" was more inside than on top.

Where Duckworth's wins is their amazingly organized beer list. Sure, some places print stuff out. But no, not this spot. They have iPads for the table that list their beers, provide descriptions and prices. So if you're looking for something different that perhaps you've never had before, this is the spot.

We enjoyed our time. Decent service and way lots of televisions.),(Sensory overload, but in the best way possible. This place is plastered with TVs and has a beer list a mile long. Seriously, if you can't find a beer here you want, well then the problem is you.

The beer menu is on an ipad. You can even search keywords. This makes my quest to drink #allthepumpkin beers much easier. I'm a huge fan of Duckworth's philly cheesesteaks and pizza. I should probably branch out and try other things, but I just can't seem to quit you buffalo chicken philly.

Don't worry, we all made sure that no one was watching those screens.

Service has been kind of hit or miss for me. Saturday our service was fantastic. We watched the Cubs wildcard game here a few weeks ago and it was a cluster. I felt bad for everyone working there because it was obvious they weren't prepared for the crowd.

The beer list is so extensive that they have Ipads for easier navigation. The waitstaff is super friendly and attentive.

We split the caprese - standard, tasty tomato with a hunk of mozzarella and fresh basil, and the farfalle pasta - bow tie pasta with broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, caramelized onions and chicken. While the pasta dish was a little heavy for the hot summer evening, the flavors were great and the large split dish was the perfect amount to keep us full without weighing us down. I really appreciate that our server quite literally split both dishes and gave us our own portions - a really nice touch, especially when we weren't charged a split fee. That only earns them an extra star.

I'll definitely head back to Coco Osteria - if not for a quick lunch then for another experience on the patio with a big ole glass of prosecco!),(Luce for fancy italian...Coco for country provincial....good and hardy....bolangese a bit greasy though.

Food wise: I love the pork wings and all the tacos. I usually always order whatever the egg roll of the week is with my meal. House nachos are great. They're super different and a nice southern twist on a classic bar food. A pretzel and beer cheese are the way to my heart. The Third Ward Special has been one of my favorites since the beginning. I saw someone complain and say they wished it wasn't duck. Well, if you want one that's not duck, go somewhere else. Or better yet, open your own place. Sounds silly right?

Don't get mad if they won't put the Broncos game on for you. Guess what? It's a Panthers bar. And they can't accommodate five different people's requests to see the Broncos, Cowboys, fill in the blank other team that one person wants to watch. College football wise, they are home to Clemson and Michigan State. Don't walk in here on a Saturday and be shocked to see 200 Clemson fans. And again, don't bitch because they have a game day menu. I assume brunch will be back after football season. Two words: MIMOSA BAR. Any place that let's me buy a bottle of champagne and dress it up with a whole bunch of different juices and fruits wins in my book.

Draught has a great event space downstairs. I've attended engagement, birthday, holiday, and even draft (not to be confused with Draught) parties here. It's a good space you can pretty much dress up for whatever occasion. I love the roll up garage doors and patio area as well. Nice spot to grab after work drinks. 

Kudos to the staff. Between setting up tailgates and outdoor areas and dealing with the army of drunk people who wander over after the game, I know gamedays are long days. Thanks for giving Charlotte such a great place to cheer on the Panthers! Rarrrrrrrrr)"

Fleming's inside is lovely, a dimly lit and posh-like restaurant with a lovely bar and comfy seats. Fleming's also has one of the most impressive wine by the glass menus I've ever seen. They have roughly 100 wines by the glass and most of them are fairly priced.

I'll throw it out there right now that our server was friendly but a little distant, as he seemed a bit frazzled with his customers. I can only assume that Restaurant Week certainly made things busy for them. 

On to the food. Here is how it panned out. 

Bread: Fleming's offers two (tasty) spreads, feta cheese spread with chives, roasted red pepper spread. Yum.

Caesar Salad: Super fresh romaine with a healthy amount of Parmesan cheese shavings. However, the dressing was way too anchovy infused for my liking. That's just my preference though and I know that is a traditional Caesar, it was just too strong for me.

*Hubs and I split our main courses when they came to the table to create our own surf and turf. 

Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes*: A generous portion of three jumbo crab cakes set with a side of remoulade. These cakes looked really, really pretty when they were placed in front of me. However, when I dove in I was a little disappointed. They were a bit fishy and a bit bland. I was looking for more spice, more pizazz, more POW. They just didn't do it for me.

Filet Mignon*: A beautiful piece of steak, but it came out a little undercooked for a medium (one side was a little purple-y), but hubs didn't care, he ate that side. While the meat was delicious, it was way over salted - to the point I had to chug down water because of the coarse salt I just rolled over my taste buds. 

Sides: First up, Fleming's Potatoes, the star of the night. A big block of potato stuffed with jalapeno cheese and covered in cheddar cheese. Unhealthy? Oh yes. Delicious? Absolutely. We also ordered the asparagus which was just fine. 

**Hubs and I also split our two desserts. 

Desserts**: Cheesecake with Berry Sauce and Chocolate Mousse. I was delighted that the servers bring out delish Chantilly cream with every dessert. That's a nice touch. Overall, these desserts were good but not great. Nothing really to write home about - the chocolate mousse was a bit bland and one note, and I am a chocolate fiend. However, the cheesecake was rich and well made. 

So, overall, I really wanted to add Fleming's into my steak house rotation, but based on this meal I just don't think it's going to happen. Maybe it was the rush of Restaurant Week or the late dining time we arrived for, but it just didn't live up to its hype. It wasn't a ""bad"" meal, it just didn't knock my socks off.

There are so many other fab steak joints in Charlotte that my taste buds and belly prefer to frequent.),(Meat.  I'm a lover of it and though I haven't eaten at every high end steak place in the city, Flemings was on the short list in the center city.
Fortunate enough to have ""the company"" pick up the check and I along with a few co-workers went off for a nice dinner of cooked almost rare meat....ah!

For me it is always the Filet for these types of places due to the quality and leanness of the meat.  But like other ""well known"" steak places, the sides are also to die for as well.

Service here is top notch, as is to be expected, and doesn't disappoint.  From the time you walk in to the time you leave the servers are trying to make sure you have what you want when you want it and are fast and ready to answer any questions.

Wine selection is very good, though we weren't opening bottles this evening, just ordering by the glass.  

Add in sides like several salad choices along with some great sides (jalapeno cheese spiced potatoes) along with some great desserts (didn't have one but watched a fellow diner indulge in the Cheese cake and she seemed happy.

And though I do have a bit of satisfaction of being able to check this establishment off my list, it certainly doesn't mean I'm not coming back.....because I am *grin*.),(We had a very good experience on this trip. We had a large group and the staff handled it well. I struggled with what rating to give. I do not give out five stars lightly, but I really struggled with a reason to lower it at all.

The decor is like you have come to expect from Fleming's across the country. It is clean, and cool. The staff was attentive and friendly through out the evening. Our server was knowledgable and provided helpful advice on food and drinks.

We started with some wine for the table. Our server made a solid recommendation that was well received by the group. I wish I remembered the name of the wine.

We started with a few appetizers. I tried the Pan-Crisped Pork Belly. The pork belly comes with creamy goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney. Those three components combined for some good flavor.

For my meal I ordered the Main Filet Mignon medium rare. It came out as ordered. The meat was juicy and packed solid flavor. We had several sides for the table as well. As always I ate a lot of Fleming's Potatoes. They are fantastic. I also ate some of the sautéed corn. That was a pleasant surprise. The flavors and textures were very good. The last side I tried was the Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese. It was creamy and tasty. I was far too stuffed to order any dessert.),(This meal could easily qualify as my Last Supper! 

Despite the crowded CIAA weekend, the customer service was excellent! The wait staff was prompt, attentive, and kind. If you are a fan of Ruth Chris and you enjoy steak, chicken, and chops this is a great place that serves above average food! 

I had a blueberry martini done with grey goose and fresh blueberry juice with blueberries at the bottom. A very sweet martini with a clean taste (thanks to the goose). For my entree I ordered the herb roasted chicken, tender and juicy with al la carte sides. The Sauteed Spinach (with a little bit of chipped purple onion) was perfect. It was refreshing to taste a vegetable that does not depend on butter for taste! Macaroni n cheese with leeks. I love a good creamy sharp cheddar cheese sauce! 

My only complaint was that the a la cart sides were not as big as most other places I've been. No fault to Flemings, I'm just being greedy.
But really, the sides are enough for one hungry person, so order two mac n cheese if that is your dish!  

I am also pleased to know that I do not have to wait to go back to CIAA next year for a tasty rematch, there's a Flemings located in Tyson's Corner and in Baltimore. Hallelujah!!!)"

All sorts of great stuff here, including Not Just Coffee. I particularly enjoyed the booth that just sells pickles. I mean, who would think that such a thing could exist but it does. We also picked up an artisan baguette that was perfect with our leftover Italian food. And as a housewarming gift, we bought a beautiful little terrarium. Just way cool.

Only bummer was that NJC was closed promptly at 2:00 on Saturday and the local farmer was out of eggs. Oh well.),(I love Atherton. Such a great little spot to stop by, peruse, ""window"" shop, or even grab some coffee or lunch-ish food. 

There's tons of options. There's a Cast Iron Waffles pop up stand here, Pickleville (they always have samples of different pickles), and per my last visit, there was a stand selling tons of cast iron cookware. I picked up a sturdy and perfectly shaped loaf pan for bread. It's a Lodge which is suuuuper nice. Super cheap, too! Think I got it for less than $20. Big props for the seller using Square to take payment, too. 

There's so much going on in here and it's hoppin' on the weekends. Especially in the earlier hours. I like to stop by after lunch at Luna's in the early afternoons on a weekday. Not too many people then and you can get some one-on-one time with the sellers.),(Check out the new hours, folks! 

I'm a big fan of this sweet farmer's market - a big part because it's so close to home! Literally - it's really nice to be able to walk to a great FM in South End!

You'll find all sorts of local items here: grass fed beef, super fresh produce, gorgeous floral bouquets, pimento cheese, soy candles, baked goodies, jewelry, etc. There really is something for everyone and while some of the vendors do take plastic, know that there is an ATM close by for the vendors who do not. Price wise, most items are very affordable and it's definitely a great feeling knowing that you support local farmers. 

If you didn't remember to bring a reusable bag, you can purchase their very cute (and sturdy) burlap bag for $3 each. 

Visit this market, your body will thank you!),(Take Two!
There is a running joke with my friends, sometimes when my husband comes along he will graciously pay for lunch, cocktails or movies, so they jokingly refer to him as ""the wallet"", so today at Atherton, I brought the wallet with me!!!  Yay!!!!  I bought fresh pickled jalapenos, squash, onions, pimento cheese and potatoes!!!  I didn't have to limit myself to one $5 item like last visit!!!   If you like jalapenos, you have to buy some from the pickle man.  The pimento cheese from Beverly's Gourmet Foods was super yummy too!!!  I love this place.  I might even have to change my current crush to Atherton Mill and Market.  Sorry Jed Steele Lake County Cabernet.  I take that back, I still have my crush on Jed.)"
j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ,"Restaurants, Italian",Charlotte,1,35.309226,-80.749288,Ciro's Italian Restaurant,94,4.0,"(I don't get up to the University area that often, but I've now been to Ciro's twice and overall I've give them 5 stars for service and 3.5 stars for food.

I won't reminisce over the first visit as it was quite some time ago, but hubs and I strolled in there to grab a quick bite before heading to a show in Concord. Our server Colleen was fantastic - she seriously should work at Disneyland because that woman is so happy. She was also incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, making sure that we were in and out of there for our show with plenty of time to spare. 

Beyond the tasty (I presume freshly baked bread), I ordered the cavatelli primavera - an large portion of finely cooked cavatelli pasta loaded with tons of veggies in a light marinara sauce. The pasta was just what I was looking for and the veggies were fresh - my complaint? The sauce was quite bland. Perhaps more crushed red pepper? More garlic? More BAM? Regardless, I had leftover to eat for lunch for another day and for the price, $14.95, it was a ton of food. 

One an alternate note, make sure you note the price of the specials if you're interested in them...hubs and I were both surprised that his chicken & pasta dish was $22. It was roughly the same portion and similar ingredients to my dish and seemed as if the chicken breast cost added $7 to the price. Strange. Regardless, next time I'm  in the University area I definitely want to try their tiramisu - I hear it's phenomenal!),(again, came here as it was within walking distance of our hotel. the restaurant wasn't very full, but service was super slow for our party of 7. i was really excited for the bread after reading the reviews, and i am the type that can kill a whole basket. i could barely eat one. it was dry and tasteless. 

then our side salads took forever and a day to come out. we also asked for extra ice and such, but our waitress never remembered. sigh. the salads finally came and it was a normal salad but good as i hadn't eaten much veggies during my stay. i had ordered the special of the day, pesto chicken (but i substituted for shrimp) florentino. when i was given my dish, it was a alfredo sauce. i pointed out to the server that i had ordered pesto, and she replies, yeah i thought that didnt look right. wow sherlock, since pesto is green! she took it back, and it came out a minute later. i think they just threw some pesto in and mixed it up as it came back way too fast. but regardless, i preferred that than having to eat 10 minutes after all my coworkers dug in. my dish was okay, heavier than i had expected (but maybe i wasnt expecting alfredo with some pesto), but the shrimp were huge and tasty. not as much food as i had thought it would be, which was good. i tried a little of the margherita pizza, and it was not good. it was sooooo soggy on the bottom. yuck. but their pizza portions are huge! tried my coworkers penne vodka, and that was tasty!

again, probably wouldnt come back, but if i did, id probably only order the penne with vodka sauce. to go.),(What do you do when you don't know the area and you have an urging for Italian without the use of a smartphone to go on Yelp? You improvise with the use of primitive 20th Century devices.  Naturally, we used a GPS and found the closest place.  That was Ciros.  What a pleasant surprise.

The waiter was professional, polite and on cue every step of the way with subtle humor as well.  Music live by accordion added nice ambiance to the setting.  The veggie calzone was excellent. The Marsala and marinara were a bit in the sweet side.  We concluded sherry but we didn't confirm.  The tiramisu and canolli were huge.  Over the top huge.  Very much made to be shared.

Overall, we were very pleasantly impressed.)"

Azteca has all the stuff you would want in a Mexican restaurant - Telemundo on the television, burritos and tacos, rice and beans, imported beers from south of the border, chips and salsa, and a wait staff that understands enough English to bring you a carne asada with flour tortillas.

Food is good. Chips are good. Salsa is good. It's A-OK.),(Azteca...sure....why not. I rolled in here on a Saturday afternoon while I was running some errands in the neighborhood. My craving for Mexican was taking over and Yelp led me here. 

Hubs and I were politely greeted and seated in a big 'ole comfy booth. The surroundings are reminiscent of a Chi-Chi's if you've ever had the unfortunate experience of visiting one. Mexican inspired and, well, Aztec-y. The chips were toasty and tasty but the salsa left me a bit sad. No chunks present - just watery blah. But no matter, the guacamole guy came rolling down the aisle and offered us some green magic. We asked for spicy guacamole and it was indeed full of heat...and flavor! My only gripe? For one avocado, the guac price was $7.95...that's steep IMO. 

Onto the entrees...I ordered the enchilada & tamale combo. This option came out on a massive, shallow plate. MASSIVE and covered in sauce and or cheese. Hmph. I *think* the enchilada flavors could have been nice but the cheese dumbed down most of it. The enchilada far superseded the tamale - which was super, duper bland and cakey. The refried beans and rice were standard and nothing to write home about. Meh.

While the service was friendly and efficient, the meal also ended on a sweet note with those crispy cinammon bites with a dab of whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Free little chips of wonder - I could have easily eaten five of them in a snap. Will I head back to Azteca? Perhaps, if I'm in the neighborhood and positively craving Mexican...but I'm not rushing back here anytime soon.),(I was a little wary about this place. From the outside, it looks super sketch because the restaurant is semi-attached to a Days Inn. It's awkwardly positioned to the right of the hotel. But hey, sometimes that's where you get the most authentic food.

Walking in, that's when I realized, it was very cultured and decked out. I felt like I walked into an Aztecan temple filled with golden chairs\/walls\/tables, you name it. It may have been the color of the wood and the light that was shining just right. I felt like I needed to offer a human heart in return for my food. But we'll save that for another time ;)

The menu, like any traditional mexican restaurant was expansive. Average price around $7-12, so pretty good. I think there were over 60 items on the menu. I ultimately chose the Avocado Tostada and an enchilada. My friend got 2 tacos and an enchilada. While we were waiting for our food, the chips and salsa came out. Chips were the same as any mexican restaurant, however the salsa came with two different types: a cabbage blend and the regular salsa. The cabbage salsa was unique and sweet. Usually cabbage is bitter but it was rather pleasant. We also ordered some queso to go with the chips. 

I would say the only caveat about this place was the service. It was a bit slow and forgetful. We ordered the queso and we didn't receive it until we got our meal (which was 20 minutes after we ordered). Water refill was slow if not at all (we had to hail down our waiter). Let me tell you though, it was alot of queso, so definitely your money's worth. When we got our food, it was served on this gigantic plate (~20 inches wide). The food was spread out, but it was still alot of food. Avocado tostada was a bit disappointing as I only got 2 small chunks of avocado.

Regardless, the experience was amazing. We got sopapillas at the end. It's essentially fried chips with a sprinkle of strawberry drizzle and powdered sugar. Nice way to polish off the lunch. Til next time amigos.),(I'm trying to think of anything I dislike about this place and I cant.  The guacamole the woman with the cart makes is great, the queso dip is great, all the food I've had is great.  My personal favorite is the ""Dos Amigos"" chicken and shrimp in a sour cream sauce oh my god and if you want to get the real deal ask for the handmade corn tortillas.  If I could eat here every day I probably would, and then I wouldnt fit through the door.

Also, I came here on my birthday and they brought me ice cream and sang me happy birthday while banging on drums.  Way better than red lobster.)"

A young man rang me up and I asked him is there lettuce and tomato on the falafel, remembering Julia S said she wanted more on her sammiches.  So I was being slick and ordered extra lettuce and tomato on mine and I ordered a side of tabouli.   


Jerusalem's tabouli was good, it was exactly how I like it, dry, not wet with oil and more parsley than bulghar. YUM!

The falafel I thought was average, I have had much better, but it was only $2.99, so for $3 I don't even want to complain. There was no lettuce on mine, good thing I asked for extra!!!  It was garnished with tomato and pickle only.    I got two sandwiches and a side of tabouli for $10.

We wanted someone inexpensive and easy, so as we walked past Vapiano and Yelped it, we decided to pop in.

Interesting concept I've not seen before. Sort of cafeteria style in that you go and get your own food, but it's cooked right in front of you to order. When you order, they scan your RFID card and then when you leave, they tally up from that what you had to eat and drink. I would imagine that this place is a crazy madhouse during the lunch rush, but late in the evening, it was pretty quiet and peaceful.

I let my wife hold down the table while I went and got two plates of pasta for us. Chicken alfredo and a meat-filled ravioli. As mentioned earlier, everything is made right to order and you can watch the guy mixing it up as he does it. You want more garlic, less tomatoes? Done.

Oh, and the pasta? Yeah, they make all of that on site too so it's really fresh and not dried out like the stuff you might get in the store.

It was excellent option for late dinner and we'll absolutely be back.

Tip: Try the olive oil for dipping your bread. They've put red pepper flakes in it for a nice little zing.),(Considering how nicely decorated and *huge* Vapiano is, it has some major potential. I've seen reviews across the board and while I definitely gave Vapiano a fair shot, I was very underwhelmed. 

The Good: It really is a beautiful place with a gorgeous bar, low key dining tables with fresh potted herbs and a super convenient location if you live\/work Uptown. The host and cooks were friendly and informative overall. I didn't have a problem with the swipe cards, although I kept a close eye on my own! 

The Meh: The prices were a tad bit high in my opinion, but I'd be fine with them if the quality matched the price tag. I'm not a huge fan of this concept, in general. If I am going to shell out $30 for pizza and salad, I'd at least like a bit of table service. 

The Bad: The food. Sorry. I didn't really enjoy anything that I ordered\/tasted - details below. Also, I was a bit peeved when I couldn't get a tiramisu (stationed at the bar) to go. I understand they are made in rocks glasses, but please offer a bit of customer service and check if they can be made in a transportable vessel. I imagine they'd sell a ton more, too. 

-Pomodoro e mozzarella pizza: 2\/5: Total snoozefest. The pizza was lukewarm, limp, a bit soggy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella wasn't melted at all and there was zero crisp to the crust. Even the basil looked sad. I had to pile on the crushed red pepper and parmesan to get through it. 

-Side house salad: 1\/5: Looks like bagged salad mix and the house dressing had a super funky aftertaste to it.

-Side Caesar salad: 3\/5: This broke my heart because the dressing, croutons, parm shards, and romaine had major potential. Taste was spot on, if a bit thick. However, my poor lettuce was positively drowning in dressing. 

The best part of my meal here? The gummy bears on the way out.),(I was in town recently and thought I would try this place one more time.......without the drama of the X basket dropper

Now I'm not suggesting to get mini shrimp and reduce the portions, I mean we like fried shrimp, but it was somewhat of an odd combination.  At least they get kudos for trying something new. 

The calamari we got was not crispy as we expected but it tasted pretty good.  One person in our group wasn't too crazy about the soy wrapping around one of the sushi rolls, I've had it before so I thought it was fine and liked it.  They pump out some good sized rolls here which is nice, but overall I felt it didn't have that ""umami"" factor - - something that sets them apart from the rest.  It was more on the bland side than what I'm used to, and none of the sushi rice was warm or had that slight hint of rice wine vinegar which is what I'm used to when my Tokyo Mother makes the Real McCoy.  

Service was solid, drinks filled promptly, and we used a restaurant.com coupon which made it a more reasonable affair.  With all the sushi places in town I'll probably give others a try first before coming back here again, and overall I'd say ""A-OK"" is an accurate account of our experience here.  But don't take it from us - - try it yourself since no one sushi palate is the same.)"

To borrow a phrase from Tracy Jordan, I want to get Dim Sum pregnant. It's a great place to go in the odd time in the middle of the day when you don't know if restaurants take a siesta, they are open straight through. 

They also have house made soy sauce, be sure to ask for some.  I am fine with only ordering dim sum, but my friends wanted some Chinese food too, I was like.... well, how I always am.  Order away!  We had some house fried rice and Szechuan beef, both were pretty darn tasty. This restaurant is everything I love, it's the kind of restaurant you drive by and wonder what it's all about and then you try it and you can't think of any place else..),(I like Dim Sum Chinese. 

It can definitely use a makeover. Not necessarily the cleanest, nicest digs. And the day that we went, we got there soon after it opened...thus, we were the only ones in attendance and thus, the energy was a little low in there. 

So I cannot accurately describe the service, other than to say that they were very attentive to us :) But I hear that it gets super busy on the weekends and that it's a completely different vibe in there. 

But ultimately you want to know about the food right? 

The food was pretty good. To be honest, we really enjoyed the various dishes that we tried. The dumplings seem to come to mind as I write this. Pork and shrimp dumplings were excellent.

The prices are very reasonable. If you give it a shot, I think you'll like it!)"

My buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese. 

When in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing. 

I have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili....),(Goodness gracious, do I love Lupie's. 

This place is a Charlotte staple for sure. Talk about a great dive with tons of history. 

Nice and simple menu with a couple choices of burgers and a few different kinds of chili. Let me say, the chili is what will keep you coming back. The choices are variations of Cincinnati, Southern and Texas style Chili. All have their strong points and are even good when mixed together. The only one I can't truly appreciate is the Cincinnati style. Sweetness in my chili is just a bit weird as a dyed in the wool southerner. 

Sweet tea. You've gotta get Lupie's sweet tea. Sweetened to perfection and they give it to you in a mason jar with the best crushed ice in the world. A perfect pairing for your chili of choice. 

The burgers are great, too. I haven't ventured into the world of burgers too much, but what I've had has been memorable. 

The parking lot can be a little tricky. If you're going at peak lunch hours, good luck. It's a bit cutthroat to find a space. Also, getting back out on to Monroe can be a bit of a challenge, so beware. 

This place is awesome. Love it for lunch or a date night with my wife. Actually went to this place with wife the night we decided to get married! Such a great memory. 

Keep doing exactly what you've been doing all these years, Lupies. 

Perfect.),(Ahh Lupie's....this place can cure a hangover with their super sweet tea, and ridiculous portion of Nachos. The Chili Nachos are very tasty, I was not impressed by the burger though it was pretty bland and I've had better. 

The veggies all seem to be from a can but I did enjoy my homemade chicken and dumplings, they were some of the best I've had in town. 

The atmosphere is awesome, dark and relaxing. The service is always outstanding. Though it's not my first choice when I'm hungry, you would definitely need to try it out for yourself.),(The mashed potatoes here are delicious. They only serve them on Mondays so if you're dying to try them, you'll have to go then. After debating between a few different items, I went with the special of meatloaf with a side of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. You get a lot on your plate for very little money.  Lupie can be seen hard at work in the kitchen. Service was okay. They are not shy about filling your glass up. I asked for a ""little"" more on my refill and they filled it up completely. The wait to get in tends to get long quickly so I recommend going at a non-peak hour if you can. They definitely earned a ""People love us on Yelp"" sticker which is proudly displayed in the window here.)"

I absolutely love this pop up soda shop. It's operated out of an old VW bus that owner Greg completely restored himself. He put a lot of work into it. The story behind it: his wife Kara is three years sober and was tired of not having a decent non-alcoholic alternative when she went out with friends. Her dream: to start a business with a family friendly setup that didn't include booze as the main selling point. Boom. Nailed it. 

The menu is made up of handcrafted sodas, floats, and sundaes. They make all of the soda syrups with natural ingredients and fresh fruits. Flavors change with the seasons. They use locally made ice cream for the sundaes. The items have a lot of fun names- Taking Back Sundae (see what they did there) and Unicorns Do Exist. That one is absolutely adorable with an upside down cone for a horn. Your kids will want one. I've sampled a little bit of everything from here and I'm a huge fan of it all. 

Check their website or follow them on the social medias (the 'gram, the 'book) to see their schedule each week. They also do private events. If you see the bus, make sure to stop by and say hi!)"

I frequent there often, and it's a favorite among my group of friends. 

The crowd is great if your looking for a group of young professionals in a casual atmosphere. Skee ball, pool, corn-hole, outdoor seating, and karaoke are among the activities you will find here. The food is great just don't order the deviled eggs, sounds like a good idea but is definitely not a menu item you should order I think at any restaurant. 

I tried the chicken pita the other night and I have a craving for it already. Grilled chicken in a warm pita topped with a handful of french fries, and tzatziki  yum. 

All in all this is a great place to hang with a crowd.....and I almost forgot they serve beer in a mason jar!),(Sometimes it's just nice to belly up to a bar or a long table and take in some scary bad karaoke and dine on some tasty bar bites. So, for these intents & purposes, Jackalope Jacks fills the void. And it fills it well, too, if I may add. 

A few yelpers and I dropped by Jack's after a OYE just down the street. Many of these fabulous yelpers had already had their fair share of al-co-ma-hol, so they were already in great spirits when we arrived. What I became privy to was a few bits of fabulousness:

1) Jackalope Jack's dishes out a pretty tasty gyro. Similar to Showmars style if that's what you dig. 

2) Tater tots FTW. Definitely get the tots - they are delish. Just ask Jay R. - he ordered two baskets full of them, plus 14 PBRs. But that's another story completely. 

3) The karaoke is pretty hysterical. Yeah, you'll hear a few folks who can actually sing, but it's the experience of hearing those who cannot sing that really makes this a gem. 

I haven't been here when it's super low key, but I imagine it's a solid bar to grab some grub and hear some random dude sing I'm Too Sexy...which is even more inappropriate when he's in a priest getup and humping the microphone. Here's hoping that's only during Halloween weekend...),(Been here a number of times. It's a fun place to bring a group and have a drink. They have karaoke certain nights and bar games like darts, billiards, mini basketball hoops. Lots of tvs showing games, etc. The bar\/waitstaff is really friendly and they have a good selection of drinks. You can even sit outside if you'd like.

I was reluctant to write a review about this place for months because I realized that I hadn't actually had a meal here yet, and I wanted to incorporate that into my review. Well I'm happy to report that I had a meal there last week and it was really good. I went with my softball team after a loss and our group's orders had a little bit of everything. Needless to say, we were well pleased with the food offerings. The prices for food and drinks were very reasonable as well. 

It gets pretty crazy busy here on weekends, so if you're not into that, you might want to check it out on a weeknight. Other than that I like this place a lot.)"

I can't really point fingers, because once I found a seat then that's exactly what I did for about two hours. After the lunch hours, some of the drip coffees are prepared to order. No worries, I like a fresh cup so it was better than usual.

With a dozen or so people surfing the Internet, it was a bit slow.

As for the wedding planner and assistant who came in to meet a bride and her maid of honor to discuss the upcoming nuptuals, without buying a coffee, that's just wrong. At least the Korean lady helping a couple with their taxes (yes, this happened) bought a drink!),(This location has a nice feel inside to sit and relax. The store is large with a variety of seating options inside and outside. There's community tables (don't hog it ;)) and the employees are friendly. The parking lot can be really full so finding a spot is sometimes a hassle. The line was about 5 deep but I figured it would move along fine.

The reason for my A-OK star rating is the service time and drink quality. It took 25 minutes from the time I got in line to the time I got my drink... 25 minutes! I timed it! I ordered the Tall  Zombie Frappuccino (I know, don't judge :) all good fun) and it was over $5.00! ""Ok wow but it's seasonal and so insta-worthy,"" I thought.

After I paid I was told they were out of the ""brain"" (pink) whipped cream which is what makes it look so fun... The girl was nice about the whole situation but I would have felt a lot better about the 25 minutes, half-assed drink if they would have offered me a drink coupon for next time. The managers here could help their customer base with training on how to read the customer's situation and assess their frustration levels.

I send a response on the Starbucks App and got a quick refund to my card which was nice, thats why theres 3 stars instead of 2 cause I know you're wondering why I would even give 3!

I was looking for something outside the usual to show my mom the range of eateries in Charlotte and Intermezzo hit the buttons for different. Serbian. And close to uptown for a look at the lights.

Greeted warmly, we took a table inside. Not the widest menu, but the choices were excellent.

We started with the garlic twists. Excellent choice - light and fluffy with a marinara sauce to dip in. All gone! For the mains, since my mom is a veggie, she had the vegetarian lasagna and really enjoyed it. I went with the stuffed cabbage and wow, it was excellent. Thick cabbage leaves with a spicy (not hot spicy, this is tasty spicy) ground beef and rice mix in a broth that was served with a loaf of homemade bread. I used up all the bread to soak up the fab broth.

For dessert, we went with the fruit stuffed crepes. Fresh (not frozen) strawberries and banana slices with a hazlenut chocolate drizzle.  There was some fighting involved for the last bit.

Interesting beer choices, I had a Belgian wheat beer that was excellent.

Strong recommendation! Great food, nice ambiance!),(Pizza plus old world Serbian fare? That equation may sound odd, but it feels so right. And delicious. 

I think I've had almost everything on the menu. It's all pretty good. Their pizza is some of my favorite in Charlotte. I like both the Capriccioso and Intermezzo Supreme. App wise, the bruschetta is great. I love how the housemade Mozzarella is melted over the tomatoes. Portabella mushroom tower is yummy as well, just note that it's a smaller size starter. The shopska is a good salad-like option to share. The eggplant musaka and cabbage rolls are delicious. I think the Piroska is a hidden star on this menu. It's kind of like stuffed pizza or calzone type dish. I always add spinach to mine. 

You can order online via their website for pick up or delivery. They do half priced wine on Wednesdays. The patio has a nice view of the skyline. Gah, our city is so pretty. 

I've known Branko and Djordje since back in their days of working at Cosmos a decade ago. They are hard workers, take a lot of pride in what they do, and are just great people in general. So proud of them and all they are doing at Intermezzo.),(Don't be fooled by the sign reading ""Pizzeria and Cafe"" on the outside of Intermezzo's flavor-filled walls. There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight. 

The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime! 

Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous. 

So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness. 

Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg. 

Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more? 

This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place. 

If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!),(Ahh Intermezzo your 1\/2 price martini's on Sat.

This restaurant is such a great find the staff is very friendly the place is small but has a great outdoor seating area when the warmer weather arrives you'll find me here.

Let's talk about food as suggested by fellow yelpers i went for the beef burek delicious the homemade phyllo dough was unbelievable.  Make sure to order some apps the corn dip and goat cheese crostini's were a big hit. I can't wait to get back and try some pizza!),(I can honestly say that I think this is the first time I've had Serbian food. And I'm a fan, thanks Intermezzo! 

Not only does Intermezzo have a great patio, with plenty of fans mind you, they sport a cozy interior and a really unique menu of pizzas and Serbian items I haven't indulged in before. I popped in here for a quick lunch with a friend and while I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich, I had a severe case of food envy when I saw my friend's dish come out - the ground beef burek. It looked like a pretzel roll and a beef slider had a baby. And she was quite pleased with it too!

Onto my sandwich, two pieces of delicious crusty bread hugged wood fired squash, portabella mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes. The best part though? The incredible goat cheese spread that was thinly layered beneath the veggies - I would like that in a cup, please. I chose the roasted potatoes as my side - nice and toasty, with a pleasant crisp. Prices and service were both friendly and I definitely want to head back and try a myriad of their Serbian dishes. And maybe a pizza. Times two.),(Not my piece of pizza. 
I had some company at my place and we had craving for pizza. Since I'm still not familiar with charlotte yet, it was suggested we try Intermezzo Pizzeria. 
We ordered two large pizzas, the Wood Grilled Fungi and the Chicken Florentine. Personally, I wasn't satisfied. I prefer my pizza, to be real Italian style with a twist of risen and light crust- just a personal preference!

On another note, here are some facts about Intermezzo:
- It has been serving Charlotte for 10 years. 
- Handmade dough and mozzarella. 
- Hand-tossed pizza
- Traditional Serbian dishes
- They deliver to Uptown, Elizabeth, and the Plaza-Midwood areas!

I now see that those were five empty useless boring years without bergushi. Skip the rest of the paragraph if you don't want mushy details. I wanted to come here. I really did. But I wanted to bring my wife. When I told her burger sushi, she sort of flipped out. No, no, no. So instead, my daughter kinda surprised her and brought her here. And now, she's a fan.

Arriving after the lunch hour and before the dinner hour, we were brought to a table immediately. My understanding is that this is quite rare and you can usually wait for a table during the busier times. Our waiter was friendly, almost a bit over the top, but that's just me.

We had a plate of the calamari to start. A very large portion here. Really enough for three to share as a starter.

For main, I went right to the classic bacon double cheese bergooshi. It was very very good, though next time I would drop the yellow mustard. Bite size pieces of burger rolled in rice paper served with excellent shoestring fries. Amaze!

My dining partner chose one of the bento boxes and there is a serious amount of food there with a sushi roll, sweet potato fries, cucumber and onion salad, edamame and a slider. Wow.

Good service, excellent food, really creative menu. Yes, they have regular sushi and they have regular burgers. And they have other stuff too.

Looking forward to returning!),(I absolutely love this place. I'm not really sure how anyone couldn't fall in love with Cowfish. They have it all. Sushi, burgers, milkshakes, sake... they even have fried pickles! Yes, a sushi joint has fried pickles and they are damn good. 

First thing you need to know: there will be a wait on Friday and Saturday nights. A long wait. At least an hour. You may even wait on a week night. Scope out the bar. Grab a spot if you see one. Or, put your name on the list and walk somewhere else to have a cocktail or shop while you wait. They do not take reservations. 

Specials: 
Mondays- 1\/2 price cocktails
Tuesdays- 1\/2 price martinis
Wednesday- 1\/2 price bottles of wine
Thursday- 1\/2 price sake

The food: you can't really go wrong with anything here. There's a TON of options on the menu. You may get overwhelmed looking at it. Take a deep breath and dive in to the deliciousness.  I love to order the fusion specialty bento box. I go with whatever the slider of the day is. The sides are delicious. My favorite is the cucumber salad.

Apps: do you like crab rangoon? ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON DIP. It's a deconstructed crab rangoon and it's delicious. It's worth noting again... the fried pickles are damn good. Big Al's Yellowtail, Tuna Nachos, parmesan truffle fires... all fantastic. Your biggest problem here may be narrowing down your order. 

Super unique and always worth the wait. This is a great spot for girls night or date night. I love to bring out of town guests here.),(It had been a while since I'd ventured into The Cowfish. Their long waits make it somewhat of a standoff for hungry Southpark goers. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were astonished at how fast we were seated. They make it happen here. 

Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.

First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass! 

For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries. 

Entrees:

My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalapeños. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat. 

I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!

The Cowfish is worth anyone's time. Charlotte native, visitor, what have you, you need to stop in and sample their vast menu. Service is professional, fast and friendly. Warning: be prepared to wait on busy nights! That patio is hot to trot in the Southpark scene. Get in there fast!

Cheers!),(Thank you Cowfish for supporting us yelpers...I had a great night checking this place out. This restaurant has taken over the old ""Counter"" in Southpark. The concept is genius gourmet burgers & sushi. 
The fusion dishes are one of a kind. I even saw a bento box served with sushi rolls and beef sliders - that rocks. 

You no longer have to worry about where to go the next time your in the mood for sushi and your friend doesn't eat raw fish. This is the place. 

Be prepared for a wait it was freakin packed last night. I sampled a pimento cheese slider and a very strange sushi with pesto, mozzarella and some other stuff. The burger was delicious - but this particular sushi was a little strange for me but unique I give them that. 

I decided I was still hungry and with the crazy selection on the menu I just had to try a few more things. Ahi Tuna Nachos oh my gosh yes I will be coming back for these on a regular basis this appetizer was huge and.could definitely be a meal. Crab rangoon dip on top of wonton chips with guacamole and blackened rare ahi tuna come on people this was heaven. I also tried what we were told was the most popular roll on the menu the Marx roll it was tasty not my fav but the pieces were huge and it was all prepared very well. 

Special thanks to our servers Kevin and Fallon (sorry I'm pretty good with names I hope that's right) you all were very patient and full of information always appreciated.),(This place has not disappointed and today's was apparently really really good (I'm on a diet).  The all American double cheese burgushi is a cheeseburger in the form of a roll.  It potato strings  wrapped around  ground beef and rice and cheese.   He had shark eyes (u know where they roll back when they are in a frenzy eating).  Also had the bento box that just has so much food its just not fair.   The cucumber salad was really good and he also had shark eyes.  Last was just a staple California roll but she said it was delish.  Shark eyes all around.),(In an alternate universe there will be more crazy fusion restaurants like this...fried chicken and pie...lasagna and hibachi...mole and milkshakes...ok maybe not. BUT, Cowfish does bring together two of my favorite foods - sushi and burgers and does them both surprisingly well!

Since I've only snacked on hubs' burger, I'll focus my review on apps and sushi. Let's get to it...

1) The scene: Super cool looking restaurant - very pop art-ish with custom sushi\/Warhol esque paintings scattered on the red walls. Also, a huge bar and overall big concept (they took the Counter's space & the old Grape space - this place is magnanimous). Tons of tables in the bar area and general dining space. Make a reservation - it shall save you time! 

2) The staff: Sharp, knowledgeable and friendly on both accounts I've sat down for a meal here. They are able to walk you through the gigantic menu and help you focus on a few things that catch your eye. 

3) The menu: Huge. I mean Cheesecake Factory huge. Almost bordering on so large and detailed you can't take it all in. Think apps, burgers, burgushi, traditional sushi, creative sushi, make your own sushi, milkshakes, desserts, oh my. 

4) The food: De-freakin'-licious. A few things I've really enjoyed here...
-Crab Rangoon dip: Just as you would imagine, but better. Not for the dieting kind: fried wonton crisps, drizzled with sauce and dunkable in the crabby rangoony dip. Yes, please.
-Tropical Storm Roll: super fresh, delicious and huge. *Word to the wise, if you want to actually fit a piece of a sushi roll in your mouth, ask them to cut the rolls into 10 pieces instead of 8. Trust me...your jaw will thank me.
-Mango Tango Roll: Yummmm. I love just about anything with mango and this creative mixture is delightful. Plus - jalapeno! Nom.
-Fried pickles: Tasty and crunchy with a delicious dipping sauce. 
-White Diamond: Normally I shy away from panko, flash fried rolls but this is pretty flavorful! I may ask for a bit more heat next time, too. 

5) The prices: Honestly, pretty reasonable prices considering how much food you get to indulge in! Plus, the.sushi.rolls.are.huge. And the apps are pretty generous in size. Sharing is caring...share a few rolls with friends, you'll have plenty of food to go around. 

I also noticed that their lunch menu looks pretty slammin' and reasonable! So that's my long winded review of Cowfish. I really adore this chic fusion eatery and can't wait to go back!),(It was my last meal in Charlotte this go 'round, after another extended 5-day weekend visiting my parents, and I knew I really wanted something different before leaving. Having eaten my fill of Southern style specialties while staying at home with them, my radar began blinking frantically when I did a quick search for new (relatively) places in Charlotte since my last visit. Having worked in the area for many years selling wine I had already been to most of the more unique spots in the city, and then I stumbled upon what surely had to be a typo...The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar? Ummm, what? Then, my mind flashed to my last trip here over Christmas and some shopping that was done at South Park mall. I recalled riding past a place with a burger and sushi on the awning, and my immediate reaction at the time was a similar ""what the hell?"" Well, nothing more had to be said. I didn't even have to pull up the menu to know this would be my destination for lunch.

When we arrived at our destination, which you would likely never find if you weren't specifically looking for it, it was a bit past prime lunch hours (somewhere between 1 and 1:30), but the restaurant was still surprisingly hopping for a Monday afternoon. I passed up the chance to eat outside, as you have no idea what the patio space looks like upon entering. This was a mistake, not because the inside was bad, but because after I saw the nice large patio adjacent a beautiful fountain I really wanted to be eating out there. Sitting inside did offer a vantage point of the strange and humorous wall art, half mocking half embracing the fusion of burger and sushi, along with an enormous fish tank and easy access to our server. A quick trip to the restroom revealed another of Cowfish's oddities, a foreign language ""learn to speak Japanese"" track playing, combined with what could only be described as ""learn to speak Redneck"" version. Hearing the cute little J-pop voice followed by Cletus was certainly a shock, and I made another visit before leaving just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating (and I had to rinse an obscene amount of grease from my beard).

The real reason for coming here though is obviously the strange mix of food offered on the enormous menu. First are the appetizers, some of the best meal starters I've seen offered. This isn't your typical ""hey let's fry something or add cheese to it"" type of appetizer. They're all well thought out and incorporate a breadth of flavor profiles. Then you've got a page full of burger options, followed by several pages of very creative sushi rolls, and finally their signature item, a combination of burger and sushi they've deemed burgushi. It sounds like something the bumbling idiot Fabio from Top Chef would pronounce, but the concept is actually quite appealing when you see the menu descriptions.

I began with a couple appetizers, hoping my mom would assist me in eating them so I would have room for a burger, and the ""Mother Load"" roll, which features a piece of every fish on their menu in one hell of a creative presentation. I wound up eating both of them by myself though, so I had to cut out the sushi. I started with the blackened Ahi tuna nachos, which are wonton chips topped with crab Rangoon dip, pico de gallo and avocado and some seared tuna. I thought the quality of everything in this item was superb, although the crab dip definitely overtook the flavor of the tuna. It really benefitted from just a few drops of added Sriracha to help balance all the flavors. Next up I dove into the Caribbean summer rolls, which have boiled shrimp, lettuce, mint, mango, cucumber and chive, and when combined with their spicy peanut sauce they were actually some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, anywhere. The size was huge too, definitely worth the $9 price tag if you're debating which appetizer to order.

In between the appetizers and our burgers came the only real faux pas of the meal by Cowfish, and that was actually delivering our burgers just minutes after our appetizers had arrived. I had eaten literally one and a half of the big nachos, and not even begun on the rolls, when both our burgers were brought out. I decided not to complain and just go along with it, mixing bites from everything at once, but then I bit into my burger and realized that the medium rare I had requested was actually medium well, and produced no juice whatsoever. This I had to say something about, and it was promptly remedied by the chef, and comp'ed off the ticket by the manager. 

1) Businesses take note, that's how you take care of a customer. 
2) Yelpers take note, that's how you correct an error without bitching about it and deducting stars.

As for the actual burger, I went with the Arnold Hamandegger (self explanatory), and when properly done was wonderfully juicy, with just the right amount of egg yolk seeping over the bacon and ham. The ""Cowfish sauce"" was pretty tasty too, and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly.),(Had a business lunch here - I had the Tuna Nachos - or whatever the heck they call them! In any case, you get large strips of lightly seared tuna on chips with an Avocado and something else that is like a nicely spicy Aioli - made for a nice lunch time snack (after eating a rather large and filling breakfast earlier in the day).

The decor in the place is cool and quirky!

Service was excellent! I'd love to come back here again and try most everything else on the menu!),(Cowfish is awesome. Whenever my wife and I have out of town visitors, we always take them here at least once. Everything here is great. The burgers, the sushi, the ribs, ALL GOOD! It's cool enough to come here to just hang out and have drinks (which I have). The food is terrific. The milkshakes are awesome. The portions are huge. The waitstaff is great. Super attentive and friendly. The bartenders are really cool too and have great stories. The only downside is that it's so popular that there's usually a long wait on weekends. But that's alright.),(Felt like a lab rat... squeezing down two clogged lanes of rush hour traffic on 85, from Raleigh, and winding my way around the convoluted, impossible, multi-level, sprawling-across-intersections layout that is Southpark Mall. I finally called Cowfish to get a better bead on their location, and found them (eventually). The place was packed on my arrival, but they have quite a large horseshoe bar, and I was able to find a seat on the end. 

The former Yelp CLT CM used to post Cowfish food porn pics, and they always looked awesome. And when I heard Cowfish was coming soon to Raleigh, I wanted to get a scoop on what to expect...

The idea of burger-sushi fusion is intriguing... but after my long drive, and looking over the burg-ushi, etc. options, I decided I wasn't feeling up to ordering something I might not enjoy. They have quite a long list of burgers and sushi rolls, which makes this restaurant concept kind of cool, because it's a place that will please anyone; it actually occurred to me I could take my non-sushi-eating parents there if I ever had a raw craving. I started with nigiri (white fish and yellowtail) and sake. Then followed that up with the Chef roll, which was large and tasty. All rolls can be made with brown rice for an extra fee.

Despite being busy, service was fast and attentive. The bar area has touch games built into the surface, which is neat-o. My biggest problem was the sticker shock. My drink, two pieces of nigiri, roll, and tip ran me ~$40, which is a lot to spend considering there's equally high-quality fish available for less where I live. Compelling concept, but not sure I'd be the one to suggest it, unless organizing a group get-together of varying palate preferences.),(Sushi and burgers, what else can want?

Decor and ambiance were whimsical and fun.

I got the fusion bento box which consist of the Mini burger of the day, 4 pc Nigiri Sushi, cucumber salad, edamame, and sweet potato fries. 16

The mini burger was definitely the star. everything else worked well together. I was really full by the end of the meal. Alas I have to get use to eating sushi and burgers at the same place. I prefer to have sushi night and burger night on separate days.)"

After hearing rave reviews about Del Frisco's it was about time I tried this place out for myself.  Let's start with the scenery the restaurant is beautiful two floors in a wide open space and a great bar area.  We lucked out with a really great corner booth and a great waitress. For me it's not an every night dinner kind of place only because I could never afford it, but for a great date this is the place to go. 

I ordered the filet and au gratin potatoes each plate came out hot and were cooked perfectly.  A dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives oh yeah.   Del Frisco's is a great treat if your looking for somewhere really nice for dinner I would put this place in my top 5.),(Went to celebrate a birthday so we were perhaps setting expectations too high.  One person in our group had dined before and thought it was good.  I had the 8 oz filet and it was too peppery.  The prime rib cut was very tough and had the marbling that was actually too tough, even difficult to cut thru.  The scallops were good but my with started to get a bit overwhelmed with the sweetness in the mushrooms that had too much Asian teriyaki sweetness.),(Restaurant Week Review

Del Friscos is beautiful. Make reservations, they fill up quickly. We snagged a table about 3 hours before we stopped in no problem, but it does fill up by 6:30pm. 

They synchronize their hostesses in an all black uniform... and blonde hair. You heard it, blonde hair. Our waitress Rachel was very nice and the 2 boys at my table approved.

Wine. There are 2 huge lists but they have affordable ones that start at around $30.

Bread: Mortons-style. There is one huge, round piece of sesame crusted white bread in the center of the table that you can rip pieces from. The butter is whipped. 

8 ounce fillet: YUM YUM YUM. So delicious.

Chateau Potatoes: Decent. 

Garlic Broccoli: Their special side of the day. Very good garlic broccoli. 

Chocolate Mousse: Very chocolatey, smooth, and generously portioned!

Strawberry Cheesecake: It's a lighter version of a cheesecake, not as dense. I kind of prefer the dense Cheesecake Factory style NY cheesecake =X 

Great meal for a great price. I'm so glad I came for Restaurant Week!)"

I tell him that is great, but I have to go and want my money back..............he proceeds to again tell me...they are making it right now.

How many guys does it take at Five Guys to fu*k up an simple hamburger order...........punchline.......all of them.  Unfortunately, another Epicenter establishment drops the ball.  Will this ever end? *grin*),(I stumbled upon this place while looking for the CVS. I am not prone to go for a burger joint, but it was late and I was hungry. 

I ended up ordering the grilled cheese. What?! At a burger joint? Yes, I know. I also ordered the fries -- the Cajun fries. 

Five Guys is very generous with their fries. Like, seriously. Which is kind of nice because after eating the serving from the designated cup, I still had some at the bottom of the bag. Ah, bliss. 

The Cajun spice was nice -- and not at all overdone. These are not the type of fries that cause your lips to curl into your mouth. Not salty, but spice-filled. But not hot, for those of you concerned about too-spicy food. 

But this is the kind of food that leaves you feeling guilty after eating it -- but not in that slimy, greasy kind of way. Just in the overindulgent kind of way. Maybe it was the fries. 

The grilled cheese was nicely...well, grilled. And there was a hint of something I could not figure out. Something slightly sweet either in the cheese or in the sourdough. I couldn't figure it out. It wasn't like straight sugar -- maybe cane sugar or brown sugar slipped into the dough? Very tasty. But, funny: The sandwich was rather small. Smaller than a fist. But, all the same, it was delicious and, along with the fries, quite filling.)"

For appetizers we ordered a dozen oysters and the fried cheese recommended by the server.  However, server came back and said they ran out of the fried cheese.  The oysters were good.

For my entree, I had the daily special of clams & linguine.  It was average.

The weird part is when a member of our party attempted to order a beer.  The first beer he attempted, they told him they ran out.  The second beer, they said they were out of glasses.  What?

It's difficult to find a spot in Charlotte that will take reservations for Sunday brunch - but Providence Cafe welcomes them. This is mighty helpful as the church crowd positively takes over so many Charlotte eateries after 11 am...

Hubs and I met some friends for Sunday brunch and I was quite excited to try their fare, as Providence Cafe had just been featured in Charlotte magazine. From the outside, the cafe looks like an upscale eatery, with a stucco like (or just stucco) outside and parking on two sides of the building. It's a bit tucked away from the street, so make sure you look towards the back for extra parking. 

We were seated promptly in the largest booth I've ever sat in. It could have easily sat eight people, therefore the four of us had plenty of space. Service was prompt and friendly - they let the four of us gab and only came over to refill our beverages and check on us just a few times. I was super excited to try their Oscar Omelette - an omelet stuffed with lump crab meat, cream cheese, asparagus and topped with Hollandaise. 

When the food arrived, the portions were nicely sized and the food looked fresh. My omelette was a bit disappointing, while the flavors were nice, there was too much Hollandaise and there was no texture difference in the omelette. Maybe more asparagus would have helped? But. the cream cheese and crab were just a bit too mushy for my liking. 

While the dish I chose wasn't my favorite breakfast item, I'd definitely like to go back and try something else on the menu. Their strawberry and almond french toast looked tasty.)"

Upon my most recent visit, a colleague and I opted for one of the lunch platters, as well as a few additional maki rolls. Of worthy note were the spicy tuna (good amount of heat) and the softshell crab roll. Goodness gracious that was one flavorful roll of sushi.

I'm a happy customer. Each time I've made it into Terrace for breakfast or lunch, I've been pleased both with the ambiance, service, meal and price. Very hot spot for most weekend brunchers\/breakfasters. 

This location can get a bit hairy with parking. Once again, Ballantyne Village has a great parking deck with easy access for all businesses. If the front or lot spaces are all taken, the lot isn't a bad secondary. Also, you'll most likely be waiting for a good bit on the weekends. Take a seat on the sunny benches outside or take a short jaunt around the shopping center. There are plenty of great places to relax while you wait for a table to open up. 

The food is fantastic. Fresh and prepared with care, love, flavor and a hefty amount of tasteful plating. 

Breakfast is great. Eggs are fluffy and fresh (scrambled of course), the waffles are magnificent. I'd recommend the red velvet variety. Coffee is piping hot and refills are free. Doesn't get much better for a morning meal. 

Lunch is also much to be looked forward to. I've had one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches from Terrace. The breading is light and the sauce is balanced between spice, sweet and sour. Bread and veggies are not overwhelming and swallow the whole sandwich. Also, their glasses are such a funky and fun shape. Curved and taper up to the rim. Every kid I've seen in terrace loves them!

Grab some of their wonderful chocolate covered mints on the way out. They may frown upon you grabbing a handful, but its hard to resist.

My wife normally go out for brunch or lunch on Saturday or Sunday so we chose Stewart Penick's Terrace Cafe for lunch today. I had heard a lot of good things about it and my wife had looked over the menu and it had her seal of approval.

Drove down from Cornelius and got there just before noon. Seated immediately and our server was there shortly and presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders.

Back in couple of minutes with our tea's. My wife ordered the Crab Cake Appetizer along with a side of fruit.  I ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken which also had Cheesy Potatoes and Sauted Mixed Vegetables.

Took a good while for these items to come out particularly in light of the fact that my wife asked for her appetizer to be served at the same time as my entree.

Lunch showed up and it was excellent.  My wife as requested that the hold the Garlic Aioli  which they did but at the same time did not bring the Campaign Vinaigrette.On request, it was promptly presented.

My wife enjoyed her Crab Cakes very much and the fruit side was very good and for a change, more than just melon.

The Nashville Fried Chicken was excellent. Nice and spicy with the proper amount of heat.  The Cheesy Potatoes did not have much taste of Cheese however although the Mixed Vegetables were nice and tender.

First time here. Nice Atmosphere, good service and very good food.

We will be back although probably not for Sunday Brunch till after Football Season. My wife insist on being home by 1:00 pm on Sundays and I've learned not to drive to far on game day.),(Didn't want hotel food so Yelp lead me here. 

Everyone says get the chicken and waffles. So I did but added red velvet with fruit. 

Boy it didn't disappoint. Waffle was cooked perfectly crispy on the out and moist in the middle. The fried chicken was seasoned just right and that the syrup made even more savory and sweet and yummy.

The menu can certainly be confusing with one section near the breads that also has all the pastries. The other section has all the ""meal"" options with clearly labeled prices, but if you're not familiar with it, it is very easy to be overwhelmed. The staff are helpful with suggestions if you're not sure what you want and patient if you need to make a decision. Once ordered, the food is prepared and ready for pick up within minutes, even during the lunch rush.

On the negative side, it is a little on the spendy side for such casual eating. A cup of coffee, a bagel (""premium"" bagels are another 25 cents) and a small tub of cream cheese is $4.09. The ""special"" pick two with a drink will run you close to $10, which is two of either a sandwich salad or soup.

The joint was busy already by the time we walked in and continued to be busy as the night progressed. The joint itself has enough tables for groups and tables along with a bar hosting a suite of drinks. 

We were seated in the middle of the dining room with our group of 10 people eagerly awaiting our menus\/meals. The server was very helpful and very quick to provide anything the group needed. I was certainly excited to see the ""Korean spin"" given my roots on southern bbq. After perusing the menu, the group decided to order the beef ribs, pulled pork, the pork belly, and the fire chicken for meats. We then proceeded to order the wings along with the ramen mac and cheese, the kimchi  fries, and tacos. We accompanied all this food with of course some soju . The food came out fairly quickly on large platters and we were all able to get a flavor of all the different food. Starting with the sides, the kimchi fries were delicious and simple and offered a good way to start the meal and great for any fry lovers. The ramen mac and cheese was good although it seemed just more standard mac and cheese then the fusion flavoring I was searching for but still a solid dish. The tacos were delicious and they all disappeared fairly quickly from the table. The meats were all very tender and well cooked. The beef rib came out on a huge bone and was tender off the bone. The pulled pork was again delish with the meat being tender and the marinade being just right on them. The pork belly was crispy on the outside with the frying process and were good. I think they were probably my least memorable but definitely worth a buy especially with groups. The fire chicken was BOMB. The chicken is honestly so juicy and tender and just packed with flavor. My buddy and I were busy inhaling all bites of this and instantly regretted when we ran out of it. The chicken wings were also good. They were standard wings to me that I could get anywhere else so no fusion aspect which was slightly disappointing but overall all the food was very good.

I am glad that I was able to check this place out prior to leaving Charlotte. It certainly has great service, great food, and a fun atmosphere. This is definitely worth a  stop for any people in Charlotte and for any BBQ lovers.)"

The tzatziki sauce is much thicker and has more flavor. The gyro meat is still on the thin side but it's got some taste to it. The chicken was very tasty. The cous cous was excellent as was the tabouli.

Going forward, I'd recommend the chicken over the gyro and either the hummus or the tabouli as your choice for side item.)"

Problem solved. Had to drop my wife off at Charlotte Douglas Airport at 7am so she could catch here flight to Pittsburgh to see her grandkids in Pgh.

Not far from the airport so I dropped here off and headed to @Dawn.

Not as frenetic as The Yolk but it was explained to me that Saturday at The Yolk was more frenetic than the rest of the week and this was more common. Not very crowded but it was also explained to me that they are normally closed on Tuesday but because of being closed extra days during the Holidays, they had decided to open and even things out.

In anycase, was not crowed and when I walked in at 7:20am, I was told I could sit anywhere I liked.

Nice clean and new with a very clean and modern look and feel. Wall decorations are very eclectic and give a warm touch to the place.

My server could not have been nicer. I ordered coffee and I had a cup of fresh coffee on a serving tray almost immediately.  It was worth the trip here if only for the coffee. Very good. Rich and bold with great notes.

For Breakfast i ordered a ESC which stands for soft eggs, sausage and cheese served on Brioche with Red Pepper jelly.  Interesting medley of flavors with a lot of contrast that at the same time, compliment each other to create anunusual and tasteful combination.

Aldi is different than the usual American supermarket style. There are only a few aisles in the store and Aldi typically doesn't carry more than one or two brands of any particular product and you probably won't recognize the names on the labels (GT Cola? Contessa canned veggies?). If you have a specific shopping list, you're going to be leaving without a good number of items, but the ones they do have are very well priced. I'd have to guess at least 20% less than Wal-Mart.

When you're headed to Aldi, it has to be pretty well planned. Bring your own bags because they don't have any. You can usually find a couple of cardboard boxes in the shelves if you forget bags. Even the shopping carts aren't ""free"" - because they want a 25 cent deposit and it's returned when you return the cart. As far as paying for your goodies, they do not accept credit cards or checks - cash or debit only because credit cards cost money!

Would I shop again at Aldi? Maybe. Sometimes it's worth spending more when you shop at Harris Teeter (or even Wal-Mart) because you get a lot more convenience and choice.),(This is a German owned grocery store. If you're looking for cheap groceries, Aldi is your place. The same people who own Aldi also own Trader Joe's. What I found funny here is that you have to insert a quarter into the grocery cart in order to use it. When you're done, you pop the quarter out! It's basically a deposit to use the grocery cart.

They specialize in their own brands so they're able to keep the prices low. We found almost everything we needed on our grocery list with a few minor exceptions. If there's an Aldi around, I'd probably shop there...unfortunately, I'll settle for Trader Joe's for now.)"

Business model for Toast in Davidson changed about a year or so ago and rather than an Organic Expansion, they opted to use the franchise model to expand and since then, a number of these have opened in the area. This is one of the newer ones along with Concord Mills and Indian Land SC.

Davidson was nice when it opened and then it because a victim of it's success with long lines, awful wait times and poor service all in cramped conditions.

This is not a review of that store but rather as they have expanded, the newer stores have more room and can accommodate more people. They still have the tiny tables that they did in the original store and with the additional space, should be able to hire more waitstaff and improve service. Unfortunately not the case.

My wife and I went to the location in University Place this past Monday which was July 4th. Walked in and were promptly seated at a small table in the middle of the room but we did not see a server for over 5 minutes. I was ready to leave when one finally showed up.

I will admit from that point on, service did get better. Presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders and after we did place the orders, they did have our meal out within a reasonable length of time.

My wife order a Quiche with a side of fruit. One of her complaints about sides of fruit is that most of them have a few berries on top but the balance is mostly melon and that was the case here. She did indicate that her quiche was very good.

As for myself, on the menu that had three specials each named for a Presidential contender. The Hillary was a salad with West Coast theme, don;t remember what was the Bernie and the Trumplet was an omelet stuffed with meatloaf. Since I like meatloaf, I order the Trumplet.

Please note that because I ordered the Trumplet, in no was is this to be construed to mean I am a Trump supporter. If that was the case, I would have been very disappointed because the meatloaf inside the omelet was extremely dry and overcooked with little flavor.  What flavor there was came from the Pico de Gallo served on the side.

All in all, this is one of the better and I hope as the restaurant is there for awhile, it get even better.  Cuisine is creative but preparation is average.

I first discovered Brooks Sandwich House a few years ago here on Yelp. It's nothing fancy, just a little stand alone building over by Heist in NoDa. This little hidden gem has been cranking out deliciousness for more than 40 years. 

I love the chili. So, my orders always consist of things smothered in that homemade goodness. A cheeseburger or hot dog all the way... either makes any day better. Order both and it makes the day A LOT better. Might as well get some chili cheese fries while you're at it. They also have options like bologna, livermush, and bbq (when available) on the menu. One day, I will be brave and try livermush. My friend Eddie swears by it. 

Note: Brooks is open Monday-Friday (no weekends) for breakfast and lunch. It is cash only, so plan accordingly. The place is small, so there is no indoor seating. Place your order, wait for your number to be called, then go pay. There are some outdoor seats if the weather is nice.),(Brooks Sandwich House. You can throw all of the expected dopey descriptors in their direction, should you feel so equipped to do so -- ""A true, American classic!"" ""The BEST burger in all of Charlotte!"" ""A real staple, by golly!"" ......whatever. Pick your favorite. 

My take? It's the shining star in a sea of dying breeds for truckers, blue collar, and white collar alike. It's the kind of place, on the local level, that you want to have memories of. You need to experience a burger wrapped in paper and eaten at the dirty, standing room-only, picnic tables. You need to experience the ""line"" during the lunch rush. It's a timeless favorite. 

Would you know about Brooks from reading some hip, haute cuisine magazine? Absolutely not. You're either going to stumble across the reviews and hear about how it's a stellar burger stop with great fries or your friend's grandma's church member's daughter used to go when she was a kid and you have to try it. 

It's a dive and it's utterly perfect. My only regret is that I didn't get my burger all-the-way -- chili, onions, and mustard. That sounds like heaven. 

Do yourself and everyone else a favor and go have your own experience at Brooks.),(Please consider this an apology to all the vegetarians and vegans around the world...sorry...but...

I love bacon. Crispy bacon with the perfect amount of salt and crunch...but not too crunchy of course. Oh, and a touch of grease please. Now, I don't eat bacon too often but for some reason I had an insane hankering for a BLT the other day when I was driving around NoDa. And then the light bulb flickered in my little head...Brooks...Sandwich...House. 

This unassuming little house is simple - a counter, a few friendly employees and cash only. I ordered my BLT, paid the $3 and change and went on my merry way. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the sandwich was the exact no frills option I was seeking. And hey, those breakfast sandwiches look pretty delightful, too. 

Now I'll need to make my way back here (very soon) to dive into a burger...I hear they're fantastic...thanks, Brooks!),(Brooks is that hole in the wall, off the beaten path Mecca.  There is no accidently finding it, you have to be going there.  It is a tiny  walk up counter, pretty smoky from the exhaust.  Simple breakfast items, burgers and dogs. Everything is wrapped in that heavenly white paper.  No tables and chairs, only one long table outside. A very fun visit to fulfill the chowhound in you. Brooks is one of those special places that you need to go at least once.

You fancy huh. Example: I like to wear sweatpants to grab pho or a banh mi. This would not be the spot to do that. 

So, the highlight for me last night has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant and that's not CO's fault at all. Luke Kuechly walked in and stole the focus of every female. And basically all the males as well. The guy sitting next to us jumped up and left his date to go shake his hand. Keep pounding. 

This place is really pretty. It's perfect for a date night spot or to kick off an evening with the girls. I saw a group of ladies laughing over drinks while doing a Christmas exchange type deal at their table... and of course whispering to each other about Luke Kuechly.

I'm not one who typically orders bourbon cocktails when I'm out, but the Dark N Peach was good as well. There's a sriracha bloody mary type drink on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try it.

For food, we went with the beef and kimchi dumplings, drunken Thai noodles, spicy tuna pressed sushi, and fresh summer rolls. The pressed sushi was like little building blocks of deliciousness. My favorite was the dumplings. My dinner pal isn't the biggest fan of kimchi, but even he thought they were fantastic. I had debated between a ramen bowl and the noodles. The couple next to use both got big bowls of brothy goodness. I was immediately jealous. I'll be back for you next time.

I dig the vibe and some of the 'za at Revolution. This is one of those places that I always pass by while in NoDa and, for some reason, rarely stop in. Allow me to break it down for ya...

The Good: The patio is lovely, the place is giant. As Tonya mentioned, this is surely a wonderful spot to grab a few pints, a pizza and hang out for a while. The staff here are super laid back and very friendly - and I hear they have trivia, too! Weekday specials are pretty solid as well - it definitely helps curb the price of the specialty pies. A particular pie I really enjoyed is the NoDa - Grateful Growers pulled pork in all its glory, carmelized onions, peppers and deliciousness. Nommmm!

The Meh: The Carolina Cyclops pie really disappointed me - it was like munching on a salt block. The first bite was the best - the cracked egg tempered the salty pancetta, ham and cheese. But I couldn't have any more after that bite. Sad, salt laden pizza. 

Nevertheless, I'll definitely head back to Revolution for another go - their beer selections is stellar and I'd love to find a few go-to pies to love and adore!),(September days, sitting on Revolution's patio drinking wheat beer overlooking North Davidson- worth the visit alone.

Rundown of what you need to know:

-This is an event that IMO the VIP is not worth it. You don't really get all that much more. Some access to a VIP tent that has some cheese and samples of a few other wines. $25-26 for general admission is a great deal to enjoy a day of sips.

-Bring chairs, blankets, etc and enjoy the day. This is a day long festival and Symphony Park is a great place to spend an afternoon. There's live music, food options for purchase and some different craft type tents to explore.

-Parking is free. However, it's hard to find a spot if you don't get there early. The restaurants block off their parking areas and the mall is just busy in general. This is a drinking event. Take a cab or Uber.

-I know it says you can bring kids, make it a family day and what not. However, people get super drunk. Wine drunk. Holy people watching drunk.

-The crowds are not very good at the whole concept of making a line to get a sample after hours of consuming wine. You're going to get a little annoyed. Good thing you brought that blanket, right?

-Seriously, drunk should be in 72 pt font here.

I had a good time meeting all the different vineyards and vendors. I don't know a lot about wine. I buy based on what the label looks like. So, it was good to learn a little bit along the way.

Just like Beer, Bourbon and BBQ (the same people put this on), I think this is a festival that gets a little bit better each year.),(Great Grapes, in Symphony Park, is a great event that happens every year. Tons of folks come from all over to sample NC wines, enjoy some great local music, and enjoy a day in the park. Had the pleasure of spending the day at this event this past weekend. Here's my take:

Pros:
The wine selection is fun. I'm not the biggest wine connoisseur in the world, but it is fun to go around to the different wineries representing and sample some of their products. 
Food is definitely worth getting if you intend to spend a gratuitous amount of time at the park. This year, Southern Cake Queen and Roaming Fork were there. Also, they had the epitomized ""fried food stands"" that seem to make it out to every festival in town. 
Symphony Park is such a fun spot. Glad they have it here. It had a lot more character, and shade, than some of the other grounds around Charlotte. 

Cons:
Security. These guys seem to only be ""warm bodies"" at times. So many people were walking around hammered and some were even tampering with vendors' stations. Not exactly a good mix. 
Hours of the festival are a bit long. I think a 5-hour festival is the max it should run. 8 hours allows people to get a little sloppy. 

All in all, I'm glad this festival is in Charlotte. Hope it gets better next year!)"

All dips were spot on, the sticks were seasoned heavily, but balanced, and they certainly didn't last long. 6 comes in an order and is a perfect serving for two. 

Our server was very gracious with our vegan order, too. We ordered the veggie pizza with no cheese and also a buffalo chicken....with no chicken or the typical cheeses. Nothing of note for the meat-eater\/dairy-lover, but was rather fulfilling for us. It's rather pleasant to visit a restaurant that doesn't balk at a diet-specific order and is rather generous with the time and consideration. Very humbling.

My family dines there whenever they visit Chicago. 

The food quality, service, and atmosphere are superior to any Olive Garden or ""chain"" Italian places!

Normally this place is a little dressy but the one here ranges from casual to a suit & tie. Either way it's not a snooty place at all and still very elegant.
The restaurant was rich & the environment was very cool and they were playing Sinatra! The ambience was a hit!

The food portions are extremely generous! The food is delicious! The price is very affordable. Although there are more affordable options we selected a special that cost $30 per person but you get to pick 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts....here's the kicker: You get unlimited refils on everything!!! Yes they'll bring out more salad, more appetizers, and more everything. If you go there with your family you will leave fat & happy + they'll box it up to go.

Everything is made from scratch! The dessert was SO great! It was fresh! I had NY style cheesecake and not only was it enough for two men to eat but also it was incredibly enjoyable, and tasted like it never spent a day in a freezer :-)

Same thing goes for the Tiramisu my wife ordered! OMG it was authentic tasting, huge, and downright yummy!

The service here is outstanding! Our waiter was very professional and efficient. He was pleseant and never rushed us at all.

Very helpful and always willing to help you find what you're looking for...or what you didn't know you were looking for before your visit. 

Multiple times, I've come in and intended on buying a growler or six-pack of a particular brew\/brewery and ended up with something else. Love it when that happens. 

Love that they carry growlers from ""hard to reach"" breweries like Greenman, Mystery, and Fullsteam. Though there's nothing like getting it straight from the source, Salud makes it a nice treat when you can't make it to the Triangle, Asheville, or Hillsborough. One other gem that I was stoked to find was Slingshot Coffee. Iced coffee concentrate or ready-to-drink coffee brewed and bottled in Raleigh. I had heard about it in an article and found that Salud is one of the only places that carries it in Charlotte. Looks like I'll be in frequently to pick up this treat. 

Love that you can pay with Square, too. Texting myself a receipt is so much better than printing something I'm going to throw away. 

Though parking can sometimes be a pain, you can slip in and out really quick if you're picking up beer and going. If you're staying to enjoy beer on draught or take a seat and split a six-pack with some buds, you may want to find a parking space down the road a bit. The parking lot behind the shop seems a little sketchy with all of the $5 signs. I'm never sure what to trust, haha. Proceed with caution. 

Cheers!),(Tops of the Hops! 
These guys are doing some incredible with beer. They have an amazing variety of different beers available in the 6-pack, 4 pack, or by the bomber. They will even can a beer or fill a growler! They seem to go for the hard-to-find local beers, as well as a lot of seasonal beers. 
The selection is pretty amazing. They know their beer, and have hundreds of selections of beers to go for. They have a small bar in here that will serve up a pint, with great daily specials. The service is very friendly. 
You can take your food from Fud next door into the bar and check out all the brands they offer. 
The shop was clean, and it seemed like the beer inventory rotates around quickly enough that they're not trying to sell previous years' seasonal beers, or had bottles covered in dust. The shop was spotless, and had a few areas to sit and enjoy a beer.  
I was happy to see that they offer some free brewing literature near the entrance. 
Parking was easy!)"

Every item is named after something movie related. Movie lines, characters, etc. I love it.

The location is a little confusing. It is on the back side of the building on 715 Providence. So if you park out front (where you'll see Toccare and Stagioni), walk around to the back of the building. You'll see the big patio and also a parking lot there. 

So, let's start with that big 'ole patio. I cannot wait until it warms up outside. It looks like a great place to hang out and to have drinks.

This is not one of those restaurants where you sit down and a server automatically brings you chips and salsa. If you want them, you have to order and pay for them. Instead of salsa, I order the Billy Ray Valentine. It's like cheese dip on steroids.... a queso with chorizo, corn relish and pico. I usually get two tacos and a side of the creamy white beans. Tacos range from $3.50-$4 and you can add a side for $2. So if you go the taco route, you'll spend about $10 for your meal. So far I've had: ""I'll Have What She's Having"" (grilled mahi-mahi), ""Uncle Buck"" (fried oysters) and ""Fat Guy In A Little Coat"" (grilled skirt steak). I've liked them all so far. 

I haven't had anything from the cocktail list yet. I'm excited to try their version of a spicy margarita. Last night, they had $5 white sangria on special. I'm not the biggest sangria person, but hey when in Rome right? Or should I say Mexico?

The staff have all been nice. Service has been a little hit or miss. I think they're still feeling things out since they are fairly new.)"

It's very close to home, they never screw up the order and the Pho is flipping fantastic. I get the Pho Ga which is simply chicken soup and my wife has been enjoying the Pho Chay (a vegetarian soup).

The takeout is well organized with separate containers for the broth and for the noodles. And another separate container for the bean sprouts, limes, hot peppers and fresh basil leaves.

I don't know about the other foods they offer. The last time I had the Chinese, it was just meh. But the pho? It's PHO-bulous.),(A-OK is a good description for this place. You can definitely get a solid meal here, but I think there are better options out there.

After a long day of football, and celebrating a Panthers win, I stopped by here for a warm bowl of comfort. I went with my go-to Vietnamese order: fried spring rolls and pho with meatballs. The spring rolls were just meh. The pho was good. I've had better here in Charlotte. This wouldn't be my first choice, but I will come here again.

The service was quick. The workers friendly. There is a super cool fish tank behind the register. I was like a little kid staring at it. Made me think about the scene in Finding Nemo when the little girl's is tapping on the tank and yelling fishy! Gah, I love that movie.

Back to Saigon. I have not yet experienced the Sunday buffet. I need to come hit that up after football season. Asian buffets + Nikki = besties.

Kudos to Saigon Palace on the new website. It looks so much better!),(Great place for a quick and healthy lunch.  Saigon isn't my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town but it is definilty a tasty bite.  I decided on the vermicelli and beef lunch special - a huge portion for under $10.
I saw some chinese menu options as well so if your not big on the Vietnamese food know that you can still choose from a wide selection of menu items.  The staff is very friendly and I love the giant fish tank behind the register.  I heard around town that there seafood hot pot for 2 rocks.  I'll be back to try some more items for sure.),(Unfortunately, I must retract my previous statement.

The best pho is no longer here, the noodles are not quite right (too mushy and grainy), and the broth is not that flavorful. They do accept AMEX though. Note: the Pho Ga is not bad because the chicken is tender.

See Viet-Thai grille for the best pho and pad thai ever!)"

I travel to Charlotte often for business, and am always craving fresh fruit... like a fruit cup or anything.. which seems to be very hard to find for some reason.  One day as I was walking to work, I noticed Rico's Acai truck situated in a parking lot.  I told myself I'd try this for breakfast the next day.

Breakfast the next day turned into breakfast everyday.  Rico's is my go-to for breakfast and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  Obviously I wouldn't eat this every single day if I didn't have a breakfast allowance since it is absolutely on the pricey side.  The delicious small Rainbow Bowl sets you back almost $11.  $11 for breakfast everyday is a little bit over the top.  However, I have seen people get this for dinner or a snack after their evening workouts.  

Either way, this stuff is the bomb!  I always get the rainbow bowl.  They've not had mangoes since I've been here - you either get a choice of mango or pineapple.  The granola is crunchy and adds a nice texture to the rest of the bowl.  The acai tastes fresh and isn't too sweet.  The loads of fruit - all kinds! - in the Rainbow Bowl make me happy.  

The only downside is I haven't seen them wash their fruits.  It looks like it comes straight out of the fridge in the same plastic container it came in originally..... which makes me a little ehhhh since I always wash my fruits.  Aside from that, I love this place.

Call ahead if you can, because at certain times it gets really busy and you end up having to wait.  Staff here are super nice.

Make sure you save room for dessert. Five words that will change your life: Mile High Peanut Butter Pie. I have no will power so I usually add this at the last minute when I pick up my to go order. I find it's easier to justify getting it by telling myself ""well you did order a fresh, healthy salad.""

Another must have is the strawberry lemonade. It's amazing. I avoid ordering it when I sit down to eat there, in fear I'll drink 12 and develop diabetes.

We've also used Savor for catering here at ye old TV station. Always a great meal and satisfying experience all the way around. 

Great local business doing great things. Keep it up!),(YUMMY YUMMY IN MY TUMMY....another great lunch spot and this place is not a secret anymore it was packed.  I had the special a grouper sandwich on foccacia with veggie casserole it was fresh and delicious I didn't leave anything left on my plate.

The menu is a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, and it looked like a few entrees I remember seeing meatloaf but not sure what else was on there... they had a few vegetarian items to choose from as well and once again I was way to full for dessert but they looked fantastic.  I can't wait to come back for dinner.),(Still drool worthy, always solid and super friendly service...this is Savor Cafe. 

In my past review I discussed the deliciousness in the mile high peanut butter pie, farmer's sandwich, strawberry lemonade and mac 'n cheese. Rest assured, these menu items are just as delightful today! But, it's worth noting the following...

1) The addition (bar area) is excellent. More tables, both high tops and standard height and a really great looking bar. 

2) That being said, there's a cocktail menu, now! And oh my is it tasty. The drinks are seasonal but super fresh and delightful. I had a berry mojito that was strong but really flavorful! 

3) For a while, I only hit up Savor Cafe for lunch. I branched out and tried the salads - the Cobb is by far my favorite. Ridiculously fresh and packed with everything a Cobb should be!

4) And then I started dropping by for an occasional dinner. Um, shrimp and grits, FTW! Creamy, dreamy cheese grits topped with magnanimous shrimp. And do yourself a favor and check out the dinner (and dessert specials). I've had a fantastic scallop dish with black rice followed by a mixed berry cobbler that was out of this world. 

5) Lastly, if you ever see the coconut cake listed as a special dessert, get it. Get the whole cake. It rivals the best coconut cake I've ever had (in Charleston). Amazing. I salivate just thinking about it. 

Hungry? Go to Savor Cafe.),(How many times have I driven by Savor, thinking in my head, I have to try this place.  Finally, I decide to drop by this week.  Savor could be one of my favorite restaurants, it covers all the bases.

Maybe it's my fault. I primarily do take out orders at this store. Look, I get that it's always busy here. But, why is it always a cluster-expletive at the hostess stand and waiting area? There are enough people behind that counter to land a space shuttle. How is my five minute interaction with the workers here always awful?

My latest unfortunate service experience: I placed my take out order Sunday for soup and egg rolls. And by Sunday, I mean it was 3:30pm. It wasn't during church rush-hour. The girl who took my order warned me that at the moment it was taking 25 minutes for to-go orders. Okay, that's fine. She also talked to me like she would rather play in traffic than be behind that counter. Here's the real problem: my order came out ten minutes later. No one even bothered to look at the bag. I never gave it a second thought because I was told it would be at least 25 minutes. I figured it was a call-in order and that's why no one did anything. So, 30 minutes after placing my order I finally walked up to ask about my food. I was handed the bag, which was the only bag there on the counter. I said, ""oh, it's the bag that's been sitting there for 20 minutes and no one called my name."" The girl just kind of rolled her eyes and gave me attitude. Sigh.

Things to know: like I said, this place is always busy. Go ahead and expect a wait. Your best bet is to make a reservation. Although, the family next to me made their reservation a week ahead of time and still had to wait for their table to be ready. Also, check the bar area. You may be able to snag a spot there. 

My favorite thing here is the egg drop soup. I usually just order a large size of that and the lettuce wraps for my meal. I'm also a fan of the Sichuan-style asparagus.

I don't know what the secret is to having a solid experience here. The Phillips Place location seems to function more smoothly than this one. My advice is to just be patient.),(I truly love everything about PF Chang's I don't get the chance to go often and when I do I am usually very happy with my food.  I love my warrior card that gives me great discounts every time I stop in.  I think PF Chang's has done a great job marketing themselves in this economy offering good food at great prices.  That being said I stopped in for lunch last week and was so disappointed with the food and lunch specials in general.  I ordered a tofu dish with veggies and brown rice the specials come with a choice of soup or salad which is great and the prices range from $7 to $16 or so a dish.  Anyways I had to dig through my veggies just to find 1 of the maybe 5 pieces of tofu that were actually in my dish.  My coworker ordered the sesame chicken and he had a lot more shrimp then chicken in his dish oops.  Good thing he wasn't allergic to shellfish.  Overall the service was good but I will not be coming back for lunch.),(When we first entered, we were seated immediately, but then had to wait ten minutes for water, let alone other drinks. When I ordered a soda, the waiter forgot it. The brown rice was spongy and had to be returned (wasn't just me; my wife agreed). The fruit they gave as a side order for my son's meal was supposed to be blueberries and raspberries, but they more resembled mush. The chef and\/or waiter were obviously making no effort to impress. The ribs were great, the Lo Mein was good, and the Sesame Chicken and Wonton Soup were tiny servings and good (not great). We were also served the ribs without any plates, so we had to wait five minutes to eat them, which led to lukewarm ribs. After all this I anticipated some kind of credit, but to no avail. I don't care about the money. I just told myself that if they make an effort, I will return. If not, I won't. They didn't make an effort. I will not return, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone. The decor is excellent. Otherwise, you're overpaying for decent-to-good food (not great) and subpar service.),(Well, visiting from the hollars of WNC, it was time to visit another place I liked, but just didn't have a good time when I did it with the basket dropper.....the farther down the line the better things get..........

Happy hours still are the best value.),(I went to PF Chang's several years ago in Minnesota and was not impressed but I am always open to giving it another try.  

The environment was very pleasant with great space and lively activity in the many rooms and outdoor area.  The service was courteous and friendly but the food lacked any level of impressiveness.

Meeting a Yelp friend (you know who you are) for a birthday party, I was impressed with the substantial beer selections and the unique pairings of proper beer food to go with it. I've posted a pic of the beer menu that is posted on the wall and they don't just sell pints - they offer smaller ""taster"" sizes if you really want to explore the offerings.

As for the food impression, I liked it. Brats, pretzels, pretzel bites and more. One of the folks at the table had the full size pretzel and it was a massive thing with a decent sized pot of dipping cheese. It looked good. On the other hand, my brat with onions and peppers and sauerkraut was awesome. I had a side of the potato salad and was not disappointed. Served warm, with a vinegar tang and bits of bacon in there, it was excellent. Next time, I might just have the potato salad and be done.

And then, my complaint. I am not a fan of bars that feel they need to set up entertainment. Whether it's bingo or trivia, when the speaker blasts so loud that you can't have a normal conversation even when screaming, I get up and go. And that's why I left VBGB after just the one beer even though I was having a good time up to then with new friends. Sorry, with this I had to drop a star.

Parking is tight, especially when there is something going on at the Amphitheater next door.),(My favorite part about this place: it's the only spot at the NC Music Factory that I can count on being open every day. 

If you come here and can't find something you enjoy, well the problem is you my friend. VBGB has a more than impressive beer selection (including a ton of local brews), great bar food, killer patio, and #allthegames. It's the perfect spot to grab drinks and eats before or after a show at the Amphitheatre\/Fillmore\/FountainPlaza\/Comedy Zone. 

Don't like beer? They have a full bar. Don't enjoy bar food? Get a salad. First time ordering food here? You have to go to the kitchen window. Don't go to the bar. Every time I'm here i see someone make that mistake. They now serve lunch on Fridays. I tend to order too much food here. I'm not sure why I feel like I need a pretzel, dog or brat of some sort, and wings.  The beer cheese is delicious.

The patio is massive and loaded picnic tables. You can even reserve a table. It's tented during the cool months. There's a window to order drinks so you don't have to go inside. A ton of things to do- sand volleyball courts, cornhole, oversized games. I always want to play giant chess, but I have no idea how to play chess. 

Parking is free. Heads up, you may have to park pretty deep in the lot on concert nights. Also, expect an Uber surge if you try to leave when one of these events end. Plan accordingly.),(VBGB is one of my favorite places in the NC Music Factory. Both the indoor and outdoor seating are much to be envied by other bars. 

The bar has tons of local beers on draught. NoDa, Birdsong, OMB, Natty Greene's, and plenty of others. If the weather is poor, from rain or sweltering heat, take a seat at the bar and rest your frosty glass on the ice rail. Yes, it's like a gift from the beer-filled heavens. What an incredible and innovative idea. It keeps your beer icy and gives the kids something to play with!

The food is grade A bar food. Grilled pretzels with beer cheese, brats, dogs, and wings. The best things we've had have been the hippie nachos. Complete with crumbled blackbean burgers and nacho cheese. The fried banana peppers are to die for and are great on everything you can get your beer-drinking hands on. The pretzels.....oh, sweet lord. Amazing. I've been hard pressed not to drink the cheese at times. Salty and perfect consistency. 

I love that this place is kid friendly. Sure, there's tons of booze flying by and it can draw a bit of a rougher crowd, but take the kids in for a hotdog on the patio at lunchtime and it's better than a ballpit. Tons of games for the kids to play out back and the staff is so friendly. The bartenders were giving the kids straws and other things to play with on the ice rail at the bar. How nice is that? Definitely a plus for those who have little ones and had to forgo a sitter. 

VBGB is a perfect afternoon spot for a beer and brat. Great to watch the game or have a patio lunch with the fam. High-fives all around!),(I visited VBGB Beer Hall and Garden last Saturday night for a birthday party.  It's a great venue for large group gatherings.  The restaurant\/bar is presumably modeled after German beer halls and gardens.

Inside, there is a huge horseshoe-shaped bar with plenty of seating.  On the floor, there are several large picnic-style, communal tables (like a German beer garden would have).  Above, there are a handful of TV displays tuned to sports.

Outside, there is big patio with more tables and many games.  Games include giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, giant chess, cornhole, and more.  Since it was cold outside, the patio was enclosed and heat lamps were brought out to provide a measure of warmth.

Ample free parking is available in a paved parking lot directly outside the building.  I'm not sure when this place opened, but it feels relatively new.  A reservation was made for our party of 20+, so two tables were blocked off with signs for our group.

You can get beer at the bar and there's a window by the kitchen where you can order food.  After placing your food order, you're given a number to place at your table and your food is brought out to you.  VBGB's food menu mainly consists of bar food such as fries, onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, and burgers.  I was told by the staff that their most popular items are their jumbo pretzels, bratwurst, and kabobs.  I like their affordable pricing -- not a single item over $10.

I tried the following:
Chicken bratwurst with spinach and feta ($6)
Quinoa salad ($3) - black beans, corn, tomato, cilantro, lime vinaigrette, colored tortillas
Fried pickles ($3)
Cinn-A-Yum pretzel ($5) - jumbo pretzel covered in cinnamon & sugar, w\/ vanilla icing on the side

Complimentary sauerkraut and sauteed peppers and onions are available for any bratwurst or hot dog order upon request.  I had sauerkraut put on my chicken brat.  I also had it served in VBGB's housemade pretzel bun, so I ended up with a very unique brat.  It wasn't a pork brat and it wasn't served in a typical bun.

It didn't take very long for the food to arrive from the kitchen.  The brat was freshly grilled and the bun was freshly toasted.  The brat was large, but I wouldn't consider it jumbo.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  I could taste the spinach and feta, but the flavors were subtle.  The sauerkraut wasn't bad.  As for the bun, it definitely tasted like and almost had the consistency of a pretzel.

The quinoa salad was good.  It was served with a side of hard, colored tortillas.  I could have done without the tortillas and more quinoa.  The quinoa salad was healthy and refreshing.  It was served in a small paper tray.

The fried pickles were served piping hot.  They came with a side of dipping sauce, which I didn't try.  The fried pickles were good enough on their own.  I recommend sharing this side as it's a bit greasy.

The Cinn-A-Yum pretzel is the dessert spin on VBGB's jumbo pretzel.  The pretzel is indeed jumbo and they coat it in a thick layer of cinnamon and sugar.  It's expectedly sweet and you even have the option of having it coated with vanilla, chocolate, caramel, or raspberry icing.  I had the (vanilla) icing served on the side and used it as a dip.  Due to their sheer size, I recommend sharing these pretzels too.

Jessica was our server and she seemed pretty cool.  Very friendly, as were many of the staff.

Overall, I had a good time at VBGB.  It had a nice relaxed and casual atmosphere and proved to be a good meeting place for a big group of friends.

Trivia: VBGB stands for Very Big German Beer.),(A quick stop off for a few beers turned out to a drinking fest and calling it an early night as my friend and I drank too much .....that is a good sign VBGB!!!),(Pretty awesome beer garden with lots of fun games. Great selection of food and local beers!!! The staff is also very knowledgable of their beers and there is a different choice of sizes - whether you really thirsty and want to have a good time - there's a whole pitcher or if you just want to relax there's also 12 oz 15 oz etc. 

I ordered the daily special with the pretzel bun. Highly suggest getting anything with their pretzel bun and potato chips. Secondly, hope you practice your chess and corn hole because they have a life size chess board and two sets of corn hole spots. I am not good at either especially with some beer in me so I deff need practice the next time I go. 

This place has a nice outdoor deck and is great for large groups! See you soon VBGB!),(So with my time in Charlotte coming to a close, the team has been looking to have team activities which included places where we could have adult beverages outside and play some games. VBGB is just the spot for that given its games (i.e., Ping Pong, volleyball, connect 4, cornhole, etc.), outside patio drinking, good bar food and of course good drinks. This joint has its own parking lot and is fairly large allowing for large groups to come and participate in activities. The bar is stocked with lots of good drinks inclusive of beers, whiskey, etc and the bartenders\/waitresses are all super friendly. There is also a counter inside to go in and order some bar food inclusive of wings, tots, burgers, etc. 

They have 3 or 4 games of cornhole ready to be uses, two ping pong tables, connect 4, life size chess, etc allowing for all members of the group to participate in any activity you want or just simply eat and drink at tables outside while watching all the action. All of the food items are good with plenty of bar options. Obviously a pub style so definitely great to get large groups so you can get a flavor for multiple different things. The Beer selection is also solid with many different options along with all of the other drink items available for people to order. This is a solid place to hit up with large groups or just if you want an option for all these different activities. Definitely recommend for folks in town.),(One of the more fun bars I've been to on a Tuesday night, and here I am in Charlotte, NC.  A friend met me here for my 1 night in town, and she said she wanted to show me something different rather than a generic bar.  Glad she took me here.

First off, they had a ton of beers on tap and for some reason it was $3 beer night.  I chatted with my bartender for a bit to help choose my first beer, but the 2nd and 3rd beers were all her doing.  I have no idea what I drank but all 3 were good, and my tab was $9 before tax and tip.  I've had single beers before that cost $9.

The rest of place is just awesome if you want to be entertained.  Inside a big bar with World Series of Poker playing on the TV (oh hey, I made that show).  Outside there's a full volleyball court with sand.  WTF!?  Super-sized Connect 4 games.  Board games a plenty.  I played Battleship outside at midnight at a bar drinking a beer.  Pretty sure that's as good as it gets for a Tuesday!)"

The waitstaff don't leave much to the imagination. I found it to be too obvious and rather distracting, but that's just me. The place is usually very packed, so others clearly have a different opinion.

It's a well executed concept with decent bar food, I had a ""Sloppy Jane"" which is shaved rib eye, cole slaw and Swiss cheese served with a massive pile of salty spiced fries. While it certainly qualified on the ""sloppy"" scale, I'll try something else next time. I've heard that the burgers are all very good.

Plenty of beer choices and of course a full bar of mixed drinks, the place gets very busy during major sporting events, though on this particular Saturday the college games and the NASCAR race were muted while the singer in the corner did his thing.

Lots of tables as well as interesting ""bar"" areas where you have a hightop stool but you're sort of sharing the space with the guy across from you. If you're looking for a new sports bar hangout, this is absolutely the place to try!),(APPETIZERS:
The garlic butter cheese fries were amazing, just like you might think, and probably terrible for your health.

We had the nacho tortilla chips as an appetizer. It was HUGE, not so much a fan. Also tried the clams, which were surprisingly good considering this place is the Irish version of Hooters.

ENTREES:
$10 for corned beef and cabbage? Not bad at all! The cabbage was a little over buttered for my taste, but I thought the corned beef was well cooked, tender and very tasty. 

Tried the fish and chips, and it was not bad. I would stay away from the chicken in cream sauce... it is way too creamy. Everything is served in gigantic portions, make sure you save half for lunch!

DESSERT:
I got the Bailey's Cheesecake (would've preferred the original or Oreo), but it was still good.)"

Loved the layout of the store, and the staff was incredibly warm and friendly.

My blueberry white chocolate oatmeal was heavenly, so good and even better as it was freshly baked. The ratio of all the ingredients were perfect! I tried my coworkers cheesecake cookie, and it tasted like a real cheesecake!

Unfortunately I forgot about the Ron Swanson and had it the next day, and it wasn't very good. I thought the sweet and salty of the cookie and bacon would be a good combo, but I think I was too hooked on the other cookies! Although it won't be awhile I can't wait to go back and get some more!)"

In the location where Snoops used to be, and not much aesthetically has changed since the inception of PB, a great spot for a quick lunch or sustenance from an afternoon in Independence Park. The interior definitely isn't inviting. There are some seriously creepy decor items that look like they were plucked hastily from the garbage. The booths are re-purposed from who knows where and have some noticeable wear to them. 

I had asked about how they prepare their fish and I received several stares as if I had grown three heads. I asked if it were prepared with butter as opposed to oil. Their response: ""It's grilled."" Well, thanks for that beautiful diatribe of information, but didn't get me very far. I had to repeat the question for an answer. I just laughed. I mean, come on. That's just hilarious. 

My biggest guff is with the service. Shocker. The kid at the counter was one of the strangest people I've had the obligatory need to work with. He was wearing a pair of headphones around his neck, barely seemed to care that I was ordering with my friend, and did some things that were just a little too strange to comprehend. I needed my receipt and upon asking for it, he grabbed it from the trash and un-crumpled it in front of me and handed back....No words, brosef. 

The food, per usual, was passable. Decent flavor, salsas are mediocre, and the price is a little steep. I do really dig their grilled veggies, though. 

Can't say that I'm looking to head back in any time soon to this location, but I'm glad Southend still holds it down. I really hope this location improves. I love where it's located in Elizabeth.)"

...away
...from everyone
...asap

I called one of my oldest friends that recently moved down to the area and we hit the ""savage"" streets of Charlotte.  Now when NY boys are out of state, we gotta represent to the fullest.  The nightlife in Charlotte was interesting to say the least but it had a ton of potential.  

The city's bars and clubs almost emulate Manhattan and it's a 50\/50 type of feeling one gets.  You think it's cool that it's ALMOST like NYC but then you're thinking ""Be Original"".  Anyway, after checking out a few of the bars and clubs, we hit Dixie's Tavern. 

Of course, the thought of two ""brothas"" walking into a spot with that name may make you shudder with fear and anxiety.  The place was very laid back and popping with a really nice sized crowd.  I purposely wore my College of Saint Rose t-shirt to lure out the New Yorkers in the crowd and there were plenty.  Albany, NYC, Long Island...we probably met close to 15 of them.

The music was mixed and that was OK with us.  It bounced between old school hip hop, top 40, country and classic rock.  It's almost like VH1, BET and CMT got blended into an interesting recipe and the dish was plated as Dixie's Tavern. 

 It was the typical NY vibe were we argued with NC people about the Yankees, the Giants, Biggie, Jay-Z, pizza, etc...all good and fun drunken joking with the locals.  It was almost like an old school New Paltz type of night.  We saw a couple of fights, some vomiting, slow bar-tending...typical NY college town stuff.  We also discovered that we were there the LAST NIGHT they were open.  I guess they've closed and I have no idea what's there now.   That really is unfortunate because we did have a serious amount of fun at a pretty low-key place.  I guess we are getting old.  Thanks for the fun Dixie's, you will be missed.)"

Reservations only.  Very small and comparable to ""How to Cook a Wolf"" (size wise) in Seattle.  Quaint, cute and romantic.  

I was told they have the best gnocchi in the country.  I've tried lots of gnocchi in my time, but not enough to say it's the best.  I will say the sauce was dynamite.  Spectacular.  It's remained on their menu for the 13 years they've been around so obviously they have it right.

The bread -- was delicious, but I noticed the tables next to us all got 2 pieces each and we only got one.  I was the only nonwhite person in the restaurant and I hope that's not the reason why.  Then again we were in the south.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope maybe they were just low at the time.  

The foie gras was not the best ever, but the presentation and the flavors were well prepared and tasty.  I had a mahi mahi with mango puree for my main dish and it was right up my alley!  A Caribbean kick with a tangy sweet balance from the mango.  Delicious and fresh.  

My friend loved the dessert which was a extra gewy cinnamon roll in a iron cast dish.  I found it to be dry on the outside but I was told it was very most inside and was good.  

My cappuccino was burnt.  I was disappointed but didn't complain about it.  I figured they do things differently down there and maybe my expectations probably exceeded most coming from the northwest.  I just graciously smiled and fudged a little to the waiter about it being good.

While on the book of face today, I saw a flier for Fitz's three year anniversary party and thought it was time to re-visit this one. 

Why this place wins: it's the closest restaurant\/bar to TWC Arena AND they validate parking for the Wake Forest Garage. So, don't throw your garage ticket on the dashboard and remember to bring it inside with you. And when you bring it inside, don't forget to ask your server or bartender to validate the ticket for you.

Leaving the arena after a big event is always a pain, but especially know because of all the construction outside. I'll usually walk over to Fitz's for a drink after a game or show and wait for the traffic to clear. The patio is fantastic for people watching.

Menu-wise, I think the food has gotten better over the years. I usually order the Drop-Kick Chicken Sandwich. Buffalo sauce and bleu cheese make everything delicious. App wise I go with pretzel bites (beer mustard and queso dipping sauce FTW) and the wings. I mix hot and teriyaki sauces. I haven't had the chipotle mango, but it's next on my list to try.

Service can be hit or miss here. I've had good and not so good experiences here. This is a Penn State and Steelers bar. Steeler Sundays are nuts. Get there early. They also have IC Light for game day.

This is one of those places where you walk up to the counter and order. They bring your food out to your table when it's ready. Overwhelmed by the menu (not that it's massive or anything... just a lot of solid looking items), the guy at the counter walked me through options. Traditional, specialty oven baked, grilled. I went with his suggestion of the garlic & clams oven baked pie. Clams, pancetta, roasted garlic oil, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.

It's a walk-up situation. Walk in, go to the counter with a nicely sized menu above, order, and grab a seat with number in hand. There are a few options when it comes to pizza -- traditional style, grilled pizzas, and oven-baked. We checked out the traditional cheese and the grilled pesto pizza. 

A few notes: the grilled pesto pizza was awesome. Good amount of char on the bottom, killer grilled flavor, tasty veggies, pungent pesto, a dusting of parm, and not-so symmetrical shape. I think we both could have gone for a well-done crust, but it was still awesome. The cheese pizza was good, but also was lacking just a bit in the doneness of the crust. Though, we are both fans of blackened crust(s) on pizza. 

We also checked out the mozz wedges as an app. Where they didn't blow me away, the cheese was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I was curious if they were making it in-house. 

Another huge plus, they have a nicely organized grouping of local brews -- OMB, Birdsong, Triple C, and NoDa. Went with a few pints of Jalapeno pale and CoCo LoCo. 

Pricepoint is rather fair. Can't argue too much with two pizzas, an app, and two beers for $30. 

I'm looking forward to heading back really soon.

Between the crispy fried chicken (which he declared his favorite EVER, a bold statement), the cheerwine sauce, the buttery biscuit and the perfectly cooked egg, it left him speechless for the entire breakfast. 

They are one of the few places that brings your food straight to your table, and service was extremely kind! We will definitely make this a repeat visit :)),(Three Egg Omelet was extremely tasty. Loved the cheese and veggies. There was actually so much that I almost wish it was a four egg omelet!

The toast was freshly baked of course, and delish! I thought the employees were very friendly, and I loved the presentation of the food on the flat board. All around win!)"

Located right in front of our hotel, it's convenient. We were seated right away, and given 2 large baskets of tortilla chips for our party of 5.

I had just landed from SFO, so wanted to unwind with my jack and coke. Others ordered the huge frozen margaritas that were very tasty! Very addicting!

We ordered guacamole, which came in a huge molcajete, those stone looking bowls. Lots of guac but a bit bland for my taste, had to add salt to my portion. 

Flipped through their book of a menu, and everything is fairly cheap! I wanted variety so went for the chicken tamale, ground pork enchilada, and chile releno with refried beans and mexican rice. All this for $10! And the plate was huge!!! The enchilada was bleh, tamale was decent, but was blown away that their chile releno was so tasty. It's really hard to find a good one, but this chile not only had a kick to it, but lots of cheese.

Coworkers also all enjoyed their dishes for the most part. The food is good, but not out of this world. Towards the end of dinner, service was...gone. I waited 10 minutes for another jack and coke, and he totally forgot so had to ask another guy. It basically came as my dessert as we were all done.

Rule number one for a sporting event: eat a meal before you start boozing. It sounds simple, right? Of course, it never is. We ventured here around 4pm before the Monday Night Football game. We ordered chips and salsa, the triple grilled cheese with waffle fries, hot dogs with kraut (plus mashed potatoes and gravy), and a couple of quesadillas. Now, I have no idea if they make the gravy from scratch, but I will say it's peppery and absolutely delicious. I will make sure every order I place here included something covered in gravy. The grilled cheese features brie as one of the three. Let's face it, brie makes everything better. A warning about the quesadilla: the Habenero Ranch is no joke. It's a delayed burn after the first taste. The table next to us got the fish and chips and I immediately wanted to order that, too. Huge portion for the fish. It looked really good.

However, my disappointment led to delight when I saw that they had all kinds of burgers that would make a viking proud. I got one that was topped with a fried egg on top. How Scandinavian is that?! The burger was filling and delicious. It came with fries, which didn't look like they were straight from Oslo, but still pretty good. 
I enjoyed the fact that they have a great location at the front of an old-timey food court and mall. There's plenty of bicycle parking out in front, along with a nice little ""parklett"" that you can take your food to go. 
The interior looks like someone raided an old barn and tacked up the siding all on the walls, giving it a rustic feel. 
They serve a variety of beers, including some local craft beers.

It's a seat yourself establishment. It's quite small inside. If you're in a rush, best to go elsewhere. Even at its most crowded, there are never more than two staffer working the front of house here. It's slow to order, slow to receive your order, even slower to get any refills or seconds, and even slower than that to get your check and pay.

But the food, beer selection, and vibe keep it at 4 stars. The menu doesn't have a ton of selections, but it's large enough. The burgers are great. The buffalo chicken dip is a definite fav of mine. Skip the salads.

There's several TVs and all tuned to different channels, which is nice.

The staff, when you can get their attention, are very nice and friendly.

This weekly celebration goes down every Friday in Historic South End. You can find 
a wide assortment of Charlotte's best local food trucks. It's a great way to support local businesses and have the chance to try a little bit of everything.

Things to know:

1) Parking is a disaster. Be prepared to search for a spot on a nearby street and hoof it.

2) It will be busy. Get there early for a good spot in the grass.

3) Bring lawn chairs and\/or a blanket

4) You can BYOB. Common Market is also right there though if you want to pick something up when you arrive.

You will be able to identify the popular trucks easily. They will have the longest lines. If you are set on a grilled cheese from Papi Queso- you may have to wait an hour.

I love starting the night off here with friends. Very laid back and casual. You can expect to see all kinds of people. It's also family, kid and dog friendly.

You're most likely to find the likes of:

Turkey And...
Papi Queso
Tin Kitchen
Cupcake Delirium
Southern Cake Queen
Herban Legend
Auto Burger
Sticks and Cones

and plenty others join the ranks on the regular. 

Parking is a disaster. Plain and simple. You're better off finding a parking space somewhere off of South, a nearby garage, or even going further down Camden or finding a space at Atherton. If the weather's nice, make a nice of walk of it. 

I'd recommend bringing some easy-to-carry chairs, a blanket, and a cooler of beers\/water. Some of the trucks sell drinks (Papi Queso usually has a nice assortment) but some tend to not carry any. Common Market is an easy choice for a beverage, but get ready to stand in a long line if it's a busy FFF.

On a Saturday night, there was a solid wait for a table - 45 minutes. We spent it wandering the nearby neighborhood and were only accosted by one ""upper class"" beggar who wanted ""a dollar toward a vegetarian burrito, man"". Love NoDa!

We started with the ""Gator Bites"" - a small plate of battered and fried alligator tail. Despite living in South Florida for a decade, I've somehow managed to miss out on this delicacy. Tender and rather buttery, you should give it a try.

For our mains, I chose the day's special - a half-rack of St. Louis Ribs which came with an ear of corn and cole slaw and fries. I cleaned the plate. I love ribs and these were particularly fall-off-the-bone. My date chose the blackened steak, which she said was cooked perfectly and the side greens were excellent.

I would have thought that after a meal like this we would have been stuffed solid, but our lovely waitress managed to convince us to share a bread pudding and cappuccino.

Great meal, great service, great date. We will absolutely be back!),(Wow, how is it possible for a Cajun place to have so little flavor? Everything here was completely bland, uninspired, and barely resembled the amazing food that comes out of New Orleans. I've seriously had better Lean Cuisines than what we ordered. It probably didn't help that we came a few days before Christmas, originally planning to eat at Revolution Pizza across the street, but having to settle on Boudreaux's because Revolution was closed for the holidays. As soon as we walked in you could feel the nasty cigarette smoke in the air (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385694117\/in\/set-72157623503537096\/), I definitely do not miss that about North Carolina restaurants.

After waiting well over 10 minutes, someone finally came by our table to bring us some water, but they didn't take our order. We waited another 10 minutes to at least see a waiter, and I finally got impatient, went over the bar, and asked who the hell we could give our order to because we had stuff to do besides sit around in an empty restaurant. Apparently there was some confusion over who was supposed to take our table, and instead of figuring out which of them should do it they though the best course of action was to ignore us completely, not smart.

Since we were already delayed a good bit due to the slow service, I decided to only get one appetizer for the table, the gator bites. I really love the flavor and texture of gator when cooked properly, and my mom or Nicole had never had it before, so I wanted them to try it as well. The pieces we got were pretty miniscule (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385694465\/in\/set-72157623503537096\/), and the plate as a whole wasn't much in size or appearance. They basically charge you for novelty, and then make it as generic as possible. In fact, the pieces were so small, some bites wound up being more breading than meat, really sad. The cajun ""mayeaux"" was also far too creamy, and too much mayo and not enough cajun.

I ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffe as my main lunch item, as I generally love anything cooked in a good roux. This was another tragic failure. The shrimp were not cooked properly, and the crawfish was virtually missing. The roux was a sloppy mess (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4386459240\/in\/set-72157623503537096\/), and even the cornbread was doughy instead of crumbly. Worst of all, there was NO flavor, it tasted so horribly bland. Etouffee is supposed to be one of the crown jewels of Creole cuisine and they butchered it.

My mom ordered the blackened chicken salad, which sadly was probably the best thing at the table, but unfortunately it too was still lacking any solid flavors. How you manage to cook something ""blackened"" and leave it devoid of any charred or spicy flavors is beyond me, but it looked like they just rubbed some red pepper on and prepared it normally. 

I didn't even bother trying Nicole's oyster po'boy, because the baguette was completely ruined (http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wedoitforlove\/4385695997\/in\/set-72157623503537096\/). The bread was practically crunching off like charcoal with each bite she took, and the oysters themselves were tiny and fried for entirely too long. The fries were edible, but overcooked as well, and probably sitting for a while because they weren't very warm.

How much of this horrible meal was due to it being Christmas week and them probably understaffed and under-enthused about having to work I'm not really sure, and I honestly don't care. If you're going to be open you should treat every day the same, and give customers the same quality of service you normally would, otherwise give everyone a 50% discount for your 50% effort.),(Boudreaux's Louisiana Kitchen was the first place my coworker and I went to in Charlotte.  Mostly because I was craving Shrimp and Grits!  It's been a while since I had some Southern food.

We started with the alligator bites, then had i had the jambalaya and my friend had ribs and fries. If you're a fan of Cajun food you'll like it here. It was very tasty.

Service was good, but since it was late in the afternoon, we were among only a few other people. I'd like to see the dining room and get a feel for the place when it's more crowded and lively.

Overall I'd like to give it a try again, but it's definitely a good spot for Cajun.),(Had dinner here with some co-workers and it was a nice experience. We had a table on the patio that is half inside and half outside and enjoyed some food and drinks.

I went for the Cajun Carbonara Dish. It was very good, had a lot of flavor, and a nice large portion too.

Yes, Sunday brunch on a sunny day is going to be busy and we were waiting for every one of the twenty minutes that the hostess said it would be. No fault there.

We started off with a plate of beignets, which had the required heavy dusting of powdered sugar and also a small pot of strawberry jam for dipping\/scraping. Very hot and very tasty. A nice starter while you look over the menu.

For mains, we each went with omelets or the crabcake benedict. Each was a good portion with plenty of filling and lots of hollandaise on the benedict. The hashbrown potato casserole was very yummt and the omelets also came with a small bowl of fresh fruit - blackberries and blueberries and such. Nice.

Very good coffee. Cappuccino was very good.

Service was good, ambiance was great and the food was very good.

We'll be back to Cafe Monte for sure.),(I've had Cafe Monte in my brunch\/breakfast sights for quite some time now. Just waiting for the right moment.....to no avail. I made it in closer to 1pm with my wife and started wavering on whether or not breakfast was the right call for sustenance. Cafe Monte was welcomed, despite my late rise. 

I had heard whispers of this French cuisine in the quaint corners of Southpark...bistro music filling the art-laden walls. I was happy to find all of these. The interior is welcoming, spacious and occupied by very cushy chairs. I was enthralled with the music. Timeless and tasteful for the French decor. 

I was a little put off by the host. We waited for a few minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting to be seated. A minor faux pas that can be fixed for sure. The service, once seated, was fast and friendly. 

I ordered the steak and eggs. A rather generous portion of sirloin, cooked medium rare, croissant, beautiful hash browns and eggs. My only hangup with this meal were my eggs. I had ordered them over medium and they were served waaaaay over hard. More along the lines of hard boiled. Rather displeased with the texture, but the rest of my plate made up for it. The steak is wonderfully cooked, flavorful and seasoned. The hash browns are served in a ""puck"" shape and need no ketchup. 

The coffee is also delightful. Black, bold and piping hot. 

I'd definitely venture back in to Cafe Monte. A few slight changes and they'll be a 4.5-5 star in my book! Oui!),(I was very excited to try Cafe Monte I can't really give a full review since I didn't eat a real meal here so I'll be back soon.  The outdoor patio is very nice and the service was excellent.  The desserts when you walked in looked amazing (note to self for my next visit).  The menu had the traditional french dishes and they had a nice special on a Prosecco which was just what I was in the mood for.  I opted for the endive salad I would highly recommend it was delicious and shared a meat and cheese plate that was nothing spectacular and fairly pricey.  I'm coming back to try some mussels for sure and maybe brunch:)),(A girlfriend and I grabbed lunch at Cafe Monte a while back and I'm happy to say it was solid. The best French cuisine in Charlotte? No. But a nice lunch choice if you're in SouthPark? Oui!

With French cafe cute insides, Cafe Monte hosts really great, attentive service and a nice array of items. I haven't been yet for an a.m. or p.m. meal, so I'll just focus on my lunch. I went with the B.L.T. with a side salad - damn good bacon, soft yet crunchy bread and a light touch of mayo, exactly the way I asked for it. The side salad was fresh albeit a bit heavily dressed. But I have to note that my friend's french fries were outstanding. I couldn't keep my paws off of those hot little frites. Good thing she shared! 

I definitely want to head back to Cafe Monte and try some more deliciousness.),(A nice little place, tucked away in Phillips Place.  I just happen to see it from the road and decided to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat.  It was a Tuesday night and the place had only a few tables occupied and as I wasn't in the mood for table service, I opted for the bar.

The wait and bar staff were all buzzing around..........except they were not buzzing around the customers.  There were multiple instances that the bar staff and wait staff gossiped about everything which was unprofessional - but considering the average wait staff aged looked to be barely out of the 20's I'll give them a break this time.
It took a while to get drinks....we had to ask for water......but we did get our order of a meat and cheese plate and an order of Crab & Lobster crepes.

The chesses and meat plates in this town continue to be small portioned and a bit disappointing......Vivace is the only game in town where you get a nice amount of everything.....Cafe Monte...take note.  The one plus is that they serve a VERY inexpensive breakfast during the week.

The main dish, which was shared between me and my GF was good...very rich.  All and all it was a good experience until the I was handed the bill which was fair pricing wise and had it returned to me with a larger around of over $10?  I asked the waiter and he had swiped my card for another larger bill.  He corrected the problem, but handed me the corrected charge slip that required a signature..but only one copy...the copy for the store....meaning if the correction didn't go through right I would have been screwed...so I had to ask him for my own copy.  

So in closing, taking away the factor of either inexperience or just plain non-paying attention wait and bar staff, Café Monte is a cute little café in South Park worth checking out.......if you have the same issues I did.......then one time might be enough *grin*.),(I LOVE Cafe Monte. My wife and I discovered Cafe Monte soon after we first moved to Charlotte. We purchased a living social and gave it a try. She got hooked on the Charcuterie and I on their steak and eggs. We both love their macarons too. I would also recommend their various crepes. The shrimp and artichoke and the lobster\/crab crepes. Oh yeah and the short rib baguette delicious, too! LOL

When my parents come and visit or friends from out of town, we always always take them to Cafe Monte for breakfast or a late lunch. And occasionally we'll walk by and order some macarons or a fruit tart to go.

The dining area and bar area are great. If you want to hang out somewhere fun and have a nice conversation with a friend you'll like the ambiance. The service is top notch as well. 

The prices might be high for some, but you can taste the quality in the food. In my opinion it's totally worth it. I'm really high on Cafe Monte and suggest that you give it a try. You won't be disappointed.)"

The interior is HUGE. Much larger than one would anticipate. Mounds of tables and a rather long, full-service and fully stocked bar. A conservative amount of TV's line the walls above the bar.

Sliders: Beef was so flavorful and smokey. A welcome aroma. Pretty sure on mini brioche buns. Perfect as a standalone or an app split amongst all diners. 

Mac n' cheese: Let's just say, if you don't end up getting it, I feel sorry for your taste buds. 

My fellow diners had a salad with fried chicken and the tiger shrimp wrap. The wrap looked nice and fresh. Would definitely consider for a lunch option. The salad looks great with nice helpings of lightly battered and fried...uhh fried chicken. I had the serendipitous opportunity to try a piece of the chicken. Divine. 

Next time, I'm trying the fried chicken as an entree. This place knows the way to a southerner's heart (in a good way). 

Looking forward to many visits in the near future!),(I'm going to go ahead and give Leroy Fox 5 stars for my first visit and here is why.

* No Wait (it was very busy but we lucked out)
* Awesome outdoor patio (could use a few more tables out there though)
* $6 absolute dirty martini (I thought that must be a joke)
* Zucchini Fries (amazing - 3 dipping sauces you will not be disappointed)
* Sliders (bacon jam - that is all I have to say)

Extra star for service Chelsea our waitresses was attentive and friendly.  

Cotswald had needed a place like Leroy Fox for a long time - family friendly and big bar with large TV's to watch your favorite games on!),(A month or so ago, I was lucky enough to check out Leroy Fox during their soft opening. And while I've been meaning to head back much sooner, I finally got a chance to check it out again last night! Overall, I'm thinking that Leroy Fox is going to be a neighborhood staple in Cotswold! 

Hubs and I rolled in on a Wednesday night, hankering for some fried chicken. What? Don't judge. It sounded delicious. The exterior of Leroy Fox features a really cool looking patio, surrounded by what looks to be a Lincoln Log\/Jenga-esque wall. There are plenty of cutouts and openings to ensure plenty of air flow. When the weather turns lovely, this patio will be a hoppin'.

Speaking of hoppin', the restaurant was super busy for a Wednesday night. Considering the number of TV's and comfy booths, it's no surprise. The place itself is warm and modern, yet Southern. There are tons of local influences from Poppy's Bagel chips to the decor to the locally named items. 

Because the place was perhaps abnormally busy on a Wednesday night, service was a bit harried overall. However, the food and beverage certainly made up it! Here's what I ordered...

Selwyn Avenue (cocktail): 5\/5: Wow. They should just name this happy juice. It's an Arnold Palmer esque (1\/2 tea, 1\/2 lemonade) but with a twist of Dragonberry rum. And it's yum. I also love that it's served in a mason jar! 

1\/4 North Fried Chicken: 4.5\/5: Super delicious, crispy fried chicken. This plate is served with a wing and a breast and both pieces were very flavorful and juicy. The breading on the bird is salted and peppered and perfect with hot sauce! 

Mac 'n cheese: 4\/5: This was one of my side items and I was scraping the bottom of the ramekin to get every last bite. It's creamy shells and it's delightful. 

Green bean casserole: 3\/5: The casserole was just fine, but nothing crazy or overly spectacular. If you love green bean casserole, you'll likely enjoy it. 

Cornbread: 3\/5: I fully appreciate that I received not one but two cornbread muffins with my meal. Score! This cornbread was solid, but dry. Hubs dunked his in gravy and ate it right up. 

Gravy: 4\/5: That being said, the gravy was tasty...and I'm not even a gravy lover! 

I can absolutely envision myself coming back to Leroy Fox for another helping of that practically perfect fried chicken and Selwyn Avenue cocktail. At an affordable $17 for the two ($9 chicken and $8 cocktail), my belly was full and very happy.),(Walking into Leroy Fox, it has white washed wooden walls, it's lovely, it reminds me of JCT in Atlanta.  Nice people, everyone smiled and said hello.  I ordered a bloody mary and a shrimp po' boy.  My friend ordered a starter of pretzel bites.  The server said she didn't really like pretzels that much, but she loved these.  I hear ya sister.  When they arrived, they were little fried pretzel nuggets, with ranch, cheese dip and honey mustard for dipping.  I am a sucker for condiments.  Yay!!  Pretzels good.  

My sandwich was a great size portion and the shrimp were fried and hot, my french fry barometer registered a ""wicky, wicky woooooow.""  So I was happy, the one thing that I was not pleased with was my $10 dollar bloody mary was supposed to have a shrimp garnish, I didn't get the shrimp skewer, so I was hoping I had a $5 bloody mary, but I still had a $10 on my check, WAH!!!!  I hate $10 cocktails in the daylight.  Day drinkin' should be a bargain.  

They do have really cute American Apparel t shirts, (with Vixen, sly fox and Leroy fox) you can pick one up for $20. And they are garnished with a shrimp skewer!),(Went here with the wife tonight. Because of our schedules, we usually have dinner late (Late usually being around 10pm, sometimes later) I went to my trusty Yelp app to find ""late night"" restaurant options nearby and poof, found Leroy Fox.

Driven by this place a number of times, but never knew that it would be so cool inside. Upon reading a few reviews from friends it was ""Go time!""

I really like the layout. Big tables. Very comfortable space in the dining room. You can sit at the bar, sit at big tables or booths. I know, that's just like everywhere. But this is different. It's cool. Trust me. The way it's set up if you're at a booth, you're not that close to the bar. So if you're on a date or something you won't have to be around too much rowdiness. 

It felt like just the right amount of tvs in there too.Some places have too many tvs and it's almost distracting. They hit that perfect balance here.

There's also a very cool outdoor seating area. I can see myself coming back for evening drinks or happy hour or something. Very cool outdoor area with tvs. 

Now onto the food and service. 

The menu looked awesome and we were super excited to try some of the things on the menu. Then we were informed that because of the time we could only order from the late-night menu. It was kind of a bummer since obviously the late night menu isn't as comprehensive. We had to compromise from our first choices. But my wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich and pasta salad. My chicken tenders and fries were pretty solid too. I look forward to coming back and trying some of their other specialties. 

The service wasn't bad. Our hostess got our drinks started and server took care of the rest. He was friendly and chill. He wasn't super attentive, but it was later in the night and things usually are slower. Overall the service was fine.

The prices were reasonable and they even have a cool selection of gifts\/shirts, etc.I could see myself buying a shirt one day. LOL

In any event, I like this place a lot, Definitely recommend it!),(Great vibe, especially for the area.  A welcome addition to the dining and drinking scene in CLT.  They are dong a great job.  More places n town should learn from them.),(Despite hailing from the Latin American capital of the US (Miami), I know my Southern grub. It's thanks to South Beach farm to table operations like Yardbird that really set my palate straight. Then I traveled to Charlotte where my local expert led me in the direction of recently opened, Leroy Fox. 

This gastronomy focused Southern pub features indoor dining options fit for anyone searching out a finely casual eatery or even an outdoor patio to welcome the hens looking to bask beneath a beating sun. The latter was our choice. Whether you're after a crafty cold brew or a serious spirit, there's a full menu of regional beers and mixology forward cocktails.

For starters, the hot pretzel appetizer arrived with a bouquet of dipping sauces. Between the cheese, honey mustard and ranch, I found my mini pretzels readily diving into the honey mustard time and time again. Then, feeling somewhere between good and glutton, I opted for the fried chicken salad. 

I mean, sure, I'll take some greens with my delicately fried tenderloins. Everything danced together wonderfully... naturally, considering fried chicken was in the room. Then again, at Leroy's, ""chickens are fresh, all natural, hormone free and blessed."" Yes, they're blessed... which must have something to do with how godly they taste going down.

Next time, I'm running for the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado).)"

After seeing the other locations in town, the location at the Met was definitely a good spot for them to land. 

First, being at The Met, you're in for a hell of a time finding a parking space. Next to impossible during a busy lunch hour or evening when everyone in Charlotte decides to shop at Trader Joe's. If you're lucky enough, snag a spot on the street for easy in and out of there. Not fun when you're on a time crunch for a meeting or getting back to the office. 

The space inside is pretty small. Not hospitable for 50 hungry, business professionals from Uptown. Standing room is limited. Get ready to brush some shoulders!

The order system is hilariously fun. You mark your order on designated bags with red sharpies and then they hang them above the makeline! Really fun to watch. With my imagination and heart being that of my 4-year-old self, I really enjoyed this. It makes it fun to order what you want on the sandwich and not go with the cookie cutter choices like other sandwich shops. 

The house chips are really good, too. Seasoned lightly and served in an innocuous paper bag. I appreciate that. 

I ordered the chicken salad. I probably added way too many toppings, but it was good. A bit on the creamy side, but the bread was thick and chewy. It made up for the overt creaminess. The buffalo sauce they have is a nice addition! I'm sure it would be great on just about any sandwich they have there. 

Pretty solid choice for lunch. Beware of crowds and parking crazies!),(I first experienced Which Wich in Texas. It was an instant hit with me. I was pleasantly surprised to see it in Charlotte. 

It has tasty sandwiches and lots of choices too. And just the way you want it. You pick a brown bag that accompanies the type of meat that you want and proceed to use a sharpie to fill in the meat, cheese, toppings and spread. just the way you want it and in a cool way. They also have chips, cookies, rice krispy treats and shakes. 

The sandwiches are very tasty and you can get a combo meal. They even do a punch card for frequent members for a free sub. 

This location is relatively new and the staff is especially helpful. Each time I've gone in, once I enter, someone comes from behind the register to greet me and ask if I've been there before and am familiar with the process of ordering. That's very cool. 

Prices are reasonable and the sandwiches are awesome. You definitely need to stop by and order a sandwich here.)"

No, it is sadly not and in the middle of no where. It neighbors a Latino clothing store and is on a street sparsely populated with random businesses like tanning salons and such.

On the up side this tiny little grocer (with little to no prepared foods), has a variety of Korean groceries which is hard to come by in this neighborhood. Their selection of fresh produce was extremely limited, and I don't even think they sell meat. But they do have Hi-Chews for only 99 cents, some frozen Korean ice creams, and a variety of instant noodles\/rices\/curries which is up my alley!)"

As a former waitress\/bartender - I was in this industry over ten years and I have a lot of patience when it comes to service - but this was just ridiculous.  I give this place 3 more months and it will be gone for good.

What really sucks is that I was really looking forward to a big improvement from the previous Charleys. Hoping to have a decent place to grab food and drinks in the neighborhood urgh...

So back to the service after ordering an appetizer that the waiter raved about  - the appetizer never came instead we were presented by the waiter with Calamari - how can you not tell the difference between fried green tomatoes and Calamari?  I asked the waiter if perhaps the Calamari was for another table if not we would be happy to eat it instead of what we ordered so it didn't go to waste.  Nope the waiter came back giggling isn't it weird I actually rang in Calamari - no I don't think its weird I think you should listen better and if you were a good waiter you would have taken care of your mistake...The waiter must have walked by 10 times without refilling drinks and the place was completely empty.  Dinner was ok nothing great my belly was full and I got over it....but the next night my neighbors want to go up to Charleys because on Fridays it $1 beer night at least it was $1 beer night....yup my neighbors had been going up there for the last 3 weeks for $1 beer night and as soon as we show up they tell us they stopped the special...hmmm strange wonder why the place was yet again empty on a Friday night at dinner time..

Yes one more time I order the fried green tomato appetizer that I ordered the night before but this time my food just never came ...everyone who ordered 15 minutes after me had there food but mine never came and once I could actually find the waiter they said they would check on it and blamed it on the kitchen....at least 40 minutes after I ordered the owner delievers my food no apology nothing hey not even silverware...yup this place is definitly not getting my business again... and sorry I don't like to write reviews like this but customers should be warned.)"

And there was much rejoicing throughout the land.),(Yay - a new hip coffee shop.  I didn't get to hang out very long but 
I could see myself sipping a latte, reading a book and getting cozy for awhile at Central.  It's a little hard to get to since you can't turn left from Central but its well worth the hassle.  Service was top notch, and my coffee was just perfect.  If your a coffee snob like me check this place out you won't be disappointed.),(I'm adding another star to Central Coffee...because it's officially my favorite coffee house in Charlotte. Some points that need to be made...

1) The coffee is really that good. I'm partial to an iced Americano, raspberry latte or spiced chai. If you are staying for a while, make sure to get your hot bevvies in an adorable mug.
2) The baristas are quite talented with their latte art. Check out the pics, but I've seen some gorgeous lattes.
3) The breads & pastries are damn delicious. Try the superloaf with a side of peanut butter or the zucchini bread. I've also had my eye on the pound cake for some time now...
4) Free WiFi, comfy seats and generally pretty quiet. 

Go to Central Coffee and get your caffeination on.),(Delicious, $3 large French press made with love from a spunky little barista. Three cheers for a locally owned business.  Least not forget about the cute little green and yellow cups. Color me caffeinated.

One of my MOST favorite thing about Central Coffee, it's like a library, really, no one is yapping on their phone.  In fact, I can hear my keys taping typing this review.  It's that quiet.  The music is low and when they make espresso, the humming of the machine and the baristas cleaning is soothing.  Weird, huh?

I also tried the breakfast casserole that Jimmy makes on the weekends, it is delicious! I have an appointment in 15 minutes and I do not want to leave. I want to stay in here where it's nice and quiet.)"

If you've never been, it's like a miniature Sam's Club, but with generic-brand products and no membership fees.  

If you need a cart, you may pick one up at the side of the store by depositing a quarter, which you may then retrieve by returning the cart when you're done w\/ it.  There usually is just enough room for two small-sized people walking side-by-side pushing carts one-way, so just keep this in mind as you go through the store and its mazes.  Just because most, if not all of the brands here are generic, it doesn't mean that Aldi doesn't sell quality stuff!  I was pleasantly surprised to find ORGANIC turkeys sold here the day before Thanksgiving.  Too bad all of them were about 12 pounds or larger, or else we'd have bought one to try, and I'd have one more thing to review here...

The reason I wanted to post something about my Aldi visit was to say that chocolate lovers must, if you haven't already, try a few of the European chocolates sold here!  You may find them among one of the first crates to your left as you enter the store and proceed forward.  Two brands we tried were Choceur [dark choc, milk choc, and milk choc w\/ almonds (those w\/ a hazelnut allergy would best stay away from the almond bar-- it contains hazelnut paste)] and Moser Roth (chili dark choc).  While the Choceur milk chocolate and almond bar was delicious (not too sweet!), I did feel the room spin as soon as I had a bite (I'm able to eat toasted hazelnuts w\/out problems, but hazelnut spreads and chocolate-covered hazelnuts do cause allergy symptoms).  I'm savoring a few pieces of the dark chocolate variety as I type this... Mmm, and it's so melt-in-your-mouth creamy-dreamy!  If you're a bit daring when it comes to mixing chocolate and peppers, then you may like Moser Roth's Chili bar.  I didn't find it as spicy as my baby sis did, but then again, she doesn't really like spicy dishes (she orders a ""1"" when at a Thai restaurant that serves dishes ranging a mild 1 to an inferno 5), but the flavors harkened to the times when I tried Mexican hot cocoa and churros made w\/ Ibarra chocolate....

My older sister's MIL LOVES the brownie mixes here!  I can't review it, as it contains corn products; However, the aromas that wafted throughout the house while it baked sure smelled delightful!

First time we went, we both had the sampler and the highlight were the salads. The French Onion Soup I had did not even have onions in it.

Last time was a even worse.  My wife order a Croque Monseiur with a Caesar Salad.  This is a basic Ham and Cheese Sandwich that was very dry and cheese was slightly burnt.

I had the French Dip au Caramelized Onions which is normally one of my favors.  The Roast Beef was dry with little flavor but more flavor that the hot brown water that was suppose to be the au jus.  Even the horseradish was more mayonaise that horseradish so this ended up being one of the least flavorful French Dips I have experienced.

Another large problem was the Coffee.  When we got to the Coffee Urns, they had just run out and had not replaced them with fresh.  We alerted the attendant to that.  15 minutes into our meal, we tried again and they were still empty.  Went to the cashier and asked for the manger who eventually took care of the problem.

The French Cuisine I am familiar with is delicate, moist and very flavorful with a lot of attention to detail and presentation. This Cuisine is not delicate, often dried out and presentation from what I can see, is not even addressed.

It's OK but if you're looking for true French, you'll be disappointed.),(Take Panera and the old style cafeteria and give it a French flare and there you have it.

A couple of things you need to know about La Madeleine.

1.  They are a chain out of Dallas, but not public traded on the market.  Just in case you love and want to invest.

2.  There is an audio of French language lessons in the restrooms.  I seriously felt like I was back in high school.

3.  There is free bread with fresh jam and butter.

4.  The ordering is cafeteria style.

5.  They serve breakfast food all day long.

6.  They cater.

7.  The French Onion soup is the bomb.

8.  The Quiche Lorraine was very fresh and very very yummy.

9.  They have soup, salad, sandwiches, omelets, french toast, croissants, muffins and more.

10.  They great you with Bon Jour.  Like for real.

11.  Prices are between $4.00 and $14.00.  Very affordable.

Don't get me wrong - it's all very high quality stuff that looks great and tastes better.

I did manage to pick up a few very interesting tasty items (TJ's Bohemian Lager, some horseradish infused hummus and a chocolate covered Panettone cake), but I couldn't possibly afford to do a weekly shop here!

The shelves are nicely laid out and stocked and the stuff looks very appealing. This is not the sort of store where you want to walk in hungry!

Parking is in the parking deck.),(Seriously, if hell had a parking deck this would be it. 

I never attempt to park on the first floor unless I am there at some completely random, bizarre, off-peak time on a week day. Other than that, bypass the first floor and go up to the third. Park near the elevator. 

Other than the farmers market or uptown vendors, this is one of my go-to spots for flowers. They last a long time and are a great price. It's also a good place to grab wine for dinner parties or events. You can always find something that matches your budget. Same goes for the cheese and spice sections, all well priced. 

The freezer section game is strong. I mean hello, they now even have cauliflower pizza crust. I love all their Indian food selections. Channa Masala and Garlic Naan make for a cheap and easy week night dinner. 

All the workers are abnormally friendly. So, if you're not sure on a product or can't find something you are looking for just ask. 

Warning: the registers are the definition of entrapment. There will always be some kind of treat that you do not need staring you in the face. Well, unless it's the dark chocolate peanut butter cups. You obviously need those. Trust me. You're welcome.),(This Trader Joe's is wonderfully placed in the Metropolitan shopping center right outside of Elizabeth and Myers Park. Love the location. 

I love that this locating always has tons of fresh herbs outside. You can always find some good basil or small mint plants outside. I've bout a few of these before and they plant really well. Although, good luck finding ideal soil if you live around Uptown. 

This location seems a bit larger than some of the others around Charlotte. They have all of the regular sections but they definitely have the largest selection of flowers on the left upon entering. You can't miss them. I've bought flowers from here multiple times and they always have beautiful calla lilies and sunflowers. 

The worst part about this location is the parking. Everyone knows it. It's always busy. Everyone is a terrible driver. Get ready to park on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th floor or not at all. You'll be driving around for quite some time before you're satisfied and happy with your first floor parking space.),(Oh TJ's...I love thee.

Well, now that I'm firmly planted in Charlotte I still love a trip to Trader Joe's - especially when I can score up some samples from the back bar. Niiiiice!

If you're familiar with Trader Joe's, then you pretty much know what to expect. Affordable produce, lots of organic eats and an array of deliciousness sprinkled throughout. I have a hard time getting *all* of my grocery needs here, but it's affordable and fun nonetheless. Because I don't know what you (reader) prefer for groceries, I'll just list out some of my faves:

Lacey's Chocolate Macadamia Cookies: I'm pretty much convinced someone has inserted some type of addictive substance into these thin, chocolately and toffee like gems. 

Affordable wine: I don't really mess with the 2 buck Chuck anymore, but they have a sweet selection of affordable wines. There is a $5 Montepulciano that is pretty delicious. 

Cheese: Just one example - TJ's crumbled goat cheese is about $5. At other massive grocery store chains it's about $10. This is the same quality and quantity. Save money.

Staff: The Trader Joe's staff here are so bubbly, warm and helpful. They will help you find whatever you need and make you smile in the process. 

Just a note for shoppers - Trader Joe's (well, at least this one in particular) doesn't carry some necessary things like aluminum foil, plastic wrap, garbage bags etc. Also, unless you are the most patient of people, I would NOT recommend hitting up Trader Joe's a) the day before a food focused holiday or b) on a Saturday afternoon. Parking can get pretty hairy and this store isn't that large. Happy shopping & happy eating!),(OMG... I thought 9am opening was a national standard for TJ's... but no, TJ's opens at 8am here!!),(First time visiting this store today. Up until now, I've generally gone to the Trader Joe's in Highland Creek. This one is much bigger and has a very pleasant decor.

The selection is very good considering that Trader Joe's does not carry as many items as the big box grocery stores. The quality of the produce was excellent and a good selection of packaged goods.

What struck me most was the staff. Very helpful and friendly. You could tell they enjoy coming to work and it showed.

It was a pleasure shopping here and we will be back.),(My favorite product from Trader Joe's is frozen mushroom tart appetizers.  I heat them in the toaster oven and serve my mother-in-laws homemade pear relish for dipping.     They are delish, little savory pie bites from heaven.   Sometimes I findT.J.s limiting  in their selections, I treat it more like a special treat when I am near one, more than setting out with my grocery list.),(I'm still discovering all the great things they sell here.....this time it was no salt bread and also had no sugar either.

This place continues to show me foods that are both tasty and better for me than much of the processed foods in other stores.),(Love Trader Joe's, but this locale is really bad! 
It's the MOST Inconvenient place to shop in the world!  It's almost like they don't want you to shop there.  Parking is a paid lot, or either a nightmare.  Who puts a super market in the middle of the city with no where to park?  Why would anyone do that?  After driving around looking for a spot on the street, we ended up parking across a busy boulevard two blocks away!

The entrance...  
Is very difficult to locate, so we walked up and down the street and around the block like idiots asking people if they knew how to get into Trader Joe's.  Again I ask...  Why?

The part where I give credit where it is due:
TJ's has earned major props for their friendly, helpful staff and for their fresh, organic and unique food selections.  My boyfriend and I also had a great time in their wine aisle, and for just under four bucks a bottle we got to enjoy a few bottles of good wine.  

Having said that, still I will never, ever, ever go here to this particular location again as long as I live.)"

It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be ""messed up""), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was as dry as can be, boxed mac and cheese would probably have been better, and I think there were two chunks of proscuitto, the size of a penny. I barely touched my meal, and pushed it aside.

When the bills came, I had heard him say they took the salads off the bills, which was great. I didn't see my bill, and was told everything was taken off. Which was a really nice gesture, but since we were expensing to the company, it was a time where I wished I was paying out of my own pocket. Overall, I would never dine here again. Servers really need to learn how to question the cooks if obvious ingredients are missing, and not hand dishes out one by one. The cooks should also know these standard dishes like the back of their hands and keep the food consistent.)"

Press offers great light snacky food, affordable wine and a nice, relaxed atmosphere. Hubs and I like to stroll over here, grab a seat outside and relax during happy hour. The view from Trade St. is always entertaining...especially a bit later during happy hour on a Friday. :) 

The cheese and meat plates are great and well priced for a light snack. And I have to say it, the servers are just fantastic. They are extremely knowledgeable in their stock of wine and they will go above and beyond if they are out of your first beverage choice. When Press ran out of my favorite Sauv Blanc, our friendly server brought me a similarly flavored glass on the house while she chilled a full bottle for us. 

And that 's the great thing here - you can purchase many of their wines and drink them in house. The best part? Their wine by the bottle is priced at retail, not restaurant markup. I'll absolutely hit up Press for a relaxing spot to grab a light snack and a glass of vino in the future.),(Press is the perfect place to grap a light snack and a bottle of wine.  Wine at retail prices instead of restaurant pricing, that is always a bonus.  It is a great place to sit outside, meet up with friends.  We had a work function there and it was a great space for a casual setting.  The managment and staff were very pleasant and approachable.),(Relaxed place with a nice...albeit dusty patio\/outdoor area.  

Like Dean & Deluca in Southpark...this place also serves sushi?????Which I really don't get?  Oh well.

Servers are very good and attentive though I find if you sit at the sushi bar it can be hit or miss.  Also, depending upon the staff and\/or day, I have found that staff sometimes get a bit wrapped up in ""duties of cleaning, fixing, organizing, stocking...rather than serving and waiting on customers, so that continues to be a disappointment for me.

I find the lighting to always too bright in this place as is the lighting out side on the patio...its a wine bar folks....not a grocery store?

Food for me has only involved lunch, which their sandwich menu reads like a Dean and Deluca-esk list, but the quality doesn't even come close.......though the pricing is right on.  I have to say, after a few times here at lunch, I'll only being drinking here going foward.

Furniture and decor just doesn't make sense to me.  This isn't a neighborhood bar...it actually doesn't even have a bar.  It is very laid back and if you can stand the noise from traffic...which is loud due to it being on a major through fair, then outside seating is better than inside.

I find folks like to use it as a jumping off point and for me, it is on my way home and on my way to the bars in the center of the city...or dinner places, so it will continue to be a favorite on my list........just not as much a favorite as the Wooden Vine of course *wink*),(Hands down, love the nighttime ambiance here. This place was made for mild romantic. 

...what a strange thing to say, you might offer. 

But, really -- it is. It's the kind of place where you can be unpretentious and undisturbed as you talk quietly to your budding love as the lights are dimmed and the music filters out on low. It's perfect for that casual romantic feel. 

Funny I say this, because I was there on my initial visit with a dear friend of mine and two colleagues.

And bonus: They have rotating nightly specials AND live music!

It's an interesting clash, though -- lively beers, delicious wines and sushi? But it works. Well, in fact. Try the extra spicy tuna roll. 

To. Die. For. 

I still had to add some wasabi but, really, I think that is only because my tongue was molded from volcanic ash or something.  

Ahh.... I would just love it if Press Wine would open a branch location in Tucson. Wishful thinking, I'm sure.)"

I ordered the Power Packed Chicken Salad sandwich - roasted chicken, low-fat mayo, dried cranberries and nuts on multigrain bread. Not only did it fill me up, but this healthy sammie packed a punch! The flavors were great, bright and perfect for a healthy lunch. I ordered a combo with my meal and scored some cheddar potato Popchips (this is the first place I've seen them in Charlotte!) and an iced tea. Their decaf detox tea is delicious, too - nice and refreshing! Plus, their menu lists the nutrition content which I really respect. 

My combo came to just under $10 when all was said and done. Price wise, it's a bit more than other sandwich locales, but the organic ingredients and nutritious outlook is worth a few bucks more to me. 

I also noticed that they have teeny little cups for free froyo if you purchase a combo. Yesterday's flavor was pistachio - and while I didn't have any, it looked froyolicious. In terms of a healthy, flavor packed meal in Uptown - Energy Cafe is the one of the best of the best fo shizzle.)"

Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of ""compact"" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.

Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.

While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.

Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.

For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.

I kid you not, my wife said ""That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States."" So it has that going for it.

George's will likely be our ""go to"" spot for romantic evenings.),(Two words: Fiery Mussels.

I came here for happy hour yesterday evening. Wow, what a great crowd. I knew they must be doing something right when I saw how many people were there.

They have specials every night... but last night it was martini night. I hit for cycle on the martini menu. My personal fav was the Berry Martini.. and this is coming from a girl who lives and dies by a dirty martini. Yeah, the Berry was that tasty. The French was also great. Let's be honest, they were all pretty fantastic.

My friend and I got a variety of food. Fat kids, party of two. It was all amazing, but let's get back to those mussels. Peppers, onions and chorizo in a spicy sauce. I couldn't stop dunking pieces of bread in it. I may have went through a loaf. At one point, I was dipping fries in it. I would probably have taken shots of it if other people weren't around to judge me. 

I love oysters and they have a great variety here. So fresh and perfect with all the fixings. The butter poached lobster was another fav... served with potato gnocchi and black garlic beurre blanc. Little pillows of goodness.

We also had one of the steak dishes and the pan seared scallops. Both were cooked to perfection. The scallops had sweet corn puree, fava beans and smoky sauce. Great flavor combination.

The service was just tremendous. Our server Laura was on point. So friendly, professional and fantastic at her job. Every staff member and manager who came by were the same way.

Hats off to the chef and everyone here. I left full and happy. I can not wait to come back to this place again.),(You know, I've put off reviewing Georges for weeks - and until today I couldn't quite decide why. Well, here's why - I expected more. That's right, I expected more from Georges. And while my meal and experience wasn't a bad one, I was really hoping it was more than just ok. But for because of the latter half of the meal, I left feeling a bit ""meh."" 

A while back hubs and I made it out to Georges for a casual meal on the patio. Before sitting down I took a peek inside and it's a similar layout compared to the previous tenant (Oceanaire). I can't speak too much to the bar or inside dining area, but they looked luxe. So, how about the meal? Here's the rundown:

Complimentary bread & butter: 5\/5: Wowza. Crusty, delicious bread with real creamy butter. Delightful on all accounts. I had to hold myself back from theifing the bread basket. 

Goat cheese & onion tart: 4.5\/5: By far the best part of the meal for me. Our server ""warned"" us that the tart comes out lukewarm, not hot, but to my delight it came out toasty. It was generous in size, full of flavor and delectable. I would go back just for this tart and request that it comes out toasty. 

Tuna Nicoise: 2\/5: A deer would have loved this dish because it was a true salt lick. As in so salty I could barely get it down. The ogre heavy hand of seasoning ruined anything good that might have been going on with this dish. I barely had three bites. Could I have mentioned this to my server? Yeah, I could have but I only saw him twice during my meal before he dropped off the check. Thank goodness the water guys were paying attention to my glass because it was routinely emptied. 

Creme brulee: 2.5\/5: The flavor was decent, but the consistency was not. The top of the brulee was, um, barely bruleed and the inside was not cooked quite enough. Sad brulee, sad Nicole.  

Will I come back to Georges? Sure, but I'll try completely different dishes, save the goat cheese onion tart.),(I have been to George's three times and I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either.  I thought it was an over priced South Park restaurant. Today I went with one of my friends and we had a great lunch.

We shared a goat cheese\/onion tart to start.  It had a strange consisitency, like pureed onion, but still had a good flavor.  Then we had a lamb sausage sandwich and I ordered the special fried flounder sandwich.  They did not pass my french fry barometer.  French fries not served piping hot just pisses me off now.  I know, I know, I know,,,, I know they would have been more than happy to bring me hot fries but, dang it, I want my fries hot without having to ask.

The best part of our visit today was our service.  Our waiter saw that we had cash on the table and he told us the gratuity was added because we used a coupon from restaurant.com.  He gets a gold star and he got double tipped anyway for being honest.

George's also has a raw bar and offers a happy hour menu that is worth checking out.),(So a Sunday morning and I'm growing weary of the brunch places in town, so I decided to try something different.

Georges came to mind as I've heard folks talking about it for some time and a person I use to know liked the place.

I always sit at the bar to the left and down mimosas like it is my last meal.  Bar staff is cool and talkative.

Bruch is the only time I've been here, but always a fun time, though I have eaten on the patio one time.),(My wife and I and some friends tried out Georges Brasserie several months ago during restaurant week. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. 

The Slow Braised Short Rib was excellent. I also had a cold soup which had an interesting, refreshing taste to it. I also enjoyed the cocktails that I had. 

The dining room itself is nice and our server was pretty good. The place is a bit pricey so be prepared. Overall we enjoyed our dinner and I would definitely come back for a repeat.),(During my trip to Charlotte, NC, my family and I had an opportunity to dine at George's Brasserie. It is now one of my favorite French restaurants and I am sad that it's all the way in the East Coast!

Isabella was our server for my latest trip here and she was amazing from start to finish. For my two friends, it was their first time. She completely walked us through the menu and gave great recommendations. My must-order item here is the Kung Pao Cauliflower. Even if you think you don't like cauliflower, you'll love this. The street corn (miso mayo is delicious) and cajun gumbo are both solid. BBQ shrimp and sushi rice tuna poke are great, too. I am a huge fan of the Wu Boil. You pick your seafood and your flavor (7 to choose from). I like the Chunky Cajun. Each come with corn, potatoes, and sausage. I usually do the 1\/2 lb of shrimp ($16). It's a good sized portion for me. I think the entire menu is reasonably priced. 

If you're not feeling the boil, the gumbo ramen is fantastic. They make all the noodles in house. One of the biggest surprises on the menu for me is the fried chicken sandwich. So good. I'm not a huge dessert person, but this last time we did get the grilled pineapple foster to share. Beignets, toasted peanuts, grilled pineapple, ice cream- yes. 

The She's a Lychee is my go-to cocktail here. I'm not an old fashion fan, but I did really like the Blacked Ol' Fashion. The House Cajun spiced rim is money. The Hurricane Kasa-Obake is not as sweet as it looks. Love that it has the coconut lemon grass sake in it.

Founded a little over 20 years ago in Columbus Ohio, these guys have made a science of all styles of BBQ. Rather than just one style of BBQ, they have studied all and have have pretty much mastered all of them from Eastern NC style called a Lolo to the tomato based Lexington style to Mustard Based SC Style to Memphis to Texas Brisket to St. Louis Ribs.

They showcased all of these and more and we got a chance to try smoked turkey, smoked Texas Sausage, BBQ Chicken, Pulled Pork, Texas Brisket and a full rack of St. Louis Ribs along with a number of sides including BBQ Beans, Potato Salad,Corn Pudding, Hush Puppies and for desert, Banana Pudding.

Out of all of this, the only thing I did not like was the Hush Puppies which were a bit greasy on the inside.  That said, forget the hush puppies because there are so many other things to dine upon and not fill us the the Hush Puppies.

Very open and friendly staff and between on of the original founders, the store manager and dining room manager, they made us feel right at home. We had a chance to see the smokers both inside and out, the kitchen prep area and had several demonstrations on the proper way to serve the meat.

Anyway, we popped in here at like midnight after a show at the Ovens Auditorium. A few tables outside were still open as were some inside. And seats at the bar.

A nice two-top table with a view of the door was available, so we nearly settled into that except the table was soaking wet as was one of the seats. No worries, they were both wiped down with the same cloth (the table first, not like it matters). Okay, this is off to a good start.

Drinks were ordered and then we got into food. I chose the simple single burger with cheese. Note that it doesn't come with fries. A nice sized patty with all the usual toppings, it was tasty and filling. Good. My wife had the open roast beef sandwich, with comes with mashed potatoes (with gravy) but were clearly packet potatoes. The beef was okay but she really liked their slaw. Nice thinly shredded cabbage with just enough vinegar.

Hard to complain when you walk out after spending less than $25 and it was still open that late.),(Reverse angle parking. Still dumb. Still refuse to do it. I'll walk here if I have to or roll the dice and hope there's a spot in their tiny parking lot. 

The Diamond is a true Charlotte institution. One part old school diner, one part dive. All parts badass. 

If you can't find something you like on this menu, well the problem maybe you then. There's a little bit of everything. You'll find some of the best fried pickles in the city here. Among my favs: pig wings (deep fried pork shanks, get 'em. You're welcome), gravy fries (make sure to get pimento as well), onion rings, small block burger (add cheese, all the way), pork chops, meatless loaf (and I'm not a vegetarian), and the Dixie chicken sandwich. They also have homemade desserts and a full service bar. Choose those extra calories wisely. 

I love to sit on the patio here and people watch. Plaza Midwood, don't ever change. This is a great spot to grab some grub before (or after) hitting up Legion Brewery which is right across the street.),(Don't really need to throw in another ""Oh, how the Penguin was oh-so grandiose back in my day blah blah blah"" kind of story with ties to the Diamond. The Diamond is your typical greasy spoons kinda place with all of the fried fare your body can handle for a heavy lunch, late-night bender, or overt pig out. 

Keep true to my favorites of old, the Small Block -- Southern Style is my go-to. The chili and slaw atop a nice, flattop burger sings happy tunes to the greasy glands in my brain. Crinkle cut fries round it out to really make you hate and love yourself at the same time, too. 

Love the feel of this spot. The layout feels weirder and weirder upon every visit. Not too many seats to fight over in this joint. Waits can get a little lengthy, but most people are in and out while keeping popularity in mind. 

Count me in as part of the Diamond fan club.),(There has been a whole lotta buzz about the Diamond in recent weeks, hasn't there? And no, I'm not going to hash out a review about their history and challenges that resulted in the final product...y'all can research that yourself. I'm here to talk about the food! And the service :)

After waiting it out a few weeks, hubs and I finally rolled into the Diamond at 6:15 pm on a Monday night in hopes of avoiding an astronomical wait. And, cha-ching! No waiting. Our server Jason got to us pretty quickly and set us up in a booth with drinks within minutes. The interior of the Diamond is really great - shiny, vinyl booths, kitschy wallpaper, sweet sized bar near the back. I really dig the color scheme - the place looks wonderful.

A couple things to note...they were out of many items. I realize they are still going through some kinks and, unfortunately, it shows. The menu is quite large and I can only imagine how tough it's been to gauge inventory with long lines and a hefty menu. Since a good deal of the pent up anxiety about the Diamond revolves around the food, here's what I indulged in & how it fared:

Fried pickles: 3.5\/5: Tasty slices of pickle-y love & a very generous portion - even for a half size. Yes, that's $3.95 for a boatload of fried pickles. These little babies came out piping hot with a side of ranch. My only gripe? The breading was pretty plain and the ranch was fairly thin. A little spice would kick this dish right up to 5 stars for me. 

My meal: I chose the quarter fried chicken plate, a steal with two sides and your choice of biscuit, cornbread or yeast roll. While I was yearnin' for some cornbread, they were out of it. *cries* Oh well, I went with a biscuit, green beans and a baked sweet potato. 

Fried chicken: 4.5\/5: This rivals my grandma's fried chicken. Crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned with just a touch of grease. Hey - it's fried chicken...a little grease is good. The meat was juicy tender and freakin' delicious. 

Green beans: 1\/5: I barely stuffed two beans in my mouth. These tasted straight out of the can with a pound of salt added. Serves me right for ordering a non-fried veg. 

Baked sweet potato: 4\/5: Yes. It was a baked sweet potato! No butter required. 

Biscuit: 3\/5: A good biscuit, not a great one. I have to admit that I compared this biscuit to Dish's and it just didn't quite measure up. Nevertheless, the Diamond swings a soft biscuit and it went well with the fried bird on my plate. 

I vacillated between 3 & 4 stars for the Diamond, but ultimately went with 4 stars because of the value you get from the food, the fun & vibrant ambiance and overall potential. I'll be back!),(Been a long time since I was here but today was a big disappointment.

Probably been at least seven years since I have been here but it was one of two places in Plaza Midwood that I liked. The other was the Penguin which closed last year.

Both were Charlotte Institutions and places to go late night for a late dinner. Both were good diners with National Reputations. and always had good food.

Have a list of places I want to try but with Road Construction, two were eliminated quickly and will have to get at a later day so i settled on Diamond.

Walked in and was seated shortly thereafter in a nice booth. Server was there to give me a menu and take my drink order.  

Looking over the menu, I was in luck. There Seafood was one of my favorites, a Fried Oyster Plate. Ordered that with the Vinegar Slaw etc and pulled out the smartphone to check the latest headlines.

About two minutes later, the server showed up with a menu and informed me they were out of oysters and I needed to try again.,

Decided on the 1\/2 Fried Chicken and upgraded to all white with sliced tomatoes and Fried Okra with a biscuit as my side.

I was shocked how quick the order came out. If it was made from scratch, one of the fastest turn arounds of an order. Either that of I last track on time which is possible.

Nice presentation. 

However the food did not measure up to the presentation. 

I knew to start with, I was taking a chance on the Sliced Tomatoes but there are still some Vine Ripened Tomatoes that taste like real tomatoes rather than flat. These had no real tomato taste to them at all.

The Okra was good and that brings us to the Chicken.  There were four pieces of Chicken One was a breast and one was a wing and I know they consider a wing to be white meat
( I don't) but the other two pieces were a drumstick and a back.  Have never seen backs and legs considered as white meat.

Chicken was very bland. The Drumstick was under cooked next to the bone. The other pieces were OK but very bland and the batter that they were covered with had no distinct taste at all.

At least they could have used the traditional Southern Seasoning of Salt and Pepper in with the flour but I could taste one of that.

Another catch at the end. When my check arrived, I looked at it and immediately register a look of shock. Total Bill was almost $28 dollars and I knew it should be closer to $14 - $15.

Server saw  my shock and we both took a look at the bill and the Oysters they were out of were still on the bill.

It was promptly removed.

Service was OK, atmosphere somewhat of a Dive but it was for years and that leads to the charm of the place but the food preparation leaves much to be desired.),(There is some magic in the air about The Diamond, first of all the restaurant has been around Charlotte since 1945, it's kitchy and cozy.  The guys who took it over, polished it up without overdoing it or making it too cool for school.  It is packed tightly with tables, I don't remember it being so compact on my last visit, but it works.

The powder, deep, robin's egg, Tiffany box.... blue vinyl booths give me a hard on.  I didn't know I was going to the Diamond on this sneak peek night, but Julia S. and the Mister texted me, so I headed over.  Since I wasn't hungry, I just ate a Winky Dinky dog and a shit ton of their french fries smoothered with pimento cheese and vegetarian gravy.  Jeez Louise.  I wonder what I would have consumed if I were hungry. Har, har, har.  Really, I don't even like gravy on my french fries and I could not stop eating.

The Winky Dinky dog was served on a split top white bread bun, sent straight from white bread forbidden hell and it was delicious.  It really tasted like it was fried and finished on the grill, complete with the grill taste-   4th of July when you were a kid kinda taste, topped with chili and pimento cheese.  I added raw onion and yellow mustard and called it a day.

I checked my Magic Eight Ball for the Diamond's future. Will The Diamond succeed?  It is decidedly so.),(Gotta love the Diamond. 

It's the first place that my wife and I tried when we moved to Charlotte; our first taste of the south. 

And it was tasty. I remember ordering fried pickles for the first time, a cheerwine for the first time, along with fried chicken and fries. It was very satisfying. I've been back a few times since and it always hits the spot. It's a little greasy so I try not to make too many trips, but it's really good. 

It's open late, has a fun crowd and although it's small it doesn't feel that small. I really like the vibe in here. It has a character of its own and I like it a lot. If you're in Charlotte, you've gotta try it!)"

They bring you both a mild and spicy salsa with your chips. Pro tip: ask for the green salsa as well. Spicy and delicious. When asking for queso, make sure to specify dip or else you'll end up with a side of shredded cheese. 

Tuesdays can get pretty busy here for dollar authentic tacos. I like that they have a long list of options for this (chicken, steak, chorizo, veggies, beef tongue, shredded beef, chunky or roast pork). Most places skimp on $1 nights and only give you a couple choices. Aside from dollar taco night, the entire menu (especially for lunch) is pretty cheap. 

Nice covered patio. The bathrooms are located in the space between La Unica and Kickstand.

In addition to just having a fantastic wine selection, they also serve food which we also had a few items off the menu which ranges from creative cheese plates to full meals, all of which are reasonably priced.

With plenty of seating and a nice little bar, one can savor many different wines.  For this visit we went both red and white, but in the end chose a nice light white wine for drinking at home at a later date.

The wine selection is wild!  2 big rooms of a huge selection, so if you are looking for good wine and want a great selection, then check out the Wine Shop.

Your check is brought to your table and you walk up to the register to pay. I love the old glass case that houses hershey bars, mentos and other candies that have probably rested there for years. 

If ever in the 'Wood during breakfast time, John's is choice. It's a Charlotte landmark in my eyes.),(It's a rarity to find a legit, family owned diner these days. You know, the one where mama is in the back cooking, her son is at the grill and plenty of teasing happens. That's the epitome of John's Country Kitchen. It's definitely a family affair and it works really well (per an outsider's view). Service is sweet and straight forward - they'll take care of you and be sure to tell you how long you'll be waiting. 

The menu is pretty straightforward with a matrix of egg and meat combinations. I chose the veggie omelet with turkey sausage. It was a nicely cooked, sizeable fluffy omelet with oodles of tasty turkey sausage, plenty of veggies and served with an hearty side of potatoes and biscuits. While I've heard the biscuits are incredible here, they tasted off to me...just like biscuit mix (too much flour maybe?). Bad biscuit day, perhaps? No worries, though, I had so much food with my potatoes and omelet, I wasn't lacking. I also tasted a pancake - thin, golden brown and delightful. Affordable deliciousness. 

With a warm diner environment, solid coffee and good eats, John's Country Kitchen is a great place to grab a bite. Cash only, folks!)"

Libretto's is pretty basic inside: a front room with a handful of hightops and a back room with standard tables and TV's (I have never been back here). Every time I've been in here (granted it's been after 9 pm each time), I've found tons 'o intoxicated peeps and some folks who were working way too late at the bank of choice.

We both agreed it is inedible, and a $21.00 pie will go in the garbage.  I tried putting it in the microwave, but that seemed to make it worse.  It wasn't breaded chicken on the pizza, but bits of what tasted like a flavorless chew, and there was hardly any cheese on it.  

To their credit, the order taker was very pleasant.  They got the order correct and their cannoli was delicious.),(This is one of our favorite pizza delivery places.

Seems like a great idea on paper... not so sure though in real life. 

Pros: 
-If you want to see the hot new movie on opening weekend, you can buy tickets ahead of time online... and even pick out your seats. Saves you all that hassle of going to a theater early and waiting.
-SMG validates parking. This is HUGE because that Epicentre deck is ridiculous. The validation is good for up to four hours.
-The seats are super comfy. It's like being on a couch.
-The service was great. There was an army of servers manning our theater. Which leads me to the cons...

Cons:
-There's an army of servers roaming around the theater. Talk about distraction dot com.
-They keep a light on in the theater. 
-It's not quiet. The booming bass from Kazba next door plus all the noise from people eating, ordering food, servers moving around... it's a lot.
-Alcohol served in a theater. There will be at least one drunk person in your movie. In my case, it was the couple next to me... hammered. And all over each other. No, they were not teenagers... they were like 40.

There are certain times when it makes complete sense to come here. But if you're straight up just wanting to really enjoy a movie... I would recommend going somewhere else.),(Bottom line: Go for a movie, not the food. 

We went to a matinee recently and were impressed with the experience. Very, rather. The girl at the ticket counter was gracious and charming, the staff throughout the theatre were charming as well, and the seats.....I wanted to take one home. They are the most comfortable seats in any theatre I've ever been to. The biggest plus about seeing a movie here (since it's the EpiCentre) is validated parking. That'll seriously save you some dough and will help you forgo a walk through nasty weather, should it be one of those days, to park in the EpiCentre's garage. 

Mondays are the day to go if you want to drink whilst watching your choice film. Half off house margaritas? Yes, please. They are actually pretty good, too. They even do this thing called a ""metldown"" that gives you an extra shot and some other goodies. They'll even tailor your marg to your liking. Nice touch, SMG. 

We ordered the duo dip. Meh. Save yourself the disappointment. It was just wrong. The cheese was a brick of GROSS and the guac stuff was a little off. The cracker-y things tasted stale. Definitely wouldn't order it again. However, I'm happy to report that the popcorn is fantastic! $5 gets you a gracious amount, too. 

Suffice is to say that I really dig SMG....for the movies. I'll definitely look forward to coming back soon!),(I've been here a few times,  I've seen first run movies and had pretty good food.  Nice option for the dinner and a movie experience:

*Service  - Wait staff can be slow at times, but the staff is always friendly and polite.  It's great to pick your seat before the show, but every seat has a good view of screen.
  
*Atmosphere - The sound is clear.  They've got a full bar in the waiting area, if you'd like to get your party started before going in.  The dress is neat casual. The décor is modern and trendy with movie memorabilia.  There are a lot of couples but there are also groups of friends too.  The bathrooms are always very clean, and my understanding is that there are ""attendants"" in the men's room.  I guess dudes need special help with their bodily functions.   

*Food - Everything I've had was served at optimal temperatures and was okay, not great, but they do have fairly ""exotic"" fare (for a movie theater) such as coconut chicken (which is nice). 
        Huge salads if you're into that. My nephew had the pizza and it looked like cardboard with cheese.  It tasted like frozen pizza.  So don't get the pizza!   
       Also the drinks with alcohol are quite watered down, so if you get an ""adult"" beverage stick to beer unless you want to pay for ice and food coloring.  
       I've never had the desserts, but the selection is considerable.  
       Its rather nice to eat out of real dishes and flatware while enjoying a movie. 

*Cost - About average.  Unless you add alcohol,  then your tab will skyrocket!  Buy your tickets on-line for more convenience and savings (shout out to Groupon).
***Parking: They validate your parking.  So DON'T forget to bring that in or end up paying about $7-$12 for parking too.),(It's a movie theatre that serves food. Great concept, right? We went to see Anchorman 2 on New Year's Day but somehow missed the ""grill"" part and ate beforehand- bummer. The seats have little trays and buttons to call a server to you while the movie is rolling, which is cool- surprisingly, they don't really disturb you when they're serving other people in the theatre. I don't think I even noticed them roaming around while we watched the movie.

Anyway, the problem with Studio Movie Grill is the whole ""seating assignment"" thing. We went to see a movie a couple weekends ago and were sadly disappointed that there weren't two seats together anywhere in the theatre. I noticed this when we went to see Anchorman as well- the seat assignments were almost at capacity but the theatre was not. What is that about? We ended up skipping the movie last time and ate dinner at Vida. Bust.

Next time I'll order tickets online and well in advance.),(Great concept but bad execution!!! I went there and the place is clean and the seats are comfortable and the food was pretty good. 
However, I ordered a drink and large popcorn at the bar before the show for about $20 and was told that there was unlimited refills for the popcorn. 
When I asked for a refill of the popcorn while in the movie the ""waitress"" was totally confused. She told me that only applies when you are in the movie and I told her that doesn't make sense since I bought it 50 feet from the doors of the actual movie. She then replied that you still have half the popcorn left and I told her again that I'm getting a refill because I asked for little butter and as she can easily see that the popcorn was floating on top of the popcorn. 
She agreed and gave me my popcorn.
So it's check out time and I get the bill for drinks, ice cream and the popcorn. Ugh I didn't want to make a scene at the very end of the movie like others and I can wait. The problem is who wants all those distractions of people arguing about their bills in the middle of a movie? 
I guess I can see like others in a place offering too much can get too confusing and it's a distraction. 
Good luck!!)"

The spare ribs are very tender, as the meat falls off the bone with a touch of the fork and are well sauced and delicious. The octopus is like a meaty soup with a little heat that was quite nice.

I had the duck, and it was fantastic. Fat rendered just right and the gnocchi was some of the best I have had. I had a taste of the boar and it was quite good too.

The hard part was dessert. Normally there are 2 or 3 items that really stand out for us, but here we wanted to have everything, lol. So ended up getting a carrot cake and a peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. All the items are made by the owners mother, and you can taste it. Super good!

Came in for an early dinner and sat at the bar. We were pumped after our previous visit so we figured the rest of the menu had to be promising. Not so much.

I ordered the baja burrito. Yuck. It was so bland and glittered with overpowering cumin flavor. A sneeze of black beans, weak, dark meat chicken, and, the worst decision of all, was that it's pressed. NOT the best flavors as the tortilla was rather burnt in places. No thanks. 

We ordered the guac to share and it was fine. They did say ""made to order,"" though. It was freezing cold. Flavor was fine, but disappointing for the price\/serving size.

Frustrating visit to the Outlets but since it was lunch time, decided to try someplace I had not been to in the area. Used to like the Hwy 55 up our way but after 6 months, service dropped off and have not been back since.

Wanted to see what this one was like.  Walked up the door and one of the employees greeted me on the sidewalk, opened the door for me and took me by the arm and escorted me into the building. All of this while welcoming me. As soon as I was through the door a number of employees shouted out greeting as well.

I was made to feel at home and this is how the one up our way started out.  This location has been open a little over a year and they seemed to have maintained that enthusiasm.

Told to sit where ever I wanted so I chose a booth and sat down and a server was t here immediately to take my drink order and bring me my menu.

I initially thought about the current special of a two hot dog combo but decided instead on the John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich along with fries. I was given a choice of grilled or fried and since I'm trying to watch my diet, I chose the grilled. Note: Fries are a separate menu item and not served as part of the sandwich.

While I waited, I looked over the restaurant and it's a typical Hwy 55 or what used to be Andy's before re-branding.  50""s theme with color of pink and light blue or should I say, Art Deco with vinyl records and other items from the time on the wall. The ladies wear pink shirts with the name Pink Ladies in a reference to Grease. Piped in music is more 60's that 50's but at this point in time, does not matter. Good through back.

The John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich is quite good and more than a mouthful. The Sauce on it tends to overwhelm the taste of the Chicken. Biggest distraction was the tomato which unfortunately was on the crispy side if you can believe that (under ripe) with little taste. Maybe as we get later into the season and we have more local produce, this problem will disappear.

Fries were pretty good. Nice an crisp and not raw in the inside like so many other places server them. This place does them right.

If you're in the Charlotte Premium Outlet area, this is a great place for lunch.  It's on the north side of I-485 while the mall is on the south side, if you exit the Mall to the north, you end up on Shopton Rd and the restaurant is on the right in a strip mall.  If you come out on Hwy 160, turn left and go over I-485 and the restaurant is on your left.

Fun fact: Catch On Seafood (Plaza Midwood) uses these house made tortillas in their Taco Tuesday kits they do. After that, order your proteins. Everything is delicious- the marinated chicken, carnitas, barbacoa. Don't get thrown off when you order the chicken, it comes as pieces on the bone. You will need to shred it yourself. You can also buy queso fresco here.

At the register, you'll find different types of homemade salsas. I think this used to be a cash only place, but my latest visit here they took a credit card. I went a little overboard this time, but I wanted to feed a lot of people. My order: 1 lb (ish, a little more) marinated chicken, 1 lb barbacoa, 1 lb carnitas, 2 lbs of tortillas, 1\/2 lb of queso fresco, and two salsas. Grand total: $38. That's a TON of food for less than $40. This would be a great option for parties or tailgate spreads. 

There are also coolers of drinks and other offerings in the store, but for me I'm just here for the taco goodness.)"

Starting with a seaweed salad, it was nice to see the portion placed on top of a small pile of iceberg lettuce. I thought that this was pleasing and certainly added to the salad.

For mains, we chose the Snow Roll and a mix of other nigiri and sashimi. The snow roll was excellent. Really tasty, well stuffed, perfectly rolled mix of fish and rice and the pink paper. Nice to look at, great to eat. The tuna sashimi was sliced thick and extremely delish. Very meaty, very good tuna flavor.

Serious points for Yama. Very good stuff! Will return for sure.),(Mmmhhmm just like Dan K. says, order enough sushi and you are served via boat. Who doesn't want to eat off of a mini yacht? 

Yama has some solid sushi - some of my favorite in Charlotte. For some time hubs and I would only hit up Nikko, but I'm not keen on the bumping beats after 7:30 pm, so we sought sushi elsewhere. Yama is situated in the super sweet Morrison shopping center with a plenty of parking. Inside, it looks like a pretty standard, upscale sushi bar - a smattering of tables in the back and front and an actual seated sushi bar. It's pleasant inside, but it's not ""tricked out"" like some other sushi locales. 

The food is delicious. Hubs and I have tried a variety of their rolls and I haven't had anything less than super as of yet. Their fish is very, very fresh and they do have a bunch of creative rolls. Some of my personal favorites are: Snow roll - a rice paper wrapped fish fiesta, the Charlotte roll and the Firecracker roll. It's also nice to see that there are only very few rolls that are super fried or stuffed with cream cheese. That's just not my bag.

The edamame was tasty, steamed just enough and salted to our liking. Their hot food, from what I've tasted, was quite good as well. Standard dumplings and Hibachi. 

The staff at Yama are attentive and helpful, yet wisely let us hammer down our sushi in peace. The owners are there quite often and they are always very kind and grateful that we came in, whether it's for takeout or for dinner. 

Yay for Yama, a traditional sushi experience!),(So many people have insisted that this is the best sushi spot in Charlotte. 

I don't know. I didn't dislike it, but I think that I fell victim to it being overhyped. It's always better to go somewhere when the bar is set reasonably high and not too high. I enjoyed my rolls since I'm rather easy to please, but I didn't leave feeling as though I had a life-changing experience.

now onto the menu and food...I like the menu. I noticed that they have a lot to choose from. We had some gyoza and edamame. For the rolls, we had the tempura roll, lobster and spider roll. They were all pretty good.

The service and prices were fine. My wife and I actually really liked the look of the dining room too. Nice place.

Overall I'd recommend it, but I am quite reluctant to even suggest that it's the best of anything. But it's pretty good and I enjoyed it. If I could, I'd probably give it a 3.5 stars, but 4 will suffice. And since I only ate here once I'd definitely give it another chance.)"
O5AjarihqW1V8RlJnoef9A,"Hot Dogs, Burgers, Sandwiches, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.2240131,-80.8464728,Matt's Chicago Dog,76,4.0,"(I love love love crossing off bookmarks and there's nothing quite like deleting one from nearly a year and a half ago. Yes, it's April 2012 and Yelp tells me that I've had Matt's bookmarked since December 2010 after reading Cassandra's ROTD. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/matts-chicago-dog-charlotte#hrid:Kn7dQhdcPMfAv-UTRkQjxA. And so with my hot dog craving unsatisfied from several attempts, here I am.

Popped in towards the end of the lunch hour and was able to find a seat to drop off my backpack. At the register, I went with the eponymous Chicago Dog of course. But I knew that one hot dog wouldn't fill me up, so I had a Carolina Dog to go with it. And a Diet Coke, to cancel out all those bad calories.

The Chicago Dog was made almost perfectly traditionally. An all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with sport peppers (a little too hot for my taste, I took one bite and had to put them to the side), tomato wedges, chopped onions, yellow mustard, celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark. The only ding is that the pickle was a slice (lengthwise) rather than a spear. It doesn't matter to me personally, but a Chicago Dog connoisseur might be upset. Whatever, it tasted AWESOME.

The Carolina Dog was ON THE MONEY. Also an all-beef hot dog, it was topped chili, mustard, chopped onion, and cole slaw. Messy as all get out, but I was prepared and didn't wear any of it home.

After seeing the mentions of the fries, I skipped 'em. Free refills on the soda. If it's a nice day (and it was!) take it outside.

Oh, and that pesky craving for hot dogs? Totally slayed.),(I love Chicago hot dogs. I have loved them since I was a wee girl. Therefore, any place that makes a real deal, Vienna beef, loaded Chicago dog is aces in my book. 

Is Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. 

The Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. 

I definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future.),(I am going to keep my rating four stars simply because I love their Chicago dogs, but Matt, do not serve me limpdick french fries ever again or else.)"

I brought Mrs here for brunch on the way to food shopping and it was a hit. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived and there was a line even to give names to the hostess, but the bar had open seats and we just went over to there and ordered immediately.

She had the lemon poppy French toast and while she said the flavor was there, it was less like eggy bread and more like eggy cake. Very sweet and the berries on top were great. Especially so since they were more room temperature and not frozen like they'd just come from the cooler.

I had the florentine benedict. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and popped when cut. The muffin underneath was a little underdone but the spinach was excellent. LOVED THE HOME FRIES. The fried onion strings on top were an interesting garnish.

We also got a ""half order"" of a biscuit and sausage gravy. This was really yummy with a nice peppery gravy that had lots of sausage bits and a good fluffy biscuit underneath.

Good choice for breakfast!),(Came for brunch on a Sunday around 930am and it was perfectly open with tables available. We walked in and were seated immediately. I've been to the Ballantyne location several times and have loved it. 

Ordered the BBQ Chicken quiche for my entree and where I can say it had great flavor, it definitely lacked in structure. Think it was just a matter of being cooked long enough, but it was definitely falling apart. Also, the dressing on the salad as a little wonky. I did love that the fruit on the side had the option of being all berries. Big plus. 

The rest of the meal was stellar per usual. Killer oatmeal, hashbrowns, orange juice, and silly, tilty glasses. 

Keep it rockin', Terrace. You've got a space in my heart. Cheers.),(Yum this place is so good.  I had a chance to stop in for lunch and I was just as impressed with my lunch selection as I was when I had dinner here.   If you get a chance the roasted red pepper & gouda soup is out of this world amazing.  This place is hopping during lunch.  The food and service were both excellent.  Now I must make it back for some brunch next time.),(Yum. Quiche. Yum.

That was pretty much my conversation with myself the other day during my lunch at Terrace Cafe. And if you're wondering, yes, it was a one-way conversation. I know you're jealous of my communication skillz.

Anywho, Terrace Cafe, a cute little cafe burrowed in the Piedmont Town Center. Truthfully, when I was seated upstairs and took in their menu for a few minutes, I wasn't wowed by their lunch selections. However, my friendly waitress told me about their lunch specials, including a ""healthy"" slab of quiche baked with feta, house roasted turkey, tomatoes, spinach and onions. This $10 special was served with a substantial side of greens and a generous fresh fruit cup. 

Um, YUM. I love quiche in general, but this particular slab (not exaggerating here) was creamy, well made and finished with a tasty crust. It was quite a nice portion for a ten spot, especially for lunch. The turkey was ridiculously good and I was really impressed with the quality of the quiche. 

I'd really like to come back and give their breakfast\/brunch a shot as the red velvet waffles were taunting me.),(May I vent first thing about Piedmont Row, not Terrace Cafe?  I was all excited about trying TC, I decided to meet  one of my friends for an early lunch.   I hop on my bike, a brand new orange Electra Townie no less and park it in between Terrace Cafe and Dolcetto, two businesses that we should frequent so they can thrive.  Don't you know some man from somewhere does not like my bike locked  to a light post, rats me out to the security guard and there is a ruckus to get me to move my bike.We had already been seated and ordered and our food was on the tray on the way out of the kitchen.  I am in the restroom and  my friend sees them shaking my lock and  looking at my bike, she goes out and they tell her to park it somewhere else.  My friend said, ""our food is on the way, can't we move it in a minute?""  It had to be taken care of that instant.    What were they going to do?  Fine me?  Tow my bike?  Jeez.  I moved it, but now I think I should have protested.  WTF?  Anyway, back to the matter at hand. 

 Terrace Cafe....  When I arrive, I  order some coffee, my friend shakes her head and makes me try her coffee first.  WEAK.  Am I the only person that hates weak coffee in a breakfast establishment?  I don't want cowboy coffee, I just want some decent coffee.  So, I order a latte.  A beautiful latte comes out.  Yeah!!!

 I vacillate between breakfast and lunch, what a big decision.  Lunch wins, I decide on a half sandwich and 2 soups.  Interesting.  The concept of two soups, why make a decision, have both!!!  Boo, they were redundant.  Two broth soups.  The server said chicken noodle and vegetable.  Maybe it was my Campbell soup upbringing thinking veggie soup was tomato, my bad.   The BLT was thick sourdough bread, one slice was soggy, they were slathered in butter and then barely toasted.  Tomatoes had been in the fridge.  I think they care, but maybe just need some honest feedback.  

My server was very nice and sincere and she was appalled that they made me move my bike. Even the security guard thought the guy was crazy too.    Did I mention I had to move my bike to the back of the shops at Piedmont Row near the YMCA?  

I will go back to Terrace Cafe, they did have cocktails, so I am going back for breakfast and a bloody mary.  I will park my bike near the Y, so the uptight man can get on with his work and not be bothered with the eyesore of my Townie parked at a light post. GASP.

Follow up: went today (2oct) with another friend, we sat at the bar and ordered bloody marys and an order of onion rings.  The bloody marys were fabulous and garnished with bacon, need I say more?

Since my return, the coffee was much better!!!),(11\/15\/10

Terrace Cafe was a place I'd bookmarked weeks before my sister had mentioned hearing about its red velvet waffle from a coworker.  It sounded so delicious to her, she couldn't wait for us to try it!  Thank goodness her GPS system was cooperating that morning-- we found the parking garage easily.  Reaching the cafe proved a little bit tougher, even when I stopped to ask a security guard.  Or maybe we were just a little past the point of starving??  I really liked the entrance of the cafe, which had a nice-looking deli case full of specialty juices, pre-made salads, and dessert.  I really liked the energy here and was hoping we'd be able to sit at one of the two empty tables, but we were relegated to the back of the restaurant, where the energy was significantly muted (quite sleepy, actually), and the atmosphere there (from the large and dull wall paintings and dim lighting) made me think we were dining at a generic hotel chain restaurant after the buffet rush.  Service was very slow, as well, which I thought was odd, given that there was only one other occupied table besides ours.

After much deliberation as to what to order, we decided on the Red velvet waffle ($10), the California French toast ($10), a side of bacon ($3.50), and a side of two eggs, scrambled ($2.50).  We also ordered coffee for the table.  Mom and sister enjoyed their scrambled eggs, and we all liked the hash browns, extra-crispy on the outside by request, that I chose to accompany the waffle (options also included grits and fruit).  The bacon slices were thick-cut, wonderfully-crisped, and flavorful-- well-worth the $3.50 price tag.  Mom and I found the coffee to be very weak... Funny that sis and I were drawn to this place w\/ the promise of earth-shattering delicious red velvet waffle, which she found to be boring, and I to be too fluffy and lacking of rich, chocolatey goodness, w\/ its cream cheese drizzle proving to be too sweet to flip over this flop of a breakfast treat!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g#pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g  BUT there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the California French toast!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg#_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg  This beauty of a dish consisted of three large slices of orange-scented French toast, which were drizzled w\/ orange-infused honey and a side of wonderful cranberry butter!  I wished I'd ordered this, instead!  I wished I'd ordered anything other than that silly waffle!  But I digress... Really, the French toast is not to be missed.  I would, however, request for a crispier crust, should we ever return.),(I am going to say this up front from the start, best omelette I have ever had my life.  Tomato, spinach and turkey.  Wow, wow, wow.  The wheat toast was fresh and crisp and the fruit cup had fresh blackberries in it.  I have never seen that.

Add some unique dinnerware a friendly staff and great ambiance and you have the makings of one of the best breakfast spots in the Charlotte area.  Kudos!),(My wife and I went here during restaurant week. And we enjoyed our meal.


I'm a sucker for prime rib so I ordered that. I'm not sure if it's still on their regular menu, but it was delicious. The sides were good too!

Our server was very friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. From what I remember, the dining room could use a little reno, but it wasn't too bad. It wouldn't deter me from coming back. 

I've heard that brunch is awesome here. We've been meaning to give it a try. 

But from what I did experience at Terrace Cafe on our first visit, I would definitely like to return.),(So, it's a Saturday morning and I'm in the kitchen making over-easy eggs accompanied by toast, baby tomatoes and fresh basil and my boyfriend in the living room says, ""you're cooking? I thought we could go to brunch."" Oh... okay. I never say no to brunch so stopped in my tracks and plated the ""breakfast appetizers,"" considering it a good idea since any good breakfast place in Charlotte seems to have a 20-30 minutes wait.

I was right. We drove down to South Park and put our name in (30 minute wait, as anticipated) and decided to do a little shopping at the Container Store while we waited. We're getting pretty good at fitting errands into dining based on location. Anyway, once 25-30 minutes had gone by we headed back to Terrace, where the hostess was ready to take us to our table. Perfect timing! We were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant and ordered coffee and fresh orange juice. I had the shrimp and grits (I'm becoming quite the southerner) and we shared a side of the red velvet waffles... OMG. Both were so amazing. I'm not even a waffle person when I brunch, but these were stellar. Also, give me something cajun with a side of okra and I'm a happy girl- big fan of Terrace's shrimp and grits. I left full but surprisingly not feeling TOO full- we still had a lot of errands to run that day. Oh, Saturdays!)"

I recall diving into this uber delicious, moist and, essentially perfect, cake with delight. When I sauntered back to the kitchen I saw that this sugary concoction was from Tizzerts that memory stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to yesterday when I tasted not one, but two red velvet Tizzerts cupcakes at FABO (they sell some of Tizzerts items, but not all so please don't depend on cupcakes being present there!). Why did I ""sample"" two of them? Because they were just about perfect. Large but not giant red velvet wonders with the right amount of cream cheese frosting spread across the top. Not a crumb in these cupcakes was dry and the frosting was the most wonderful mix of cream cheese and goodness. Color me a Tizzerts convert. 

Why not a fifth star? Well, for one, I need to visit her location in the Park Road shopping center and try a few more items, plus Tizzerts treats are quite pricey. But, folks, you get what you pay for, and Tizzerts pretty much rocks the house on fancy pants cakes and cupcakes.)"

Instead of reminiscing about my childhood, let's make time to evaluate a ridiculously long list of martinis, many with inappropriate names. 

Therapy has gone through some changes over the past year or two, morphing from a small martini bar to a larger scale ""marketplace and cafe"" that still offers live music and an enormous martini menu. I have to think that they're trying to be everything to everyone at this point, as they now offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. Odd, but I won't knock it until I try it. It's been ages since I popped by Therapy for a meal, so I can only fairly evaluate their libations.

I copied their drink special from their website...here they are:

mon:  Bartender Selection $2
tues:  $2 domestics & $3 microbrews
wed:  award winning 1\/2 price martini night
thurs:  $5 house flavored margarita martinis
fri:  select 1\/2 price glasses & bottles of wine
live music, no cover
sat:  live music, no cover

I'm a fan of their half price martini Wednesdays, as they conjure up some super creative beverages. The regular martini price is $12, so for $6 you get a sizeable martini made by some talented bartenders. A few of my favorites are: You've Got Some Balls, Narcissus Nectar and the Chocolate Adonis (a dessert in a glass). I recommend getting here early if you're going to partake in the half price martinis, as it can get a bit crowded. And as Faith D. noted - they validate parking in the connecting garage, hooray!

If you've never been to a Five Guys, don't get carried away with the toppings or else your burger may become impossible to eat.

Two words: Sushi Burrito. Holy mess this thing is amazing. Spicy tuna, avocado, all of the regular sushi veg, rice, and a brilliant chipotle-honey sauce rolled up in a tortilla. Absolutely fantastic flavors. When I was in San Fran, there is a place that specializes in sushi burritos, and I wish I had a chance to try it. This totally satiated my hunger!

Cowbell is a product of the same people who brought us Mortimer's and Leroy Fox. This burger joint looks nothing like its predecessor Nix. Hip decor and tremendous 80s\/90s music videos greet you when you walk through the door. 

The most difficult challenge you may face here is narrowing down your meal choice. On the app side: I recommend the Fried Mozzarella. Make sure you add the pesto and prosciutto for a just a couple bucks more. Yes, I'm in an open relationship with fried pickles, but I've had hit or miss experiences here with them. Sometimes they are just out of this world. Other times, they are way too salty and overcooked. Proceed at your own risk.

My current burger of choice: the Bruiser. It's a blackened beef patty, onion bun, Gorgonzola, roasted mushrooms, lettuce and caramelized onions. Money.

If burgers are not your thing, Cowbell also has a fantastic grilled chicken sandwich called the Winehouse- honey wheat bun, arugula, roasted red pepper, smoked habanero jack and honey mustard.

Now I'm about to get crazy on you with what side item to pick- get a salad with the homemade poppy seed dressing. I know, I'm telling you to get a salad at a burger joint. Trust me... that dressing is beyond amazing. The sweet potato tots are great, too.

Cowbell also has a contraption that makes a giant ice ball for your cocktail... if you're into that kind of thing. It's pretty cool.

Staff is super friendly. The dining area isn't real big. There's usually a wait at peak times... but it's worth it if you have the time. If the tables are all taken... grab a spot at the bar!),(Had Cowbell today after hearing good things about it through coworkers and on Yelp.  We were a group of four with no reservations and were accommodated within 15 minutes of arrival, around 7:45pm on a weekday.

They have a vast menu full of burgers and tacos, along with a nice selection of appetizers, salads, spiked milkshakes, and desserts.

Service was quick and everyone was friendly, especially the hostess!

Sweet tea!  Oh how long it's been since I've had legitimate Southern sweet tea.  So good.

For starts, our table got the fried pickles and the ""Sinatra"".  The fried pickles came with ranch sauce and were delicious, though I feel like the pickles were a bit too thin.  The batter was good - not too thick and very crispy.  The ""Sinatra"" was a plate of glorified mozzarella sticks that were shaped like chicken fingers and graced with plenty of prosciutto and some red sauce.  These were nowhere close to frozen mozz sticks - they got a collective ""mmnm"" from the table.  I'm not a massive fan of cheese sticks, so I'll take their word for it. 

I chose to have the PM Burger medium, which came with pulled pork, fried jalapenos, onions, and beer cheese.  It's definitely a messy burger that I basically ate with a fork and knife and skipped the bun, which I wasn't too much of a fan of.  The beef patty was not as seasoned as I'd like, but the burger as a whole was decent.  It had some flavor from the pulled pork and the beer cheese, but the kick was just not enough for me.  I would have liked more jalapenos.  The sweet potato tater tots were the star of the show tonight - a little sweet from the potato and from what seemed like a sweet cinnamon dust on the outside.  The outer was crispy and the inside was the perfect texture.  I hate when tater tots aren't soft inside and this was not the case.  I would definitely recommend getting the sweet potato tots.

Decent spot for burgers in the Uptown area with a nice casual ambiance and good service.),(Last night we got take-out on our walk home. Walked in, ordered at the bar, waited for probably 15 minutes and our late dinner had arrived. The two of us split the turkey burger with an order of sweet potato tots and a side of wings. Both the burger and wings were SUPER spicy (which I love) and the tots were surprisingly sweet. If you want more of a savory side, add ketchup to the tots. Otherwise, they're delightfully cinnamon-y and make for a good dessert with your burger. 

The food did seem to take longer than expected, but at 9:30 at night hardly anyone was eating. It probably took the kitchen a few to get ready to start cooking again- who knows. Otherwise, pretty solid.),(I was staying nearby at the Marriott and saw this place on Yelp and decided to stop in for a quick lunch.  The staff was very friendly and was happy to offer suggestions from the menu.  I ended up getting a turkey burger on sourdough bread and it was very good.  They had lots of drinks to choose from, but it was the middle of the afternoon so I just had a soft drink.  I would have loved to had time to go back and have a drink though, so next time I am in town I will make sure I stop back.),(So have been in Charlotte (pretty much weekly) for about 10 months or so and Cowbell has turned into one of my consistent ""go to"" spots. It is a burger joint serving up an extensive variety of burgers and they also serve small bites, wings, and salads. This joint also serves up a good selection of whiskeys and they have what seems like an endless supply of drinks. I have been to this place over a dozen times now and it is a consistent experience that I can totally appreciate.

The restaurant itself is not large with a ""L"" Shaped bar and around 20- 25 tables. They also have live music on certain nights if that's your type of thing. The bartenders & waitresses area always friendly and accommodating and there are plenty of TVs set up for you to watch whatever sports you are into as you enjoy your meal. I have gotten plenty of different types of burgers including the umami, dumpling, Carolina but for me the one that stands out is the PM burger. I always get my burgers naked so unfortunately I wont have a ton of perspective on the bread but the meat is cooked well and the toppings are always plentiful. For the PM burger I love the jalepenos that come out with it and ALWAYS get the sweet potato tater tots .They are just delish (never soggy) and perfect in some honey mustard for me but I figure they will go well with anything.

I have been so excited for Haberdish to join the Charlotte culinary scene and it was worth the wait. Real talk: this is the only restaurant where I will ever order chicken tenders. You win #alltheawards for chicken tenders. 

Before I talk about the rest of the food, here's an important life hack for this place: get on your Yelp app and use the wait list option. Yes, you can literally put yourself on the waitlist. It's always going to be busy. Don't act surprised, don't bitch about it, just deal with it. And if you don't feel like waiting (or talking to human beings), you can get on the Haberdish website and place to go orders. 

Our visit here we got: cheese straws (the only thing we didn't love), dill house pickles (bread & butter and a daily option as available), biscuits & bacon jam (the winner of the apps), deviled eggs (a very close runner up), chicken tenders, smoked chicken (Alabama White Sauce is what made this dish), sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins, broccolini, charred okra, tots, and the waffle for dessert. Before you plan an eating intervention for me, please note that this was all split among four people. I thought everything was delicious. I love their homemade hot sauce. The table as a whole did not love the sweet potato dumplings. They are different. I liked them, though I may not order them every time because there are so many delicious side options. On Sundays, they do chicken and waffles. Tuesdays, chicken and biscuits. 

I didn't do a cocktail this visit, just a glass of rosè. Colleen was just named Charlotte's best bartender by Thrillist. I have no doubt you can't go wrong with a drink here. 

The most surprising thing for me was how affordable a meal can be. I paid for my rosè, an app, couple chicken tenders, couple sides, part of the dessert and spent less than $30 (before tip). 

If you're not familiar with NoDa, a warning that parking completely blows in this neighborhood. Be patient, drive around, pay attention to signs, and don't block anyone's driveway.),(Outstanding decor but the menu doesn't do much for me.

Drove down to NoDa from Cornelius today from brunch at Haberdish. I't gotten a lot of very good reviews across several platforms and maybe I ordered the wrong items, but it did not do much for me. More on that coming up.

Parking in NoDa is a pain but that is true for any venue in NoDa so be aware and don't let that bother you. Just be prepared to cope with it.

When you enter Haberdish, the interior is outstanding. Very light and attractive with the use of light to create a place of beauty. The bar is particularly well done and obviously, well appointed.

Service is excellent and we were immediately greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Our server was there immediately with menu and to take our beverage orders..We both ordered coffee and since she was not driving, I ordered her a drink called a Love Potion which is as close to a Bellini as I could come.

Looking over the menu created a problem for my wife. She is on a diet and trying to stay away from fried foods and carbohydrates and there was little on the menu that did not fall into one of these two categories. There was a brined smoked Chicken but the smallest portion was a half a Chicken which is a bit or a large serving.

She ended up with the Kale Salad which turned out to be excellent and the Chared Okra which was OK although the texture was a  bit different.

I order the two piece Fried Chicken all white meat along with Corn Pudding and Chared Okra as well. I know that a wing is technically white meat because of the chemical makeup but to me, I still do not consider it White Meat.  The 2 pieces of White Meat turned out to be one breast and one wing, both overcooked with little flavor outside the coating on the outside and very dry. I felt the same way as my wife about the Chared Okra.

On the other hand, the Corn Pudding was the surprise of the meal. Simply but very flavorful like my mother used to make in the Summer when the Sweet Corn came into the Garden. This was the high light of our meal.

Again. maybe I chose the wrong items because there were another of other items on the menu that looked good and I could have tried. Family at the next table had the Mac and Cheese and it looked great. Maybe I'll try that next time.),(Winner Winner 
Haberdish Dinner

I've been to Haberdish once and I fall in love right away. It really lives up to the hype, and it became one of my few favorite spots in Charlotte. If you haven't been yet, make haste! It's time to prepare your loose-fitting pants for an incredible Restaurant.

Some of Foodful info: 
- HABERDISH: Haberdashery + Dish.
- Great service (southern hospitality). Friendly and attentive waitress (shoutout to Jillian.) 
- Bright, airy space and welcoming ambiance.
- Deviled eggs, chicken tenders, mac & cheese and okra. One of the best (and interesting) brunches I've had in a while.

- Closed on Mondays. Chicken & Biscuit Night on Fridays. Chicken & Waffles all day on Sundays.
- Haberdish don't take advance reservations, however, you can see the current wait time with the ""Nowait app.""

Five Yelps),(It was really the perfect setting. A beautiful restaurant, with even the tiniest details being pretty darn adorable. Tea comes in mason jars, rose gold cutlery, and reclaimed wood everywhere. Unfortunately my dish just fell flat. 

I ordered the egg tartine. It sounded like an interesting dish, with a soft boiled egg over arugula, beet spread, pickled red onion, with a sage honey vinaigrette. I believe the main culprit was the amount of beet spread that just overwhelmed what should have been a light dish. I just couldn't get into it.

I will say the service was super friendly considering me and my coworkers parked it there for hours. I know that's not the most ideal situation for a server, so kudos to her for refilling our waters and being patient with us. I would absolutely give this place another shot, as I really feel like maybe this is one of the misses on the menu.),(I greatly enjoyed my experience at Haberdish! Five of us went in for a working brunch on Friday, and it was the perfect location for our needs. At 10am, only a few tables were occupied, so we opted to sit in the semi-outdoors patio area off the main dining room. 

Our server (I think her name was Carolina!) was beyond sweet and accommodating to our many beverage and food requests. I started with a classic bloody mary and later enjoyed a smoked mint julep, both of which I'd highly recommend. I love that the coffee is served in a thermos, which keeps it pretty hot for a while. 

We shared a few plates to start, including pickles, hushpuppies and a cinnamon roll. I can't speak to the cinnamon roll (though it looked delicious) but I can definitely say that the hushpuppies were the best I've ever had. Haberdish serves theirs with sweet tea butter, which was phenomenal, and even more so with a dash of the housemade hot sauce. 

My main plate consisted of the egg biscuit sandwich, a chicken tender, mac and cheese with spicy\/crispy chicken skins, and some kale salad. Delicious! This was the southern meal I showed up for! 

I had to practically roll myself to the airport after our brunch. I'll be eating clean all week to make amends, but it was totally worth it!)"

Our table wasn't just off balance, it totally rocked and not in a good way.  The host and servers seemed young and doe-eyed.  Our server went home and we got another one.  They never refilled our water glasses.  When they checked on us, it was kind of like an afterthought.  But let me tell you, the food is DELICIOUS!  

We all ordered small portions and shared.  We had filet, scallops, crab and lobster fritters & a chicken dish.  I even had a cheese course with tawny port for dessert, we all had a couple of glasses of wine and our bill was a little over $100 for four.

I'd probably rate today's visit 3- or 3.5 stars had my take-out order not taken more than the eight minutes I was told it would take for the wings to cook, which the guy even apologized would be the reason I'd have to wait a bit, and had I received the shrimp lo mein entree (for Mom) I'd asked for, rather than the shrimp lo mein combo that Mom found after we'd already arrived home.

Lovely restaurant owned by two sisters for the last 20-something years in the Elizabeth area.  Their menu is what adrove me to bookmark this spot and eventually try it out today, finally!  A short Uber ride later, we arrived to an almost-empty restaurant on a Tuesday evening, which eventually became more filled as the evening went on.  The crowd seemed like the business crew, since I recognized all the finance and tech speak that was going around at all the tables.

Our server was extremely friendly, patient, and helpful.  She always kept coming back to check on us - gotta love that Southern hospitality!

We started off with 3 appetizers:
- Grilled octopus - probably one of the smallest pieces of grilled octopus in the form of an appetizer I've ever seen.  However, it was of a good texture and cooked fairly well, though it could have been slightly more tender.
- Beef carpaccio - I would not recommend this if you are not a mustard fan.  It's covered in a tangy, slightly spicy mustard.  The beef itself is sliced so thin that you hardly taste anything except the mustard - probably the only downside of this dish.
- Mussels - the broth is flavorful and different from the typical white wine and garlic both and the crostini that came with it was amazing.  However, I just wasn't all that impressed by the mussels - they could have been infused with more flavor from the broth and the texture of the mussels were way softer than I am used to - they basically fell apart when I tried to take them out of the shell.
Overall, I'd have to say the apps were a 3-4 star quality in my personal opinion.

For my entree, I chose the venison, cooked medium rare and loved it.  Everything about this dish was good, from the well-seasoned, perfectly cooked venison to the very flavorful kale and pancetta.  This dish is quite a bit tangy what with the wine\/grape sauce, but I love tangy food so this was great for me.

We went a little wild on dessert and ordered three.  The toasted coconut cake with ice cream was nothing short of amazing and was my favorite item of the desserts.  It was a very moist cake with cream cheese frosting and not too sweet.  It was also HUGE.  It went very well with the spicy pineapple and cold ice cream.  YUM.  I would definitely go there and get just this again.  The creme brulee was pretty standard - it had a great vanilla bean flavor to it.  Unfortunately, I didn't try the shortbread cookie.  The mexican hot chocolate cake was just too chocolately and rich for me, and thus I did not have much.  Definitely, definitely go for the coconut cake when you're there.  5 stars for this.

Great experience here - would recommend to business travelers and tourists to CLT!),(Seize the day and get your hungry self over to Carpe Diem. While Carpe Diem is a little fancy pants to just roll into with jorts and a Dale Jr. tee, make the effort. It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing. 

I've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...

Warm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.

Cheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. 

Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops. YUM.

Desserts: They special make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious type of creme brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with their dessert selection!)"

Most of the small sandwiches you can get for around five bucks. They have a sandwich for everyone. I usually get a small #10 (turkey and cheese), all the way, add mayo and jalapenos. Sometimes I get crazy and go for the #13 (ham, salami, pepperoni). They do not skimp on the meat. The veggies and bread are always fresh.

No subtractions, no reduced portions no half-assed attempts at bringing back customers. Normal portions and great food.

Ambiance: Blue is just pretty inside. They have a lovely bar, spacious tables and an overall upscale ""chill"" atmosphere. 

Service: Our server was great. Dealing with a table of five women is probably not the easiest task of the night but he did well. He was friendly, polite and offered great suggestions.

Tega Hills Mixed Green Salad: Delicious. Organic mixed greens (according to our waiter grown in Tega Cay especially for Blue), chunks of goat cheese boursin, roasted tomatoes and a tasty vinaigrette. This was all topped with a pistachio tuile, which looked like a cookie and tasted like a crouton. 

Alaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash: I'm copying exactly what was in this dish straight from their menu ""pan-seared, potato-crusted halibut over lobster, corn, fava beans and tomatoes in a creamy lobster broth."" It was delectable, friends. The halibut was moist, perfectly encrusted and perfectly balanced with the succotash. I would have loved a bit more lobster, but who wouldn't?

Sticky Toffee Pudding w\/Salted Caramel Ice Cream: Our waiter mentioned to me that he hasn't seen anyone actually finish the ""cake"" part in this dessert. Now I know why. While the salted caramel ice cream was beautiful with the sticky toffee pudding, there just wasn't enough to go around and cut the sweetness of the cake part. The dessert was generous and tasty, but I needed more 'scream. And by the way, if they offered to sell this salted caramel ice cream, I would buy it in a heartbeat. 

*Note to Blue, your food was great but please don't tease us with a list of desserts on the Charlotte Restaurant Week website that you aren't going to serve. While the desserts were great, I and some of my fellow diners had our hearts set on a few of the desserts listed online but were not served that evening. Sad face.

Overall, this was a very, very good meal and a great deal for Restaurant Week. Adding up all of the components, this meal (post tax, pre-tip) would have normally retailed for roughly $60 and I paid $41. Would I pay retail for this full menu, sure, I probably would. I just wouldn't order all three courses in one sitting. 

See ya soon, Blue. I'll likely be the girl in the corner hoarding the chocolate martini and two desserts.),(I loved this place the first time, but I went back for Restaurant Week, and was incredibly disappointed.

Fisherman's Daughter Wild Shrimp and Cucumber Salad - NOTE: This is NOT a salad. It's 4 cocktail shrimp with sweetened tomato sauce and a shreds of cucumbers. Bleh.

Prosciutto Flat Bread - Had a really stinky fontina cheese and I felt the sage was too pungent. Also, I didn't like the quality of the flatbread.

Alaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash - Most flavorless halibut I have ever had. Lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless! I added a boatload of salt, so it was somewhat bearable. 

The Cake di Chocolate is standard lava cake (takes forever to make).
The Pecan Pie was HUGE. 
The Sticky Toffee Pudding was very butterscotchy. 

Overall? Not a fan.

Maybe if I come back next time I'll have better luck?),(Quite a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue. Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.

The staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.

It's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.

The cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.

Be sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!),(So before I headed over to the Charlotte Elite Event-Yelp's Roaring Good Time I stopped into Blue for a drink and some food as I was an hour early (happens when one lives in the city going to events in the city).

It is restaurant week so the place is packed and folks and the bar is too as folks from work are getting lubed up before heading home.

Suits and dresses abound, but I found a chair at the bar and ordered a few beers and a mix Mediterranean plate full of some small snacks to keep me from getting too lubed up myself at the Yelp event.  

They have a happy hour for food, so may sure to check out the menus on the bar.

I have yet to sit in the dining room, but hear great things about it.),(I must have been in a good mood (translated to champagne haze) as every place I went to on this snowy night in Charlotte seemed more fun than the last.  But know we only drank here and didn't eat.

Oh well- it's my review and my night and I was having a blast! We stopped in here to grab a drink (or two or three) to listen to some music after dinner at a nearby restaurant. 

We sat at the bar and immediately found ourselves in the middle of a Catholic high school reunion complete with the football jock, the crazy girls and some pretty bad chocolate cake that the bartender set down in front of us. 

Fun is where you make it- so we stayed to listen to the band play (my only wish is that the stage area had been a few steps further away) but the band was quite good and we enjoyed the range of music. The place has a contemporary feel with the restaurant on one side and the bar area over to the right. Several drinks later and it was either join into the catholic school reunion or push on to the next place. 

So push on we did- but not before thinking that this place was OK and might even be better than that on a night where squealing women were not reliving their high school fantasies!),(A friend of mine from my hometown in Michigan found out I moved to Charlotte for a bit and told me I must check out Blue- so after a month and a half here, I finally did. We made an Open Table reservation thanks to Yelp (recognizing my boyfriend under his first-name-last-name-initial Yelp alias when we arrived at the host stand) and discussed where they would seat us amongst themselves for what seemed to be a solid 5 minutes. The host finally walked us to a table, realized the table wasn't available, and walked us across the very large restaurant to a little two-top nook. Not a bad table, but it always makes me laugh when hosts\/hostesses are confused about where to take the table. I mean, I know how it is from my college days as a hostess in fine dining, having servers whine about not having equal tables and blah blah.

So we're seated and we look over the menus. It's supposedly Mediterranean but there are dishes from all over the world, with the origin of the dish and suggested wine pairing accompanying the description. We were torn between the crab\/lobster cakes and the hummus, but opted for the cakes because LOBSTER. Always go for lobster. We ordered our main courses (venison for him, scallops\/pork medallions\/pasta for me) off of the ""seasonal"" menu section... shortly after, our appetizer arrived. Absolutely delicious cakes, however there were two and very small. I suppose for something so rich you only need a bite. My pasta dish was good and not cream-based- it mostly got its flavor from  the scallops and pork. Very good, a lot of pasta which I didn't finish. We always share bits of our meals whenever we go out, though this time I didn't try the venison- maybe it's the ""I grew up in Michigan and I protest against deer hunters"" thing, maybe it's because venison is just too gamey. He liked it though.

That said, we go out several times a week and haven't been totally blown away with any Charlotte dinners until this weekend- 2\/2 nights out this weekend were solid- and I'm glad my friend recommended Blue to us. For the food, we'll definitely be back.),(Nice upscale bar & restaurant for live jazz music and food. Located within walking distance to the Epicentre. The ambience is intimate with dim lighting but love enough for groups & girls night out or a nice happy hour. There's valet parking for your convenience. Explore Blue Restaurant & Bar scene if your looking for a great music venue while enjoying dinner.

Great selection of quickly made entrees. I do not think that they pop stuff out of a microwave here at all - it's made right to order. Friendly service and so darned fast! You can see right into the small kitchen where it's all prepared.

I had the chicken curry with brown rice. Great flavor with nice, crisp veggies and plenty of them. Lots of chicken too! Clean plate! A great deal for a fresh meal for under $7 with tip.

TV's on opposite sides of the restaurant. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Try the lot across the street next to Moe's and the YMCA.),(The chicken broccoli lunch special really hit the spot. There were plenty of vegetables (just what I was looking for!) and it came with your choice of 2 side orders ($5.75 after tax). I was glad they had brown rice, but there were no other healthy side order choices. I opted for the shrimp egg roll, which tasted kinda bleachy on the inside. Stay away! Should've gotten 2 orders of brown rice because they don't give you much rice.

They carry some Thai food as well as Teppenyaki (how odd...), and for dinner they have small orders that come with rice - just $5. I wish they had soups on the menu, mapo tofu, or bbq pork (some of my favorite dishes). I'd come back anyway, plus the owner is Malaysian and very nice. Best part? They take AMEX!)"

Starting with the bruschetta as an appetizer. Really nice chopped tomatoes on the crusty bread, the drizzled balsamic was excellent. Scooped up every little bit. Five pieces is a weird number - it does not divide very well!

Then the pizzas. Veggies for me and it was well loaded up. The crust was nice and crunchy but just a little doughy. I really enjoyed it and we brought half of it home. My daughter chose the Thai Dye and substituted tofu for the chicken. It was also tasty and the cucumbers on it really gave it a nice clean flavor. Yum!

Good service and good food. A solid ""Yay! I'm a fan."" experience.),(Mellow isn't the best pizza in town, but if you're looking for some decent pizza choices in a ""sit-down"" atmosphere then you really can't go wrong. Kind of an oddball location for Ballantyne Commons, but seems to be flourishing rather well. 

This placed is slammed from being in the ""burbs."" Venture in on a Friday evening or any mealtime hour on the weekend and....well, let's just say that you'll have fun holding your pager whilst waiting for your table to clear. 

Not too impressed with their pizza. The mega veggie and white pizza are really flavorful but every time I've been, you have to ""fork and knife"" the pie. A little too flimsy to hold and very, very, very, very greasy. I can appreciate a good fork and knife pie, but typically when its going to be Chicago style. 

Great beer choices. Love that they have some great micro, craft and macro brews on draught. The bar is perfect to squeeze into if you're looking to grab a quick meal and brew with your wife, buddy or if you're flying solo. 

The place is decorated to the gills in vibrant hippy art. If you're into that....you might as well fill out an application. 

Service is always friendly and fast. Never had any problems or negative experiences in the few times I've been. 

Definitely order the pretzels (pizza dough inspired). They are TO DIE FOR. 

Also, the spinach artichoke dip is the best my wife and I have ever had. 

Caprese is always a standard choice. 

If you're headed there for pizza, you really can't go wrong with any choices. Just heed my previous comment. If you choose not to fork and knife your slice, you'll probably end up wearing it. 

Definitely worth a try if you haven't had the Mellow experience yet.),(Yums! I've been here twice now and both pizza's ordered were hot & delicious. One was the large Meat pizza which fed 4 men and myself. We also had a bruchetta appetizers and drinks which held us over otherwise I don't think it would have been enough.

I had to return my shopping cart because the first one I grabbed had a flattened wheel.

Walking in for a late dinner at 9:00 tonight, we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The waiter must be new, because he's a character. Lots of smiles and humor as he took care of us. Almost too much!

I went with the all-you-can-eat ribs ($10.99) and they were fall-off-the-bone. Nicely cooked, my first plate had four of them. Very meaty, though perhaps not as hot (temperature-wise) as I expect. I decided to have a second plate, which had three large ribs. These were just as good and were served at the right temperature. The cole slaw seemed processed and the mac & cheese was only barely warm, but the cornbread was fresh and delicious.

My eating partner had the all-you-can-eat chicken ($7.99) with a baked sweet potato and baked beans. The potato was rather small and the beans had a lot of bbq sauce mixed through. (Other available sides are green beans, baked potato, fries, and others I can't remember.)

The ribs and chicken are only barely sauced. Instead at the table are four squeeze bottles of sauces - mild, smoky, smoky sweet and spicy. They're all good, but I prefer a mustard bbq sauce.

All of the sides are also included with the all-you-can-eat as are the drinks. They have a very delicious sweet tea, fountain coke products and Bud\/Bud Light on tap.

We skipped dessert, but did bring some bbq shredded pork home, which looks great. They put in two tubs of cole slaw and good sized packets of each of the sauces.)"

And so when you're dining New York deli style, who can resist the awesomeness of a Reuben sandwich. Hot pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, tart sauerkraut and tangy Russian dressing (they also do it with mustard) on rye bread and then grilled. I might have the taste buds, but I sure don't have the metabolism and so Phil's makes a slight bow to such folks and offers a ""turkey"" Reuben sandwich. Perhaps a handful fewer calories, but that some great taste.

The drink cooler includes the usual Coke stuff, but the hidden treasure is the Dr. Brown's sodas. And my favorite, the Diet Cream which goes surprisingly well with a ""diet"" Reuben.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Israel early next year and she is paranoid that she's not going to find anything to eat. Keep telling her that everything will be fine and she is going to enjoy a new experience.

To give her a reference point, we went to Lazeez Mediterranean Grill near the University several weeks ago. Being somewhat familiar with Greek we were able to identify several items that sounded familiar.

My wife started out with Yalandji Dolma which is stuffed grape leaves with rice, tomato, onion and mint and also Baba Ghanouj which is Grilled Eggplant with Tahini etc.

I had the Lamb Kabobs and also ordered the Baba Ghanouj (GHanoush) as my  main course.

To start however, I had a complimentary bowl of Lentil Soup.

While we waited for our meal, we had occasion to observe the restaurant. Very nicely appointed with nice touches of the middle east.  TV's were tuned to Soccer.

Our server was excellent and we could not have asked for better service.

My Lentil Soup arrived first and it was delicious. Nice delicate flavor with a lot of texture to the soup as well.

Our main course came our a few minutes later. My wife liked her stuffed Grape Leaves but did not care for the Baba Ghanoush. Said it was too bitter.

My lamb kabobs were excellent. Best I have had in a long time since I went home with my Lebanese Room Mate in College.  I had never had the Baba Ghonoush before and initially I found it somewhat bitter but I ate most of it and the more I ate, the more I liked it.

Today despite the fact that I found it somewhat bitter initially, I looking forward to the next time I dine on it.  Must be an acquired taste.

Everything was very good but give my palette time to adjust and I'll probably rate it higher.)"

I had these guys on my Yelp Radar due to the respectable reviews.  As soon as I saw there was no line (YAY!) I did a U-turn to stop in and grab something for the flight home.  I wanted to get some variety so I could just eat it later if need be. 

So the story goes - - 

- Chicken & Biscuit - was pretty good, probably one of the Top 2 things I ordered here.  The biscuit kinda fell apart, the chicken was pretty good, not really crispy good as described in other reviews, but respectable.  I would get this again. 

- Potato Rounds - this was the other Top 2 item probably because it was piping hot and fresh.  Very crispy, tasted great, I'm just glad there was only 5-6 because I could easy over-consume these.  

Now it starts the decline from 4-4.5 stars to the 2 star experience: 

- Egg and Bacon Biscuit - not that great, didn't seem as fresh, the bacon was....meh.  

- Coffee - that came with my meal was lukewarm, and I asked for cream and didn't get jack squat. 

- Ham n Cheese Biscuits - they were advertising a sale on these, don't recall the price, but I got extra for later but took a quick bite to check out the quality - - yuck.  These looks like they were sitting on the warmer ten minutes too long.  The ham was solid like cardboard, the cheese.....?  Let's not go there - - these were horrid and should not have been served.  If I wasn't on my way out I would have gone back to return them and get a refund - - yeah, that bad, Bo....that bad.  

The customer service was sort of friendly, more business-like and she tried to get me out of there so there was a sense of urgency.  I could tell she was held up by something cooking - either the Chicken or the Rounds.  I was kind of in a rush so that could have caused her to forget the cream for my coffee.  

Had the rest of the sandwiches been as quality good as the Chicken and Biscuit, it would have been a stellar experience for this chain.   Unfortunately in this case, Bo doesn't know consistency.)"

Whatever. I visited Duckworth's off of Park Rd long ago for a beer with some colleagues and didn't have the pleasure of perusing their menu in full. I had been meaning to revisit and explore their array of Philly's and, boy, am I glad that I did. 

My wife and I went last night to the Ballantyne location. Went around 7:30, so it wasn't slammed. Got a nice booth all to ourselves. Big enough to stretch out and play a little bit of paper football. 

Our server, Bailey, was very bright, funny and helpful. They have TONS of beers on draught. Much to our everlasting joy, plenty of NoDa and Birdsong brews as well. Beers came out nice and cold and our appetizer shortly followed. 

Here's a tip: Get the Buffalo & Bleu Cheese Chips as an app. Awesome homemade chips with a generous helping of bleu and buffalo sauce. Not overpowering and perfect pair for a great Pale Ale from Birdsong. 

Entrees were next, of course. My wife got the Caprese Sandwich. It was delightful. Chalk full of fresh mozz, tomatoes and basil on a hoagie. The first of its kind that I've seen. Sweet potato fries to accompany. They were pretty standard with a honey mustard dip. 

I had the pleasure of experiencing the Buffalo Chicken Philly. Not an avid Philly eater, but this one was great. Finely chopped, smothered with cheese and buffalo sauce....Yeah, I was a happy camper. Delicious. The onion rings could use some work. You know, the kind where you snap a bite out of one and the whole onion comes trailing behind? Yeah...I hate being left with a deep-fried, onion-flavored tube of goodness, too. Not a deal breaker, but just an opportunity for some improvement. 

My hat's off to you, Duckworth's. You'll have us coming back on the regular for sure. Especially if you keep having CoCo Loco on draught!

Cheeers!),(This is our second time to Duckworths and really I'd give this visit 3.5 stars because the service was just sooooo slow (2\/5).  But the small supreme pizza was very good.  Again though the wait, and keep in mind that small 10 inch pizza was all we ordered but it took a good 35-40 minutes, yes,  no joke, can I getta WTF??  But the waitress was fine albeit she was not as present as we'd would have expected with drinks either.  Heck she may have forgot about us . 

Seriously,  at one point we decided to leave, which I never generally consider.  I didn't take a pic of the pizza because at that point I honestly forgot so just an interior shot.  The pizza was good though, but probably not worth the wait.  Also, it really gets loud in the restaurant and the overall layout of the tables seems random and odd (2\/5).  But we would still go back for the pizza and give them another shot with the service.),(While visiting North Carolina, I was fortunate enough to catch my friend's birthday celebration. She decided to have it at Ducksworth in Charlotte. It was a nice location for a multi-generational event. 

The vibe is like cabin casual with a full bar, big screens playing sports and several seating options. The staff seemed to be friendly and on top of things considering how busy it was on a Friday night. The noise level can be a bit loud, I'm used to it but do to the cheering of fans watching the games and the amount of customers don't be surprised if you have to SPEAK UP!

As for the food, I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken, vegetables and exotic rice. This is where my rating hits 3-star or average. The meal in my opinion was average. The ambience of the restaurant seemed more exciting than my meal. I could barely taste the chicken, which the texture was a bit dry, under the cheese. I like a bit of cheese with my chicken not a bit of chicken with my cheese, thank you. The veggies and rice were good but again, the ambience was more exciting.

I will say they made a very good Cocktail so if you are looking for a beer or drink this place is quite alright.)"

The food is still mediocre. Today, I chose the chicken quesadilla and found it bland and boring. Served with a small pot of salsa, a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole, it was only for the bottle of Cholula on the table that kept it from being tasteless.

I had a Corona with it and there is something seriously wrong with paying $6.79 for a bottle of Corona. Even at airport prices, that's simply absurd.

Service was good and I was not rushed. If you have a decent layover and a craving for bland Mexican, here's Tequileria. Though the burger joint in C is excellent and the wine place in the atrium is also excellent.),(Absolutely Vile.  Cranky service and prison quality food.

Avoid.

Some airport places are good this one should be better and it's just gross.),(While having a good bit of time for a layover, we were looking to shift it into a Latin-American gear a little early before our flight to Puerto Rico out of the Charlotte airport. 

The tables were clean, and the server was extremely pleasant and attentive, but the food was really not the bee's knees. We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla. 

They did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and\/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food).),(Tequileria in Charlotte International Airport was a lively Mexican establishment.

I had very low expectations because of the poor ratings on Yelp. 

Perhaps that is why I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy my shredded chicken nachos. Keep in mind the nachos have white cheese, not yellow cheese.

With tasteless guacamole, wimpy fish tacos and a watery gin & tonic (sorry, not a margarita gal), the $25+ bill for this sad display was laughable but perfectly typical of an overpriced, underwhelming airport meal. Throw in some gruff service and my three time request for water, and I was happy to get out of there and hop on my connecting flight back to Connecticut. 
If I have another future layover in the Charlotte airport, I'll stick to fast food. At least then I know what to expect.)"

It is inside the 277 perimeter and not far from the skyscrapers of Uptown.

In addition to a number of great local brews on tap, they have an excellent menu of bar grub that's better than most places. The burgers are top notch and even on a busy night, did not take long to appear.),(Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.

Food: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.

Bar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.

Parking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.

I love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere.),(Wow. Using the overused term ""hidden gem"" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. 

HINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. 

Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. 

Service is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school. 

If you haven't been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples.),(Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward. 

Hubs and I used to frequent this sweet little spot fairly often when we lived Uptown. It's the perfect locale for a delicious burger or even better, in my opinion, an amazing chicken pita. I've tried a handful of different things at this stop, but I always go back to the pita. Plenty of moist, well seasoned bird stuffed into a fluffy, mouth watering pita, special sauce, cheese and lettuce and tomato. If I'm feeling all healthy schmealthy I go for a side salad or fruit, but their onion rings are pretty tasty too!

The service has always been super friendly and laid back - just how I like it at this kind of joint. Next time my tummy's growling in the 4th ward I'll definitely make a trip back to Alexander Michael's!),(Al Mike's looks like a house that turned their 1st floor into a bar. The atmosphere is really chill, and they have good cheap beers on tap and serve typical bar food. There was plenty of street parking when I went. 

My fave part of Al Mikes is that it's a very non-uptowny bar in uptown, check it out!

Btw, what is with people and fried pickles?!),(From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?  What's going on in there?

Once the door is open you are hit with a wave of laughter, glasses clinking, and the sound of people talking.  I think this is going to work out just fine.

The Great:
+ The bartender\/host\/server\/manager\/busboy.  This guy was friendly, funny, and helpful.  Quick to smile and full of insight, he is awesome.
+  A great selection of local beers.
+  Cool location and extremely cozy inside.

The Average:
o  The only food we ordered was a crab soup - which was completely average.

With that said, this place would be my local watering hole if I lived in the 4th Ward.  Well done!),(Cute little spot. I live just a few blocks down the street and have never even passed this place- ""hidden gem"" seems to be the term of choice for Alexander Michael's. Not only am I in love with the little parks and the historic Fourth Ward homes, but I really adore places with character- and Alexander Michael's has just that.

Alexander Michael's is dimly lit, very old and bar-looking. We were seated right away but the restaurant soon had a big wait at the door. I can see this is a neighborhood favorite. I'm currently in the ""I dine out too much and cook huge portions \/ eat as much as I feed my boyfriend"" stage, so I opted against an appetizer and went straight for the blackened catfish. He got the crawfish burrito, which is funny because we noticed that we see cajun\/creole EVERYWHERE since our recent New Orleans trip. I swear, I didn't notice anything cajun or creole before NOLA, which is a shame because I adore it so much. Anyway, I tried the burrito (yum) and enjoyed my catfish with sautéed vegetables. I'm being healthyish, you know. I'm sure we'll take a stroll back soon.),(We had one night to go out to dinner during our recent Charlotte visit, and Al Mike's is where my friend wanted to take us.  Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.  

And now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!

I love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).

The highlights in my eyes:
*great beer selection!
*fried pickles! 
*burger
*onion rings

It was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.  

We weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.

The service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!)"

Very open and clean with a retro touch. We sat in a pink booth and I was salivating at the options. Their slogan of using fresh burgers, never frozen, reminded me of In n Out. I went for Andy's Bacon Cheeseburger and you can add a side (fries, gravy fries, chili cheese fries, onion rings, or a side salad) plus drink for just a few dollars more. I went with the chili cheese fries and soda, although I regret not trying a shake. You also have condiments to add on for free to your burger (i.e. chili, mayo, veggies, etc). 

Our food was served quickly, and one bite into that burger, and I was like WOW. It was super tasty, and I am craving one now as I think about it. The only con is the bun is soggy, would definitley help if they toasted it. Lots of flavor in this mouthful! The chili cheese fries were delicious as well, love how they use nacho cheese, and they were nice to give us a side of ranch. I was pretty hungry but even I couldn't finish all the fries.

I agree with John H, I think their cheese steaks are decent. I like to do the Big Kahuna Chicken Cheese Steak and add hot sauce to it. Let's face it, I enjoy any food covered in grilled onions and peppers, jalapenos, and hot sauce.

Other than that, it was a decent ""everything"" bagel with the right toppings.

Service was quick.

Coffee urns with several flavors. They charge the full price and really, who's sticking around for free refills?),(Back-to-back bagel disasters at Charlotte's international airport\/fast walker's paradise, avoided. 

Not to say Einstein's bagels are world class, nor are they the cheapest option ($6 for a Southwest Turkey-Sausage, and a $4 smoothie), but this particular meal fit the bill for a breakfast betwixt flights. 

The ""healthy"" egg white sandwich gets a unique kick with a salsa verde, giving a cool, herbal coat to the spiced turkey patty. More substantial than Dunk's doppelgänger, it still only registers 330 calories, so go ahead and double up on that airplane beef jerky, Slim.

I've never seen that tactic before but I guess it's good they let people know in-case they were on a short timeline. 

In just a couple minutes they were taking orders again and the people who just wanted a drink or something cold were taken care of right away. I ordered a peperoni pizza bagel with a drink.

This place is super adorable. A place to grab coffee, breakfast, lunch, have a meeting, get some work done or pick up a delicious sweet treat. There is just something so soothing about sitting down and enjoying a little pot of tea. It's my out-of-the-yoga-studio zen moment. On the flip side, their cold brew is a huge rush of caffeine that will keep you going for hours. I drink a ton of coffee, but man that cold brew makes me bounce off the walls.

Need something to take to a party? Grab a loaf of Sunflour's Rosemary Olive Oil bread, a whole pie or some cupcakes.

I have a really hard time straying away from the cheddar biscuits here. They are great plain or as a breakfast sandwich. I'm also a big fan of the fig jam and brie sandwich. Although, I'm pretty sure I would eat a piece of cardboard if it had brie on it. 

Service can be a little slow at times. I think that just goes with the laid back, casual atmosphere. The parking lot isn't huge, so you may have trouble finding a spot during lunch time at this shopping center.),(Great place. Love the atmosphere. Nice and bright (sometimes too bright). 

Not much of a coffee shop vibe going on. Definitely more of a grab and go or maybe stay and eat lunch kinda joint. 

Central coffee around the corner has more of a welcoming feeling. 

Love the baked goods though. Nice and fresh and the big windows let you see all of the happenings of the kitchen. Great for the cook\/foodie at heart. 

Gets 4 stars for the wifi. Not sure what the problem is, but it tends to boot you off after a while. Be aware of this. As my job is in social media, I need constant internet access without interruption.

One of the good or great spots in Elizabeth.),(Charlotte is finally catching up - this local & organic bakery made me feel like I was stopping in a cafe in Asheville.  Chalkboard menu tells you what ingredients are local and where they came from.  Stop in for lunch and try an amazing panini - I don't think you could go wrong with any of the sandwiches but my favorite is the salami - its spicy and cheesy and yummy.  

You have to save room for dessert after all it is a bakery...and trust me you don't want to miss out...the chocolate chip cookie was one of the best I've ever had and I am dying to go back and try a savory scone.

Let me tell you, even with a quasi ""scope"" taste in my mouth, this scone ROCKED!   Crispy flakey crust on the bottom and delicious through out...I'm a fan now!),(Oh my stars another delicious bakery! Thank goodness, because God forbid I have to travel a mile outside of Elizabeth to fetch a delicious treat. 

I was really intrigued by Sunflour as soon as I read that they were opening. It's a (pun intended) sunny bakery filled with tasty treats, coffee, a smattering of tables and smiling faces. Right now they are focusing on their baked goods, but in time expect to see them crank out artisan breads and gourmet sandwiches, too. 

On my first visit I went with a recommendation, one of their special baked goods of the day - a pumpkin whoppee pie. ZOMG. Two delicate, flavorful and delicious pumpkin cake-muffin-hybrid sandwiched with a generous layer of cream cheese frosting goodness. It was fabulous. I also enjoyed a decaf vanilla latte that was oh so frothy. Yum.

One of my favorite things about Sunflour, though, is that they focus on using local & regional ingredients. On their website, their menus and their chalkboards they tell the customers where their flour, eggs and coffee all come from. With these amazing baked goods, eager to please staff and charming nature, Sunflour may be one of my new faves in Elizabeth.),(Small local business, let's support Sunflour by eating pies! They have the cutest, little baby pies, key lime, coconut creme and CHOCOLATE!  Enough for three normal slices or one just fat party pants pie. The nice girl behind the counter took two pies in the back for us and divided them so we could each take half with a smile! Now this is service!

They also have sandwiches, cookies, savory muffins all wrapped up in a modern little dining room with friendly staff. I'm gonna rate them, three pinwheels.

I would like Sunflour to make their coffee a little stronger. Please. PIE!!!

-  The baked goods.  The croissant were amazing - flaky, buttery, decadent and delicious.  I can honestly say it was the best croissant I've had in the U.S. 
-  The staff.  Friendly and helpful.
-  POS system.  I loved getting my receipts emailed to me (great for expense reports!)

The Average:
o  The panini press sandwiches were decent, but after tasting the baked goods, why order a sandwich?
o  The coffee.  The drip coffee was good, but not astounding.  The latte was also A-OK, but the foam was a bit limp and the coffee tasted a touch burned.  With that said, it was completely satisfying.

Overall a solid 4 stars and I look forward to visiting again!),(Beautiful, bright space to study, eat pastries or drink coffee with nice decor and a lovely bakery case. 

The coffee is delicious, strong and cheap. It's customizable with an assortment of sugars and milks, which I always greatly appreciate. We came for brunch, so I ordered a #2 on rosemary, and BF ordered a #5 on a cheddar biscuit. I expected it to come out panini pressed, which it did not, but the bread was still so delicious that I excused that. What I was disappointed in was the egg. It's not sunny side up or poached, but a square block of scrambled eggs, to which case mine were cold! Womp womp. 

I would easily return for coffee and a sweet treat, but probably skip the breakfast sandwich next time!)"

I'm a HUGE sushi fan and am rarely disappointed with the fare just about anywhere. Guess we caught these guys on an off day...

We made it in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. They open at 12:30pm for lunch on Sundays, so a little later than usual for some. We were one of the first couples to make it in and there were only a few warm bodies working the kitchen. The hostess, whom decided that nonverbal communication would suffice, sat us and then stormed away. I'm not too picky with hostesses, but she didn't event greet us? A simple hello and feigned smile would be acceptable. Not the end of the world. 

Once seated, our server was quick and gave us menus, filled drinks and took our order. Started with tempura veggies and shrimp. All came out very swiftly and were tasty. The soy\/hoisin sauce was delightful. 

Here's were the meal went downhill....Other couples and families started to file in and took up about 8 tables inside and outside. There was only ONE server and the manager. This is a bit unacceptable if you're opening for a 12:30pm lunch. I would understand if it were an earlier lunch, but you should expect a lunch rush....around lunchtime. Just a bit odd. 

Our drinks remained empty for a good 10 minutes and our sushi took more than 25 minutes to land on our table. I actually watched my sushi plate sit on the counter for a a good 10 minutes before our server picked it up. Once my sushi order was delivered, our server came back and asked if we needed anything...He had completely forgot to enter my wife's sushi order. Not the end of the world, but if the sushi order sheet has two sides, you just have to check both sides. It took an extra 10 minutes for my wife's sushi to arrive. All of the sushi was flavorful and well executed. Just a little put off by the service. 

I would definitely give 18 Asian another chance. These are just a few problems that can be easily fixed. As a huge sushi fan, and these guys delivered on the flavor front, I look forward to a more memorable visit in the future!),(First time and we enjoyed.

Another great restaurant by Mr. Mike Libretto. Spoiler alert: he's a hell of a great guy, too!),(I'm a big of Libretto's and have enjoyed the other two locations in town for some time. Happy to say that the newest location (here) has easily topped my list for a number of reasons. 

First, the menu is easy. Family recipes that aren't overly presented, spiced, salted, or done with too much fluff. I'm not the biggest Italian fan in the world, but when I do go for Italian, I tend to gravitate to the more puristic menu items. Libretto's recipes are made with love and it's pretty easy to tell. Recently tried the traditional spinach pie calzone and the veggie pinwheel. Both are served with a small side of perky marinara and aren't of ungodly, gargantuan proportion. I appreciate the size to price ratio.

The kicker for this location is easily the bar\/patio area(s). HUGE patio that wraps around the corner, front patio with some umbrellas over 4-tops, and giant garage doors that open to the bar. We sat on the patio around 12:30pm and it was perfectly shaded, breezy, and comfortable. How can you sit on that patio and not knock back a beer or six? Also, check out the mural at the end of the bar on the far wall. Gives it a really cool Brooklyn vibe. 

Props to Libretto's on this new location. Looking forward to more patio time really soon. 

Cheers.),(I had been to the librettos in epicentre a couple of times, but not recently. But a buddy of mine and I have been heavily craving some good pizza so we decided to get a large pie for carry out. We called ahead, placed our order and were told to come by in 15 minutes. (They're going to start delivery for their Woodlawn location very soon. A week or so, she said). Anyways, we arrived in about 10 minutes and our pizza was ready! Piping hot and smelling all kinds of amazing. 

We brought it back to the apartment and it did not disappoint. The flavor was excellent, the cheese, crust, all of that. Terrific. Definitely coming back again. Hopefully can avoid the drive and have it delivered. 

What I liked: the pizza was ready faster than expected, it tasted great, the person who took my order and helped in person was very friendly, reasonably priced, and  it's open late, AND the sell pizza by the slice, too.

I got something with chicken and then it had various vegetables and a sauce and some feta cheese. Delicious and filling. And yes, I had lots of spinach still stuck in my teeth. lol

Don't worry if there's a queue. Just after I dug into my pita, a dozen construction workers in fluorescent vests poured in followed by an ambulance crew. The two ladies behind the counter had them eating within five minutes.

Hint for folks who work such places... when someone asks, ""What's good?"" your answer shouldn't be ""Everything."" Try ""I really like the such-and-such."" I'm sure *everything* is good but I need a bit of a hint when the menu board offers this many choices.

Note: Despite the address, Pita Pit is actually on College.),(The people who work the late shift here deserve a medal. Or holiday. Or the biggest hug ever. Seriously, how would you feel if you were at work and an army of blackout drunk people stormed into your office? They deal with it every Friday and Saturday night.

I'll be honest... I'm usually not sober when I end up here. I'll make fun of the other drunk people and act like I'm completely fine. I dunno if anyone buys it.

My go-to order is the buffalo chicken loaded with some type of combination of mushrooms, jalapenos, banana peppers, insert whatever veggie I'm feeling and a bunch of tzatziki. 

I usually take it to go so I can eat it at home in pajamas. However, if you can snag a seat sit and stay for the show of the endless parade of the inebriated.

I have to give props to the workers here. They handle it all in stride and are pretty good sports about everything. Don't be discouraged by a long line. Pita Pit can pump orders pretty quickly so they wait is never all that long. If you want to avoid the madness, make sure you get here before 2am to get there before the rush.),(Seriously. How could you not like a pita crammed full of veggies, falafel, hummus, tzatziki, and hot sauce? I used to frequent Pita Pit in FL and this one carries forth the glory of pita greatness. 

I always order something different. Falafel, chicken, steak, just straight veggies...it's always good. I love that they cram as much as you want into those poor pitas. Who cares, though. The more everything drips and falls out of your pita, the more enjoyable it is! Maybe sit and eat it though...Not exactly street food if half of it falls out onto the street. 

Pretty cheap, too. We always eat with drinks and a bag of chips for around $15. Also, these dudes are open super late. Great when you're in Uptown after everything else has closed on a Monday night. 

The only downside of this location is the parking situation. Shocking. Uptown is always a pain to navigate if you're in or on any sort of motorized vehicle. We usually park at 7th street and make it a quick trip to go.),(Healthy, tasty food??

To bad I can fill one of these babies to the size of a chipotle burrito full of free toppings. Nom. And then eat 2 of them.

$2 to deliver, get it!)"

Just the kind of pizza I like huge, greasy, cheesy, delicious.  Also had a side salad to justify that huge piece of pizza I was about to devour...everything was fresh the guys behind the counter were friendly  - and it was a great place overall for a cheap lunch.

Little did she know how massive the 20"" pie was in real life...

Holy pizza pie! Now, I'm a big proponent of pizza leftovers but this was bordering on ridiculous. But I liked it. We ordered a 20"" pie with cheese, fresh tomatoes and green peppers. This mammoth only cost us about $17-$18 with tax! The most hilarious thing is that this gargantuan pie was cut into only 8 slices. Hahahah! Slices larger than my head!

I got through a slice and a half and I was well on my way to a 'za coma. The pizza was cheesy, not too floppy with a substantial crispy crust. This thin crust giant will most certainly be dined upon for the next few days. Naturally, I will absolutely be back for another huge pie in the semi-near future. Compared to the pizza chains, Luigi's is a slam dunk in size, quality and overall affordability. Plus, it only took them 15 minutes to whip up our take out order! 

My recommendation? Fold your slices, people, fold 'em and stuff 'em.)"

Pros:
-Great location that's so close to Symphony Park and SouthPark.
-Clean, spacious room with comfy beds.
-Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries (free smells!)
-Fairly quiet hotel 
-Free, stable internet 

Cons:
-The hotel is much bigger and wind-y than it appears. My room was on the hella opposite side of the hotel. Even with parking near the back we still had a hefty walk to our room.
-Slowest elevators ever. Get walkin'.
-There is often only one staffer at the front desk, so if you need help of any kind, prepare to wait awhile or go get whatever you need, yourself.

Overall, this DoubleTree is pretty solid with a great location.),(Let me start off with all the good things about this hotel. The room was spacious. living room, kitchenette with bar and microwave. Bedroom and bath. The balcony overlooked the pool. Everything was spotless and in it's place. The breakfast was served just off of the bar and it had a cold side, which came with the room. The hot side of the buffet was an extra $3 dollars? Why bother. The place was pretty big, as our room was, (no kidding) a block from the elevator! When we went to our room with our luggage. There was a tray at someone's door. It stayed there for more than 24 hours! We had housekeeping come to replace a burnt out bulb and he had to pass it twice as he had to come back. It was still there after out room was looked at the next day. When I say looked at. We had the door open and pollen was all over the carpet. Still there. The bed was made, but they left us only one towel and no toiletries. We didn't steel the one's that were there. But we had taken two showers each and there was no more shampoo. I called house keeping for more towels and I had to leave a message. When we came back I called the front desk and they were more than happy to bring some up. Now the pool was gorgeous. When I saw it. I jumped into my suit and ran the block and half to get there. Until I realized it was 40 degrees in the water and 80 outside. So much for that. The property couldn't be in a better local. Next to two great malls and you have the pavilion next door. I would definitely come back here as you get a lot for your money.

This ended up being the perfect place to take my family from out of town on Sat. night. From the moment I made a reservation till the check came the service was excellent. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was my entree was a little bland I was hoping for a little more - but you know I didn't listen to the waitresses suggestions so maybe that was my bad. 

The menu is filled with fresh fish, and steak options. I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers the calamari was some of the best I've ever had prepared Asian style with peanut sauce and wasabi I could have devoured the whole dish myself...next was the smoked salmon carpaccio I have been thinking about this dish ever since I left. Next time I just might eat the carpaccio as my meal. 

My dad and sister had the lamb and they raved about it and my little sister ordered the Mahi Mahi there was nothing left on her plate and they do serve you a decent size plate here folks. The trout dish my step-mom and I ordered was a little disappointing needed some sauce or seasoning. I will definitely be back the atmosphere the staff and the food were all top notch. Really sad I didn't save room for dessert next time for sure.),(Oh wow oh wow. I'm a big fan of Charlotte local eateries, but Dressler's takes the cake...the CHEESECAKE. 

For days, I've been talking about Jon Dressler's mama's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. OMG it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. But I won't get ahead of myself, let's go through the digs and the meal first. 

This new location is nestled into the upscale Midtown shopping center and is easy to find and to park. Inside, it's a nicely styled upscale restaurant, complete with comfy booths and a decent sized bar. There is also a nice patio, but it was hella hot, so we chose to dine indoors. 

Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, offering suggestions and personal feedback on potential menu choice for all parties. I ordered the Tuna Seared to Perfection - a sizeable piece of sashimi grade tuna, you know it, seared to perfection over a tasty rice cake. The best part was, however, the insanely delicious peanut sauce that was drizzled over the tuna and the plate. It was just enough not to overpower the item. 

Price wise, it's comparable to other upscale eateries, expect to pay roughly $20-$30 ish per entree, but it is worth it. Completely. All six of us ordered different menu items and adored them. Make sure you hear about the specials too, they sounded great. 

And back to the cheesecake...it was peanut buttery goodness in one little slice of heaven. Creamy cheesecake with the right amount of peanut butter and the perfect number of chocolate chips, all set on the most delicious chocolate crust. They should seriously make it a menu item, as it was a dessert special the night I went. Jon Dressler made a call to his mother as we were making our way out, and let my mom and I pay compliments to her dessert handiwork. Not only was she extremely humble, but she was just as sweet as her creations. 

I can't wait to go back to Dressler's for the fantastic food, great service, and, of course, the peanut butter cheesecake.),(I've been here for Yelp events, drinks, and dinner all of which were great.  I enjoy this location as well as the one up at the Lake.

Mortimer's is a great place to grab some drinks and a bite before a movie or event close by.  They have a few tables you can grab to sit on the patio outside where you will enjoy some great people watching.  The bartenders are always friendly and you never have to wait an hour to grab a drink like some of the other bars at the Epicenter.  The crowd is diverse between the young,  the old, and the in between.    The food is what you would expect from a bar nothing to brag about but decent and the drink prices are just right!),(Lunchity lunch lunch in Uptown...Mortimer's most certainly fits the bill for a super tasty lunch. So, that being said, this review focuses on Mortimer's as a day time eating and drinking establishment, not a late night stop (although I'm sure that would be delightful, too - I just haven't experience it as of yet). So, yes, 4+ stars for a low key and affordable lunch in Uptown. Here's why...

I've been in a few times, but recently Mortimer's changed their menu and now offers a variety of sandwiches, paninis, salads, starters and sides. Prices are right on the money - expect to pay $7-$10 for a sammie plus a side. It's important to note that many of the items here are made in house, like their tasty, light and flavorful chicken salad. No heavy doses of mayo mixed in with that bird salad. Hooray! Oh and I must mention the service. Every single server has been on the money here - friendly, chatty and helpful. 

I've tried the Big Easy wrap which is slammin' with a kick. But, my favorite thus far was had yesterday when I bellied up at the bar for a panini - I chose Jess' Sausalito Turkey. De-freakin'-licious. Picture manageable ciabatta with melty cheese, thin slices of spiced turkey, paper thin shards of green pepper and red onion with some delectable sauce. It was seriously good. Side wise, I've only had fruit...even thought I've coveted the macaroni salad. Next time, Mortimer's, next time indeed.),(So it was time for a drink downtown and Mortimer's came to mind.

The place was packed and not enough bar seats.  The bartender ( I wanna say Summer, but I cannot remember) whatever her name was, she was great...attentive...a little sassy.

I asked for an IPA, which they had in a bottle (I'm not a fan of draft).

A few drinks and this is still one of the best bars in the city.),(It's loud in here. Loud. Did I mention it's loud? 'Cause it's loud. Now, I admit I may be gauging this on the idea that I hit this place on the equivalent of Super Bowl Sunday around here: race weekend in the Epicentre? Locals would know better, I didn't. But at the very least, I can say I ventured into the belly of the beast for what turned out to be a couple of beers and a BLT.

I've since come to understand a couple of what appear to be semi-universal CLT truisms: if it's race week here, expect things to be crowded and loud. And if you're in the Epicentre on race week, expect to be in the middle of loads of corresponding activity. That said, the arrangement here is fine: lots of wrap-around bar, cafe tables and a small outside patio area (so as to take in the festivities). They're doing things by-the-book with the flat screens and some unchallenging menu items, and my guess is that the regulars who stop in are looking for something a little predictable. And predictable would have been fine. If standard was more along the lines of what I was craving.)"

It's a hint towards great NY pizza, or perhaps another style of NY Pizza that I've yet to experience. Regardless, I'm a fan.

Can't comment on dining at their home base on South Blvd, but the delivery, as was the product, was fan-freaking-tastic. 

Simple ordering. They deliver in a 5-mile radius from the shop. We're just in at 4.7mi. Score! 

We were quoted about an hour due to the weather and every other soul in Crown Town ordering pizza at that exact moment. However, our delivery guy showed up in about 40 minutes. Bless his heart, man. He was a trooper. Super nice guy, too.

Went with the 18"" (more like 18') white pizza -- add spinach AND tomatoes. You apparently get either\/or. Also scored a slice of their stuffed pizza. First, the stuffed slice. Stuff is awesome. Manageable to pick up and eat like a normal slice, but fork and knife made it easier for dunking into the marinara. The marinara was a little watery for my liking, but not a deal-breaker. I inhaled it. Not just because it was the only thing I had eaten all day, either. 

The white pizza. Goodness gracious, it didn't even fit in the box! It was massive. Each of us ate one slice and called it quits. Had we some friends over it would have been gone, no doubt. Good luck tackling this monster with just two. The flavors were great. A little overzealous with the ricotta, but the garlic flavor was nice. I'd order it again, but not in the 18"" variety. 

I'm a fan. I'd definitely count on these guys for trusty delivery yet again, but look forward to dining in house with a nice, foldable slice of cheese or pepperoni!),(I am a New Yorker orginally and a pizza snob and I am sorry this is not the BEST in Charlotte.   Although it is very very good it is still missing what Tony's in Ballantyne has perfected...crispy crust.  Your pizza needs to crunch!

Fries? Excellent and fresh, the right salt. Cole slaw? Good and creamy. Cornbread muffin? Firm and tasty, very good. As for the sandwich, it was quite tasty and I'd absolutely have it again. The chicken was moist and there was enough of it. Several table sauces to choose from if you want to add. The Buffalo was too hot for me but the Hubee D's was perfect.

Terrific service from an attentive and friendly waiter. I took my mom here and she had the Greek salad as her main and the flan for dessert. When the waiter started listing the specials, I stopped him after the first one - a seafood pasta with shrimp, scallops and a white wine sauce. It sounded excellent and it was very delicious. He had to bring us two more baskets of bread so that I could soak up all of that great sauce!

I had no idea there was Greek beer but I had one here - something called Mythos in a bottle that tasted like Heineken. It was great with the pasta.

Parking at Greek Isles isn't usually a problem. They have a private reserved lot that is just across the street. Or take the Lynx to the Bland station.

One warning. What meal wouldn't be complete without something bursting into flame right behind your head? They serve some sort of special meal that gets a shot of liquor at the table for that special event. Opa!),(Finally had a chance to get back to Greek Isles after a few years. I don't typically find myself in the area for dinner but an early dinner was beckoning and Greek food was just the ticket! 

Thrilled with the seating in this place. Let's just say there will never be a shortage. Huge bar area, booths, and other squaretops in the dining area. Rather high ceilings, too. Not a huge fan of all of the kitschy decor, but hey, it does add to the experience. One thing's for sure -- the food don't lie. 

We started with the hummus and htipiti (which I failed at pronouncing first time 'round) and were thrilled with both. The hummus -- smooth, mild, and served with seasoned pita. I really hope they are making that pita in house. It is some of the best I've had. The chew mixed with the toasted flavor was magic. The htpiti was equally wonderful. Blended hot peppers and feta. Might as well be a bull's eye. It housed just the right amount of kick. Both were so good we ended up eating the garnish lettuce that was served on each plate....since each had hummus\/htpiti on it. Ravenous much? 

For entree choice, we split the Santorini. Fettuccine-style pasta, tomatoes, caprese, shrimp (on the side for me), olives, and fresh herbs. It was hearty, strong in flavor, and pretty concentrated. Splitting it between the two of us was definitely the right call as it was so rich and filling. Paired with the bread they serve pre-meal, it was sang the right tune for dinner. Also, don't miss the butter served with the bread. Has a great mixture of sweet\/garlic notes in it. Wonderful. 

For the price (less than $30 for the two of us) and amount of flavor, Greek Isles is a win in my book. I hope to find myself in Southend for dinner more often. Looking forward to checking out lunch soon, too.),(Confession - I have lived just a few blocks away from Greek Isles for the past 2.5 years and I *finally* had a meal here. Why did I wait so long? I have NO idea, because the food was delicious & the service was top notch.

Hubs & I rolled in here on a random weekday evening and, I have to say right upfront, our sever Alan was just delightful. Seriously - one of the best servers I've have in Charlotte. Polite, helpful, funny & efficient. Awwwesome.

Greek Isles, inside, looks very Greek. Dur. Lots of Parthenon references, mini Greek sculptures & frescoes, and a trellis with grape leaves twisting about.  The menu is pretty standard, upscale-ish Greek with tasty standards like Gyros, Saganaki, Baklava, Spanakopita, Moussaka, etc. Price wise expect pita sandwiches in the $8-$10 range and dinner entrees from $12-$18. And, on Wednesdays, they offer a select menu of half priced bottles of wine (you can cork it and take it home if you don't finish it) - sweet! 

Here's what I ordered:

Saganaki: 4.5\/5: Flaming cheese, my friend, Flaming cheese. Delightful, just delightful. Tasty, flavorful and cheesy. Get it, now. 

Gyro pita: 4\/5: Classic gyro done right. A nice portion of gyro meat (lamb\/beef combo, I believe) well spiced and stuffed into a toasty pita with your toppings nestled around it. Onion, tomato, and perfect tzatziki sauce. 

Galaktoboureko: 2\/5: Dessert time - I think I just choose poorly. This lemon custard & filo dough combination looked delectable on the food cart, but it fell way short for me. The hefty slice sits atop a bed of honey which only contributed to the overly sweet taste. Plus, I wasn't a fan of the custard texture...I expected smooth custard, and this one was a bit grainy. 

Regardless of my dessert experience, I loved the rest of my meal at Greek Isles & it won't be long until I head back there!),(Definitely not the best chicken or lamb gyros that I've had, but I was craving it badly. 

Service is great!),(So after a LONG time looking at reviews of this place and hearing the great things and see the number of Stars, I along with a few other Yelpers checked it out.

It was dinner, though early in the evening so the place was busy, but not crowded and the bar was dead.

A spacious place with plenty of seating, it has a nice feel to it.  The bartender was very gracioius with my GF as she tried several Greek white wines, none of which she liked, so she just deferred to beer instead.  I tried a Greek beer and stuck with it the rest of the night as it was very good.

Food was of course started with the famous ""Flaming Cheese"" which my GF was skeptical about but came around once she tried it.

I went onto a Gyro as I love that sandwich, but not all the meat was juicy, rather some pieces were just down right dry and tough, but all and all I was happy with the meal and service.

While the staff was friendly and the sandwiches were excellent, by the time I had driven them five minutes to get home, they had become a little soggy. I'm sure that it is the steamer that does it. No biggie - have it ""eat in"" rather than ""to go.""

My coworker and I walked in on a Friday night and found the place crowded, but still with plenty of tables to accommodate the many parties that were waiting to be seated. Our waitress for the night was Ketty who has to be one of the nicest waitresses we have ever met. She was so meticulous when it came to explaining the menu, especially when we had some questions about the items. She came by often to check on us, always polite and always asking us if we needed anything. At one point, my coworker had a question about what vegetable his soup was made out of and she quickly went into the kitchen to ask the chef before coming out and explaining to us what it was. Just Ketty's service alone deserves five stars.

But I'm happy to report that the food at Le Kebab Grill is worth boasting about as well. Before we had even got a chance to order food, Ketty brought out a complimentary platter of two falafels, hummus, pita bread, and house chips. There was so much food! Even though there was plenty to have as a starter, my coworker and I also got the combination platter with falafels (so good we had to order more), labaneh (a yogurt cheese to eat with pita bread), and stuffed grape leaves. The yalanji was super light to have and definitely helped us meet our daily vegetables serving for the day. The labaneh complimented the hummus well, especially with the soft pita bread.

Even though I was already quite full, I still ordered the gyro plate that consisted of thinly sliced and grilled lamb and beef with a side of tzatziki sauce as well as a side of lentil soup. The lamb and beef were combined into lightly grilled slices of meat that reminded me a lot of bacon without all the fat. I loved eating it with the pita bread and the tzatziki sauce that added a touch of tang and creaminess. 

As for the soup, I've never had lentil soup before so I didn't really know what to expect. I wasn't too fond of the puree-like texture and there was a slight bitter aftertaste. However, I could definitely taste the fresh ingredients and the soup was delightfully light.

Good food and phenomenal service from Ketty easily made Le Kebab Grill one of the most memorable spots for dinner for my stay here in North Carolina. The food was flavorful, the portions were gigantic, and the service was absolutely welcoming.

There's a rhythm to the store - watching the staffers restocking at different hours, observing them taking down the salad bar, putting out the free tastes, and the smiling faces at the seafood counter.

The wine and beer section of this store is more than twice the size of any other with an amazing selection of imports and domestic choices from all around the world.

Don't miss out on the sub station for lunch or grab some fresh made sushi to go. It's made fresh on site so it's still pretty good quality. Don't miss the ""HT Trader"" generic products with a slightly lower price, there's no reduction of taste or freshness.

I've been here several times and it's always nice and reliable. Nothing I've had has ever been too heavy, greasy or inherently ""heavy."" I've had a few meat and veggie options. I've never been displeased with any! The club, grilled chicken and gyro are all great choices. 

I'm happy to say that the falafel is by far my favorite. Nice crispy orbs of falafel can be on my pita any day. They do a good job of cooking everything on the flat top grill. 

The pitas are nice and thin and, much like other places, you can have them fill it to the rafters with veggies, tzatziki, hummus, sauces and your choice of protein. 

They do these odd flat pitas that are supposed to be ""pizza-like."" Not sure that I'd ever venture down that road, but could be good for the kiddos.

Okay, so not every time. I love a good steak, but for some reason the chili glazed goodness was calling my name last week. A group of six friends came here to celebrate a birthday. Before I get to the food, I have to talk about the special touches they did for the birthday. They made us personalized menus that said Happy Birthday Jason at the top. Our server also took a group pic of the table and made a special card with it. Great stuff. 

And now to the feast. We ordered for the table jumbo shrimp Alexander and from the specials menu: crab stuffed mushrooms and bacon steak. How could we not order something called bacon steak?! Spoiler alert: worth every calorie. We also got some lobster bisque and wedge salads. The wedge was massive. The clear steak winner for the table was the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye. I wanted it, but knew there was no way possible I could finish it. Andrea and Jason split one. Great idea and I highly recommend. Back to my salmon, I thought it was delicious. The succotash type goodness under it was also really good. We ordered a bunch of sides to split. My winner was the horseradish mashed potatoes. Warning: they pack a punch. I also got a boozy coffee drink for my post-dinner dessert. It was good, but I was way too full by that point to completely enjoy it.

Filet mignon: Durr. Delicious. Perfectly cooked. Always.

Any type of potato: Really, any kind. I have yet to find a tater that I don't love here.

Morton's coffee: A delicious, alcoholic concoction that is just damn delightful. It's $8 but they also put real whipped cream on top...it's like a lovely dessert in a cup.

Lava cake: The best chocolate lava cake in Charlotte. Sorry. It is. Large, chocolatey & gooey with a honking scoop of vanilla and a smattering of fresh raspberries. I can't even finish it.

Several nice specials but we opted to order directly off of the menu.  My wife could not resist the urge to go with the Pecan Cinnamon Coffeecake with a bowl of fruit as a side. She must have liked it because there there was not one crumb left.

I opted for the Tripledecker Club Sandwich with fries as a side. Both were delicious although I can't remember having a Club Sandwich before with fresh cucumber.

I've made the mistake of trying to fight for a parking space in the lot outside. You may find yourself up against a few soccer-mom buses. Savvy? 

Either way, once you find yourself inside of Deejai's dimly lit and relaxed dining room, it's all downhill (in the best freaking way possible).

Staff is always very welcoming and quick to seat you. There is lovely seating along the side of the building and great on temperate evenings. Candle-lit dinner seekers, this is your area. Very romantic and sometimes rather quiet despite resting so close to Providence Rd. 

Here's my recommendation: 

Basil Rolls. Filled with basil and shrimp and accompanied with a light and perky plum dipping sauce. I'd drink the stuff if I could....that may be a little audacious, but it is really good. You get two with each order so maybe ordering a few plates for your table is in order. You won't regret it. 

Pad Thai. Bet you didn't see that one coming. I've always loved it at Deejai. Sweet and balanced with sour from lime wedges. Tender rice noodles and filled with veggies and tofu. You can get tons of other proteins in your order. Duck, though pricey, is definitely worth the venture. 

Curry Fried Rice. So filling. Generous portion of rice and vegetables. Wonderful yellow curry flavor and the eggs are a wonderful addition. 

DESSERT. This is the coup de grace on your appetite. Ready? 
Mango with Sticky Rice and Ice Cream. I died and went to dessert heaven the first time I had this. Sweet, hot, cold, chewy, creamy, melty, fruity heaven. This is the perfect balance of textures, temperatures and flavors for a dessert. I'm not typically a dessert person, but this beats the pants off anything else I would choose to end my meal. Well done, Deejai. I'm a believer. 

Deejai has an expansive menu with wok options and sushi. I've yet to try these but plan to in the near future. 

Price point is rather fair. My wife and I can eat here for about $30 (including dessert but not drinks). 

If Thai is what you're seeking, Deejai needs to be on your list. 

Cheers!),(By far the best Thai food I have had in Charlotte...I eat here for lunch at least once a week or more. The prices are unbeatable for the amount of food and everything is made to order no frozen vegetables here. 

You can get a lunch here dining in for under $8 and they bring you free soup and a free taste of an appetizer. They switch it up all the time and I love that I get to keep trying new items. 

I haven't been out to eat here for dinner yet but I never stop craving the food. Spicy and delicious. For something light try their Thai beef salad. My absolute favorite dish is the pork pad prik...the menu items all list suggestions of what type of meat to try with each dish, but of course you are free to order whatever you would like ... and you can't go wrong with any of the curries either.),(I've been interested in popping by this cute little Thai restaurant in Myers Park for some time now, so I was delighted when husband was in the mood for Thai takeout. This review is solely based on a takeout order, as we didn't have time to eat in!

We brought home the Basil Rolls, the Pad Thai (price level hot) and the Pad Prik (spice level medium). First off, the Basil Rolls were delicious! Hubs and I tore into those immediately when we came home. They consisted of fresh shrimp, sweet basil and bean sprouts wrapped in rice paper and came with a plum sauce for dipping. They were super light and very tasty. For $4, that's a nice deal. Two orders of these would be great for a healthy lunch!

My meal was the (spicy) Pad Thai. I decided to take a walk on the wild side and order it at this spice level as some of the reviews mentioned that Deejai's regular Pad Thai can be lacking in the spice department. Holy hot. It was tasty, but super spicy. Durr. 

The flavors of their Pad Thai were good, but not great. The peanut sauce was a little too thick for my liking and some of the noodles stuck together a bit. I prefer a lighter Pad Thai. I will say, though, this Chicken Pad Thai only cost $10 and left me enough for another (quite large) meal. 

While Deejai is not my favorite Thai place in Charlotte, it's fast, friendly and tasty!),(Thank you yelpers again for leading me in the right direction! Tom Ka soup was good not great, not enough heat and coconut flavor. The Basil Chicken was Amazing! Fantastic. The Shrimp Fried Rice was Excellent a bunch of plump Juciy perfectly cooked Shrimp! Great and Friendly Service! The bathrooms were very, very clean, this is a good sign of the kitchen as well. Keep up the great work!),(OK, a few of my foodie friends are obsessed with Deejai and I just didn't get it, well I got it today at lunch. YUMMMMMM. We ordered a lemongrass, ginger beef, green curry chicken, and a spicy ground chicken dish. Of course, I ordered my green curry spicy, it did have a kick but it wasn't as hot as the other dishes on the table. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. A little one star addition for this cute, modern establishment. 

Deejai also offers a private dining room downstairs that can accommodate up to twenty people and outdoor seating. It's on my radar now.),(Gotta love Thai food. 

Went to Deejai a few months back with the wife. It was our first time and we enjoyed it. Back in VA, my parents are big fans of Thai food so needless to say we kind of overdid it. But once the Thai craving presented itself we had to give Deejai a shot. 

The atmosphere is nice and I recall it being pretty crowded on that random weeknight that we went. The service was very warm and attentive too. There wasn't a wait, but it was very lively on that particular weeknight, but the service was still great.

Now onto the food. one word: delicious. I had the Tom Yum soup, we split some spring rolls, and my entree was the Pad Takrai, a delicious, spicy beef dish. I love spicy and it was terrific. 

You have to give Deejai a shot if you're a fan of Thai food. They have sushi too, but I didn't try it so I can't comment. But it's really good food and great prices and attentive service. 

A+),(Service here... 
Is top notch!   Wait staff is friendly, helpful and service and facilities and presentation is quite nice too.

Drinks!  
Good bar, we tried and now LOVE a fantastic Chinese beer, Tsing Tao Beer. It has a crisp finish and is very refreshing.  IMO, the ice tea should be skipped in lieu of something bottled.  My companion liked his Pinot Grigio.  

Food:
I was torn with the rating, because I simply didn't enjoy the food.  I ordered the Deejai Gai Krob which is very similar to Sesame Chicken. The waiter warned that it was sweet, but it tasted exactly like chicken stewed in ketchup, SALT, sugar, and barbeque sauce.  The three spears of broccoli, carrots and baby corn were served iced cold and completely flavorless with rubbery grains of white long rice.  My companion ordered the Green Curry which was really, really spicy and prepared with a strong coconut flavor.  He really enjoyed it.  

I have two issues with the way the restaurant is run, here they are:
        There is very little customizations allowed.  With the exception of how spicy you would like certain dishes, they won't allow you to have noodles rather than rice as the starch in your entrée, or any other customizations.  If you want fried rice, you must order a dish from the menu with precisely that. Don't even think your request to swap different vegetable out will be entertained.
         Second, there are only three dessert selections.  I ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake, which was the best part of the meal.)"

It's barely a mile from the long-standing ""Super Buffet"" a little further west, so I'm not sure why there is a need for two so close to each other.

The Royal Buffet has the usual standard chicken beef and pork dishses on the steam table. It seemed like they were a little lacking during my visit - the chicken teriyaki tasted like simple grilled chicken. Aside from being well charred, it had no flavor. The chicken and brocolli was drowning in sauce. Something labeled ""pork chop"" was large slices of, I assume, pork mixed with vegetables. The highlight of the tables was the full size ribs, which were meaty and delicious.

There is also a separate area for sushi. Most of the time, the sushi at a Chinese buffet is sort of an after thought. Not so here. This is a mini-sushi bar with several different rolls and salmon, shrimp, crab stick and other nigiris. There is also a sign posted that they will make several different sushi items to order at no extra charge. I made two visits for these fresh rolls and was stuffed.

My glass of water was refilled often. The restaurant looked clean and the staff checked the condition of the buffet table on a regular basis.

Overall, I was pleased with the Royal Buffet. I would recommend the sushi more - for $12 including soda and tip, a pretty good deal.)"

In a large strip plaza, Las Americas is over to the west side and has an easily identifiable store front. Big letters with their name.

I was offered a table and a few minutes later, brought a menu. The young lady pointed to the specials and I immediately chose one of those. Not long, a big bowl of black beans followed by a platter of food was placed before me.

Interesting combination of spiced ground beef, fried plantains, white rice and a cold side which I enjoyed thoroughly. I quite literally cleared the plate. Absolutely delicious and while not ""hot"" it was spicy with tasty flavor.

Big plate of food, less than $8. Another few bucks for a tip and I was on my way.)"

For 12:30 on a weekday, the place was barely a third filled. The three hostesses were clearly underworked trying to organize the few customers into tables.

PF Chang's has a special lunch menu if you want to save a few bucks. I had the Almond and Cashew Chicken with brown rice. The $10 meal comes with a bowl of egg drop or hot & sour soup. There was plenty of chicken (not fried! yay!) and a large serving of rice - enough to take half of the meal home in a nice container. The sauce was very flavorful, though it seemed to be a little light on both the almonds and the cashews.

One friend ordered the Combination Lo-Mein from the main menu and was very satisfied. He said that there was plenty of beef, chicken and shrimp in there.

The waiter was attentive without being overbearing. He mentioned that each of the staff has their own recipe for the condiments, preparing his own recipe in front of us. If you ask me, it seemed a little silly, but it's part of the charm that is PF Chang's. After the meal, he brought over the dessert tray. The cheesecake and mini-cheesecakes looked good, as did the six-layer chocolate cake that must have been the size of a small football. We declined.

Good service, good food, a decent price for a lunch meal.),(Although I was an on-looker as my family went shark eyes (grubbin so hard their eyes roll back to protect them) while eating the sesame chicken, shrimp lomein, fired rice, and lettuce wraps, I couldn't stop my nose, and it was telling me, ""dammmnnn.""  They vouched that the taste matched the delectable aroma. I  formally thank Philip Chiang for entering the culinary world with his mother's authentic recipes as inspiration and restaurateur Paul Fleming in creating this restaurant!),(We went to PF Chang's today, you know as far as chains go it is decent.  There is bound to be something for even the biggest food snob and the timid eater.  Isn't that what a chain restaurant is?  Food for the masses?

We had shrimp dumplings, Mongolian beef and shrimp, scallop & snowpeas.  Not my choices, but I was with two people, I just let them order and we shared, no biggie.  Sometimes you just have to go with the flow.

Service was great.  In fact, our server was so professional, I need to send PF Changs an email, he was perfect.  He was friendly, never intrusive and knew we were celebrating a birthday and brought us cake, he didn't have to do all that!!  

I like to go to PFC about 3 times a year.  It is what it is!),(I read a review earlier about pf changs that fully captures my opinion of the place. It's consistent and the food is good and well-prepared. Now I'll admit, my Asian friends and family back home tend to give pf changs a bad rap because its not authentic. And, well it's not authentic. It more asian fusion than it is Chinese, but that's ok. It takes some of the flavors and influences that are more universally appealing and appreciated and makes signature dishes out of those. And it is pretty well executed, in my opinion. 

I've been to a number of Pf changs locations over the years and I like this location a lot. I actually dined here two weeks ago and my wife, friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. The waitstaff was excellent. Our food was fresh and delicious and the bar is decent too. I like my experience there and honestly have never had a bad pf changs experience ever.)"

Now, fine dining isn't typically my scene, but Fig Tree makes me take a second glance at the ""use your salad fork"" mantra. 

The inside is incredible intriguing. It's an old house off of 7th street with tons of history. The historic Lucas House that was originally built in 1913 and boy it shows. However, it has been kept in immaculate condition. Definitely go explore both the 1st and 2nd floor. Lots of cool things to see. 

The mini bar in the foyer is so rad. Only a few seat, one bartender, a small tv. Quaint and perfect. 

We sat inside since it was a bit chilly. There is some outside seating, which would be fantastic for a spring\/summer dining experience. 

Apps: Apple Beggar's Purse was one of the most decadent and sought after dishes of the evening. Savory, sweet and addicting. The thyme butter sauce will make your taste buds deliriously happy. 

Escargots were fantastic. Best I've had to date. Tender, garlic-filled bites of once shell-inhabiting morsels. Worth the try if they'll be your first. 

Entrees: Lamb Chops were amazing. Cut was thick, flavor was smokey and rich. Cooked to perfection. 

Ok, so I'm not typically a filet kind of guy, but The Fig Tree made me shut my skeptical mouth. Veal demi glace? Are you kidding me? WHOA. Also, topped with amazing cheese and a mushroom mixture that was sining in the foreground of your pallet the entire time.

Throughout the entire evening, service was professional, kind, witty, fun and helpful. Great staff. They hire and train well. These people know their stuff. The way it's supposed to be. 

My hat's off to you, Fig Tree. You've made fine dining a pleasant experience and I look forward to saving up enough money to come back and visit you once more!),(Finally, we're finding places in Charlotte we love. It's official- I love Fig Tree. It's very quaint (a cute house) and the service is top-notch. While they were very busy, it's organized as such where you don't feel you're in a crowded restaurant or too close to the other tables. Very intimate setting, little fireplace, lovely bar, beautiful stairway leading to the restrooms upstairs.

Make a reservation- we did. We arrived early and were seated at promptly 8:45, our reservation time. Our server was very sweet and knowledgeable, explaining the menu and some of the signature dishes. The bread was divine and went perfectly with the escargot appetizer we ordered, accompanied with mushrooms and a gorgonzola\/ garlic sauce. He encouraged us to dip our bread in the sauce, which we did- and oh boy. Heaven in your mouth.

I ordered the ahi special (he said it was one of the finest cuts he had seen in a very, very long time) and it was also delicious. It came with a risotto and everything was cooked to perfection.

I really love The Fig Tree and am excited to find such a charming spot in Charlotte.),(Fine dining - you bet! This restaurant is in a restored historic house and beautifully done at that. Each room is small enough so that you feel like you are privately dining.
The service is very well trained and professional. The servers know and understand the food, preparations and ingredients - that is so nice. Service is usually very prompt  and well paced, although we have waited a little longer than we would have liked between courses on a few occasions, but on balance we have not seen this to be an issue whatsoever.
The wine list is extensive and well priced. I noticed that they have won the Wine Spectator award of excellence for many years in a row. 
I would say you will find the seafood and chops are just superb. The chops range from Veal, Elk, Pork. and Lamb (on our visits). We have tried them all and for meat lovers they are not to be missed. Something I very much admire and respect is our meats always come out at the ordered temperatures. Thisis something less quality restaurants will bring an adventure of hit and miss.
For appetizers we love the beggars purse, beef carpaccio and the foie gras. We don't usually eat dessert but have liked the Beignets. 
I would be wiling to recommend this restaurant to anybody who loves fine dining.)"

Of course. Thought that we'd give it a try since we tend to eat more of the flexitarian\/vegetarian variety these days. 

A little hard to find (across South Blvd from Chipotle and next to Icehouse) but once we found it, it was awesome. 

Comfortable setting, warm greeting from our server and tons of warm bodies behind the make line busting and prepping. 

Tons of fresh fruit and veggies stacked on old bookshelves, freshly baked cookies cooling out in the dining area and a wonderfully high ceiling for a nice open dining space. 

Here's a tip: GET A JUICE. They are fantastic. So fresh and packed with nutrients. The El Diablito was our choice. Carrot, apple and orange. It was delightful. 

Breakfast was so bright and full of flavors. The Muesli is quite citrusy and spiced well with nutmeg. Tons of fresh fruit. All good. Our server told us that they make their own almond milk and coconut. Fascinating. 

The parfait was the best part of breakfast. My wife and I were both impressed. the coconut yogurt was delicious and had a nice touch of vanilla. 

Friendly, attentive staff, cozy and unique. What a great local business to check out in South End!

Can't wait to head back for lunch and try the Lunasagna! Thanks, Luna's!),(A little disappointed that they were out of the veggie burger but it just made me try something new and I'm so glad I did the living burrito was awesome!  Followed up by a vegan macaroon and the best cup of coffee ever.  I'm still thinking about the coffee why does it taste so good?  I recommend asking for some coconut milk with your coffee addicting.),(While I don't think I could ever eat (and live) life as a vegan or even a vegetarian, Luna's Living Kitchen gave me a really nice experience with that potentially difficult cuisine! 

I strolled in for a leisurely lunch and ordered up Lunasagna and a lemonade, upon the nice staffer's recommendation. Price wise, Luna's is higher than you'll pay at many a local spot, but the incredibly fresh ingredients can't be cheap (my lunch came to $15). I snagged a stool seat and took in a bit of work for about 10 minutes or so before my order came out. 

My Lunasagna was so fresh and just gorgeous. Seriously - go check out my picture. The portions were ample and I was really surprised by all the flavor that burst out of the layers, sauce, strands of veggies and cashew bits. The greens accompanying the lunasagna were just about perfect, so much so that next time I'll focus more on a salad packed with Luna's delicious produce. 

For those who think that vegan cuisine is boring and bland, I recommend trying a meal at Luna's. It may not change your way of life or daily cuisine, but the flavor packed items will surprise you in the best way!),(My first Luna's experience was on Fat Tuesday- kind of ironic. We stopped in for take-out last night, much needed after a very foodie Mardi Gras weekend in New Orleans. 

So, everything is vegan, raw and ""living"" if you will. A lot of options for interesting dishes- we had the falafel trio and I ordered the Divinity Bowl. Interesting to see ""cauliflower rice."" Not enough curry flavor in the mix of vegetables- the sauce was at the bottom and it was minimal. The falafel was much more flavorful... I especially liked the vegetables that came with it, had an interesting bite to them. I'm no stranger to vegan or raw restaurants, and while the food was good, it wasn't the best I have ever had.

I do wish they had fresh juice- all the juice is in pre-packaged bottles- which seems impractical for an earth-friendly place. Apparently they don't accept old glass bottles, either. In my opinion, skip the bottles and go for a biodegradable cup, or better yet, put fresh juice in said cup. As a marketer I get the branding aspect, but I'm sure the customers are left with dozens of glass bottles that they don't know what to do with... although I have no idea why anyone would repeatedly spend $10 on a bottle of pre-packaged juice. I'd rather go to Earth Fare and get one fresh for $5.),(This is the adorable little vegan place that you did not expect to find in the land of BBQ. Luna's is like the little hippie English major you knew from college whose parents love NASCAR while she quotes Yeats(and that time you had dinner with her folks, things just didn't make any sense at all).

Anyhow - The fire & brimstone burger is pretty darn good. So is the lasagna.

However, the real winner is the hummus plate with cranberry bread. Although the portion is small, the flavor packs a huge punch. Do not miss this item.)"

Don't ever come here!!  

Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w\/ dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a ""but"" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there?) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much?  LOL)

Total bill was just under $50, w\/ minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w\/ some of the meat tougher than the others.

Decided to grab a quick bite to eat while the rest of the family went shopping, so I popped over to the food court to see what I could find.  Among the national food chains, such as Chick Fil-A, The Great Steak & Potato Co., Sbarro, Orange Julius, and Subway, I spotted Showmars and recalled reading a few good reviews on it, so I made a beeline and checked out the menu, which proved to be quite extensive: gyros, souvlakis, burgers, pita burgers, seafood platters, including fried flounder, hot dogs, and even baklava by the silce ($1.99, fyi)!  Service seemed very friendly and eager to help.  

After a few minutes and a few questions, I decided to go w\/ an Old-fashion Jr. pita burger (chili, cheese, coleslaw, onions, and mustard), hold the mustard, and a side of fries, for a grand total of $6.  (FYI, Jr. burgers feature one patty, regular has two.)  Combo plates were available, but I didn't want anything from the soda fountain.  Paid for the meal and was given a receipt and a buzzer.  Thought I'd check out the buffet spread at Maki of Japan (right across from Showmars) in the meantime, but I hadn't even crossed the path of chairs and tables to get to the other side of the room when my buzzer started to vibrate-- that was fast!  

My platter looked very nice, but I lamented that my pita burger lacked surface veggies, not even lettuce (!), and the manager told me that only the original burgers had lettuce and tomato.  However, he offered to add lettuce for me- very nice!  I enjoyed the chili-burger-coleslaw combo; however, I did find the whole sandwich a bit sweeter than I'd prefer-- most likely from the sugar in the coleslaw.  Also, I would've eaten more of the pita had it been crisped\/toasted.  No matter, as eating less of the pita allowed me to enjoy more of the crinkle-cut fries- the best part of the entire meal!  Those who like saltier fries may want to grab a salt packet or two, as my fries were a bit under-salted, even for my taste.

I arrived to my appointment and was happy to see that the salon looked just as nice in person as it does in photos. I picked out my colors and was led over to a pedicure chair, where I opted for rose petals (over lavender) in my soaking water. 

The chair, I felt, was a little uncomfortable. The woman doing my pedicure got to work while another woman came over to give me my gel soak-off. Or so I thought. After my gels were off, she went right into the manicure. So I had my mani and pedi going at the same time. I can see how this might be a benefit for someone who needed to get in and out, but I felt like I couldn't relax and enjoy!

Right away, I noticed that the polish for my hands looked a little thick, but the mani proceeded. When my services were over, I gave at least 20 minutes of drying time before heading out. I received 5% off with the Check-In Offer, which was great as services are pricey. 

By the time I got back to my hotel room, I realized one of my nails already looked a little smudged. Within 48 hours, nearly all of my nails were chipped. My manicures at my usual salon typically last at least five days so to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. On the other hand, my pedicure is doing much better. 

Maybe I picked the wrong polish or it was an off day, but I wasn't super happy with my experience overall. Mostly because the results of my mani were so poor. Three days later, I've already removed the polish because my nails looked so bad. Bummer!)"

Some good, some not so good. This is one of better ones. Not only is it fun and full of delicious food, but it's just so well done and well executed.

Competition Dining is an Iron Chef-type event that travels to five areas of North Carolina. It pits local chefs\/restaurants against each other with a secret North Carolina ingredient(s). Winners then move on to compete against the victors in the other regions.

Not only do you get to enjoy six fabulous courses... you also get to the judge!! Each diner gets to vote on a wide range of factors for each dish. It's all done on your smart phone. 

I had the honor of attending two of these Fire in the City competitions. The Asbury versus Upstream and Mimosa Grill and Fish Market. It's just amazing to see how these chefs work with the ingredients they are given. I just couldn't imagine cooking a three course meal for 150 people.

Competition Dining makes for a great way to celebrate an anniversary or birthday. Different and unique from your standard let's go out to dinner experience. Both nights I had couples celebrating anniversaries at my tables.

These events do sell out. My suggestion to you is to buy tickets as soon as they go on sale. 

So, I had 12 courses of food. What was my personal favorite? Chef Chris Coleman's (The Asbury) Cast Iron Certified Angus Beef Brand Ribeye, Yukon Gold Chevre Puree, Roasted Mirepoix Uncle Scott's Root Beer Demi-Glace. Tremendous.

Kudos to Competition Dining on such a fantastic event series.)"

There's refrigerators with cold cans which is my jam. I gravitate towards the ""Burial"" brewery cans because they are gorgeous! The illustration on the can itself is great entertainment. Theres a few high top tables inside for hanging out, community style... make a new friend! There's lots of shelves with beers from around the world, just tell the bartender what you're in the mood for and he will give you tons of great options, he's a cicerone (beer equivalent of wine sommelier)!

While it's not great pizza, it is absolutely very good pizza. Brick oven baked, rather than the usual gas oven stuff, it is a bit more charred around the edges and this adds a different flavor - a good one - to the pie.

The buffet has a salad which is nice and tasty, but don't decieve yourself into thinking that's a healthier choice than the pizza. It's got a good amaount of dressing on it. And really, you're at a pizza place. Have the pizza!

And for the pizza choices, it was a nice variety though not spectacular. The focus here is on the tasty crust and not the creative toppings. What are you expecting for $9? Pepperoni and sausage and peppers and mushrooms and the like. The pesto-topped pizza was tasty.

A very nice lunch option at a great lunch price for very tasty brick-oven pizza. I can see why Luisa's is so popular!),($8 for an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet? It sure beats the heck out of others I've experienced elsewhere and the offerings are straightforward, well-executed, and not withholding on variety. We came in at peak lunch hours and still managed to grab a seat, indulge, and get out in about 35 minutes. 

The buffet is small, but awesome. A few tasty salad options at the start and a generous variety of pizzas. Several vegetarian options, some with meat, some plain, some more complex. My favorite was the pepperoni with pesto and any that had a blackened crust. I'm a large proponent, and of the school, in blackened pizza. A well-done crust, rather. This flavor is key and it makes the flavors really sing in a properly developed dough. The hearth of that gorgeous oven is making a rather fine pie. Where the buffet is awesome, some of the pies were getting shucked in and out quickly, so the middle was a little underdone. No worries, though. The black crust totally made up for it. 

In and out for the two of us at $20 is a steal and well worth it. I'm really looking forward to visiting again soon. Here's to you with a well-deserved tip of the hat, Luisa's. I'll be back soon.),(Ehhhh it breaks my heart to write less than stellar things about a pizza joint, even more so about a local pizza joint. 

I've been on the prowl for delicious pizza - of any kind (NY or Chicago) for more than three years now. Thus I was really, REALLY hoping that Luisa's dished out a delicious pie. The overall experience really left me with ""meh.""

Hubs and I walked into Luisa's to enjoy a relaxed Friday afternoon meal and wanted to sit outside to enjoy the great weather. Our initial greeting from the gentleman (owner? manager?) was so sweet - he genuinely seemed happy to help us. I had high hopes at that point...and then our waitress took over and it went down hill...fast.

We decided to forgo the buffet and order an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and a 'za - intending to take some home. The mozza sticks were good...however I've never had a bad piece of fried cheese. Then we waited for our 'za - not too long, though! In 15 - 20 minutes or so our pie came out...wrong. The waitress must have misinterpreted our order, but no worries...we decided to eat it anyway. That's all on us...not complaining about that. 

The problems were 1) the waitress never brought us silverware, red pepper flakes, extra napkins, etc., so hubs kept going inside to grab these necessary items. Tres annoying. 2) the pizza was full of grease. I'm normally a ""pizza blotter"" anyway, but this was an obscene amount of grease. Ack. After I blotted away, the pizza was just ok - not very inspired. Very little flavor and super bland. I expected a tasty, crispy crust too, considering the ""brick oven""...but alas it was sub par. We brought the majority of the pizza home...and I don't think we ever ate it. That tells you something because I will typically eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

As Todd W. said - we both really wanted to like Luisa's but it just fell short. Maybe the waitress and the brick ovens were having an off day? Sad 'za, sad face.)"

I went to lunch here Wednesday with Mike M. We both went with the chilled corn soup. It had a a custard in the bottom. It was fantastic. Such clean and fresh flavors. I got the tacos. I did one of the marinated 'shrooms and one of the coastal North Carolina seafood of the day (Wed it was shrimp). Both of these were really great.  If you go tacos, I recommend doing two different ones and doing a seafood of the day for one of those.

Things to know: The Asbury validates for the Fifth Third parking deck next door. If there's a table outside, get it. Great people watching for dinner. During lunch, there is always something going on in that little park looking area across the street. Wednesday there was a jazz band.

I remember when this building was used as a ""pop-up gallery"" for gallery crawl nights and kept a steady, unwelcoming ambiance to all who entered. No more, ladies and gents. This space has been transformed to an open, wood floored space with ample seating. 

Where I love the direction that Miyagi's is going, I have to say there are some drawbacks and shortcomings. Here's what we had:

Edamame. Just fine. Hot, salted and a great starter. 

Ginger salad. Decent. I enjoyed the mix of romaine and spinach, but the dressing was a little lacking in that nice ginger punch I look for. 

Bibimbop. This is probably the coolest presentation and most filling item on the menu. A bowl filled with rice, veggies, and tons of other great things to add in -- kimchi, marinated tofu, bean sprouts, miso paste, and spicy cucumbers. I'd get this upon next visit hands down. 

Sushi. There are only 5 or so options on the menu. I hate to say it, but it was just yuck. An obscene amount of rice, whisper of nori, cucumber, avocado etc, and an even more miniscule amount of fish. Not that it can't be improved (I've heard it's better when the sushi chef is in the kitchen) but I didn't even finish the rolls I ordered. Rather unfortunate, but I'm sure it will improve over time. 

Service was awesome. Our server was fun, funny, and totally kept the mood light throughout our dinner. 

The menu isn't strong, but I believe there is a well-deserved ""yet"" in there somewhere. Again, it's a killer space, prime space on N Davidson St, comfortable seating, big glass windows, and room to make a much more enticing menu.

This isn't the closest Chinese restaurant to my house, but it's the one I choose to consistently order from in the Elizabeth area. To me, it seems like the food isn't as greasy and oily as the others and it tastes like better quality. 

I have to order egg drop soup every time I get Chinese. I really like the version they do here. I typically also get Singapore noodles, an egg roll, and a spring roll. I'll mix it up from time to time with some sort of spicy chicken or shrimp dish and steamed dumplings. Everything I've had from here has been good, I can't think of a single thing I haven't liked. 

Delivery is typically quick. Getting take out is a breeze. During my latest trip here this week, the guy in front of me asked how long it would take, 15 minutes? He needed to go outside and make a call. I told him don't stay outside too long, it'll take no time. Sure enough, his order came out with mine quickly and all I had ordered was soup. 

They do have a website, basically the only thing on it is the menu. You can find a clickable link here on 88's Yelp page.),(And the skies opened and I could hear ""Hallllllllllllllllelujah!"" Tasty Chinese food in Charlotte! 

I was practically convinced that after almost 4 years in Charlotte I was never going to find solid, convenient and fresh Chinese food. Therefore, stating that I was impressed with 88 China Bistro is putting it mildly. 

The take out menu is traditional (Americanized Chinese) with far fewer fried dishes (thank God). Many, if not all, of the items are freshly made in house and it shows. Hubs picked up a myriad of take out and brought it home so we could feast. Here's what I tried...

Sesame Cold Noodle Appetizer: 4\/5: For $4.50, this dish is a steal. Plenty of perfectly cooked noodles with a generous helping of peanut-y, sesame dunked sauce on top. The sauce is thicker, so be sure to spread the love around before you dive in. Simple yet de-freakin'-licious. 

Beef & Broccoli: 4\/5: I'll completely agree with Lindsay H - their beer & broccoli is pretty fab. It's freshly made and the sauce isn't that coagulated, syrupy crap. The broccoli is tender and still has a bit of a crunch. 

Fried rice: 3\/5: I appreciate that it's fresh, it just could have used a bit more flavor and a bit less soy. 

I'm looking forward to my lunch today, as it will be chock full of leftovers from last night's 88 China Bistro meal. One of these days I want to head over there and ask for this elusive Cantonese menu.)"

I had bookmarked it after its ROTD for the longest time, but I've just not managed to make it over here at breakfast time. (Which is not to suggest that Toast is *only* breakfast!)

At 10:00 in the morning, I was wanting something delicious. And since I can't go to the Flying Biscuit at the moment (don't ask - it's cool), I let my Yelp app bring me here instead. Not much of a crowd - three other tables had some folks at them. Some mommies at two, a business meeting at another. And me, a table of one.

What to have? What to have? Eggs, of course. And toast, of course. What arrived a short while later was a mushroom and cheese omelet with two half slices of sour dough toast. The omelet was perfectly cooked and the toast was perfectly toasted, but to be honest, I was a little sad that a restaurant with the name of Toast only gave me a single slice that was cut in half. Sad face.

Service was friendly and good. Plenty of good coffee. The wifi worked great and I sat there for a good 45 minutes until my battery ran down.

I'll be back!),(There's a guy outside dressed up like a piece of toast. How could you not like this place?!

The key phrase you must remember if you want to have brunch here: arrive early. They do not take reservations. Expect a wait. However, it's not so bad. Toast has a complimentary coffee bar (cute little paper cups) and cornhole outside. The place is hopping. Diverse crowd. Kids, families, boozy brunchers, dogs of all kinds.

Our group of seven arrived at 10AM Sunday. The wait for us was only around ten minutes. We were seated outside on the patio. Beautiful day for brunch outside.

I debated forever on my order. Basically, I fought with myself over which version of eggs benedict to get. Come on, there's nothing better than cutting into a soft poached egg and watching the delicious drizzle. I finally landed on the Cali Benny: Poached Eggs, Avocado, Tomato, English Muffin & Hollandaise. Great sauce. It came with a side of potatoes. I'm usually not the biggest fan of home fries, but these were seasoned and yummy. Didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce. I ate everything on my plate.

Quite possibly my favorite thing about this place: you pay at the counter. Think about it. When you go to brunch, you usually have to split your check up a bunch of different ways. Takes time for a server to do that, close everyone out. Here, you just take your check and go straight to the cashier. Makes turnover time for tables quicker.

I'm definitely a fan. If I can ever get my crew going by 10am, this is the place we'll hit up for some breakfast goodness. Now if only we could get the state of North Carolina to serve me a mimosa before noon on a Sunday....),(It seems like Charlotte has a shortage of non-chain breakfast locales. Sure, we have plenty of Bo Jiggles (Jangles), a few diners, and a handful of upscale breakfast\/brunch locales. But how about the moderately priced? Toast fills that void. 

When I worked in Huntersville a few years back I adored that Toast location. ADORED. I would swoon over the quiche, the fast, family like service and the adorable home the restaurant was housed in. Well, that location closed, and a few years later, now we have a Toast in Dilworth. The expansive space feels different, but the menu still offers a variety of breakfast and lunch items that will surely please the masses.

I stopped in on a Friday morning, so I had zero trouble grabbing a table. This environment is very, very different that the weekend. Pack your patient pants if you are looking for a meal on a Saturday or Sunday morning. 

Service was friendly and quick and efficiently brought over my order - the strawberry and cream cheese French toast. It was a hearty plate filled with four diagonally cut French toast pieces, filled with the fair amount of sweetened cream cheese and a few strawberries. I would have preferred more strawberries and a bit more pizazz, but it was flavorful nonetheless. I chose sausage patties for my side and they sufficed just fine. 

Overall, Toast is a solid breakfast spot and seeing the huge crowds it pulls on Saturday and Sunday alone, I imagine they'll do just fine.),(Brunch, brunch, brunch. It was a surprise to find a place on a Monday that served breakfast after 1PM (I think we went around 2), but it was MLK Day and it felt like a Sunday to me. So anyway, cute place... we were seated by the window and didn't have a wait. Woohooo! Open space, yet cozy interior. I ordered the Cali Benny- love that hollandaise sauce, even better with avocado- which was delicious. Fresh and not ridiculously filling. I also tried the banana-peanut butter pancakes, which were interesting as well. Toast is a pretty solid spot, so I'll definitely be back.

Oh- and as we left, we asked for a coffee to go- the very nice employee gave us a complimentary cup, so naturally we left him a couple of dollars as a thank-you.)"

The location is cut into two sections. The front is a Ethiopian general store. They sell ingredients for Ethiopian food, DVDs, soda, exotic spices, and kitchen gadgets to make your flat bread on. 
The back area is a restaurant. Their menu is literally one page, for the entire restaurant. If someone else is looking it over, you're going to have to wait. There's only about 5 things to choose from, so it's not a big decision. 
We had cabbage and onions, served with collard greens, and beans, all served on a large piece of flat bread. We had to have the waitress explain what we were having, since the menu descriptions are rather loosely worded, and mainly in Ethiopian. The food was heavily spiced, and delicious. The beans had a delicious smoky flavor, and the cabbage had some sort of yellow hot spice on them. 
The staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful, but with rather limited English. They were alarmed when they saw that the Coca-Cola was 'beyond the expiration date,' and insisted that we not drink it. I've never paid attention to the Coke expiration dates stamped on the bottom of the can.

Mystery beer is interesting....$1 and you'll, most likely, get a crappy beer. Haha. Worth the $1 laugh it brought to our table. Bud Light with lime. GAG.

Apps:

Started out with the potato cakes. These things are awesome. Plenty of veggies and in a creamy curry-ish sauce. I would have mistaken them for falafel had I not been told. I was happy and so were my taste buds. Throw a little sriracha on these bag boys and you'll experience Krazy enlightenment. 

Entrees:

My wife got a fried veggie burrito. This thing rivals the size of a Chipotle or Moe's burrito. Packed full of rice and tons of tasty veggies. Loved the sauce that the veggies were sautéed in. Welcomingly sweet and a came full circle with the rest of her plate. The grits on the side were so thick and creamy. I'd have a full plate on my next visit if it were an entree. Delicious. 

I tried the blackened tuna tacos. Holy crap. Pineapple salsa? I'd eat that on my foot. It was so good. Perky, cilantro-ey and so FRESH. I love every bit. Huge chunks of rare, seared tuna. The slaw, I'm pretty sure, is tossed in a bit of wasabi powder so it got dumped off my tacos lickity split. No offense. Just not a fan of wasabi. Got a side of the mac n' cheese per Chad's recommendation. So good. Soul food, meet Mexican. Be friends, I say. 

Sampled the blueberry salsa and the chipotle honey. Very interesting. Look forward to trying them on their respective dishes on our next visit. 

I'm happy to say Krazy Fish literally is crazy but absolutely intriguing. I can't wait to test more of the menu. Well done, ladies and gents. You've got something going here.),(What's my new favorite place for casual eats in the Queen City?  You guessed it Krazy Fish.  If you want to have the same experience I had  I suggest grabbing a seat on the patio - asking for Susan to wait on you - order a couple of mojitos and some tacos.  What kind of tacos?  Well the one thing I can say about Krazy Fish is you will have plenty of options to choose from  and there is a lot more than just  tacos on the menu,  Ceviche, steak, curry's, tofu, etc. etc.  On the recommendation of some great yelp reviews I went with the tacos.  I was so happy with my meal the pulled pork taco was my favorite and Danielle G. right on with the Pink Gold sauce it truly was a amazing.  Put this place on the top of your list to try and save room for the berry cobbler a completely unexpected delicious surprise.  Oh and before I forget the prices rock.),(It's crazy inside Krazy Fish...that's for damn sure. Paint splattered booths, sparkly countertops, a mishmash of menu items, blow up doll caught in a net...but I dig it! Although the place was quite quiet during lunch yesterday, a few friends and I enjoyed a tasty meal. 

Our server was most excellent - a mash up of tattoos & Southern charm - with many honeys, sweeties, and dolls thrown about. I fully appreciate when the server gives solid suggestions, too! We started out by splitting an order of the ceviche - a magnanimous portion of fresh, lime laden fish with plenty of onion, tomato and cilantro to amp up the flavor. The portion was generous and the taste was right on. Plus, our fab server brought out a bottle of guacamole so we could douse to our liking. 

For my meal, I chose the blackened tuna tacos with pineapple salsa\/slaw and a side of jalapeno cheddar grits. Two large tacos arrived with plenty of tuna and mounds of tasty pineapple slaw stuffed into fried soft shell tortillas. Let me tell you - I love me a fried tortilla. Taste-ay. The combo of the pineapple and tuna was bright and the grits, albeit a bit heavy, had great flavor and texture. I would have been totally game if they were a bit spicier, too. 

I like this kinda crazy, Krazy Fish.),(My best friend in Charlotte lives in Plaza Midwood and is a big fan of seafood. And we've both found it difficult to find good seafood in Charlotte. So when he told me that he found a place where he had good Chilean sea bass and a lobster tail for under $20, I was pretty skeptical. But naturally, I was prepared to give it a try.

So we went one evening in December around finals time. It was a cool spot. I wasn't really sure what to expect walking in. It wasn't a fancy place at all, but the decor had its own appeal and charm to it. It had a variety of streamers, lights and...well ""flair."" Like it or not, it's definitely not something you see everyday. Plenty of seating, a cool tiki bar, clean, terrific and attentive service...not sure if there was any outdoor seating though. 

But the highlight was the food. There were many cool options to choose from. They consider themselves soul seafood fusion and the menu options did not disappoint. The special was halibut with lobster tails and rice. Absolutely delicious. The best seafood that I've had in Charlotte. I also had to try the gumbo, because, well, I'm a fan of gumbo. And I'm now a fan of their gumbo. The meal was terrific and very reasonably priced. It was so great in fact, that I ordered shrimp and grits to go for my wife (who has to work late.) she was pleasantly surprised and loved it too! We can't wait to go back.)"

Though I'm not the hugest fan of baked goods to the tune of cupcakes, cakes, cookies,...or really anything cake-y, for that matter, but I like this place. Here's why:

Sometimes, normal biz hours aren't within the constraint of my day's allowance and, thus, I typically don't get a chance to visit many places that close before 6pm. Luckily, these fine people are open until 7pm most weekdays, and we made it in just before then. The employee, can't remember her name, was very welcoming and invited us right on in. The hours on the door may say they close at 6pm, but their Yelp info is right! Huge win here. Otherwise, we would have just turned around. 

The interior is quaint and riddled with pink, pink items, pink edibles, and other pinkable pinking pink-type things. Again, I'm not the biggest fan of cupcakes, but we happily obliged for the chocolate birthday cake and baker's choice for the day -- a white cake with chocolate frosting. Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. I think they had been sitting out for a while that day, but if the cake part had been fresh, I'm sure it would have been better. The buttercream on both were very, very well executed. Not stacked too high like some other places, which I greatly appreciate. As a mustache & beard holding gentleman, high frosting is a disaster. We also ordered a very, very, very good santa cookie. Dude, give me a glass of milk or cup of coffee with one of those jokers again and I'm a happy camper. Soft cookie, light frosting, sprinkles, and great vanilla flavor. 

The cake decorating here is very clean, too. Where I can't comment on the cakes themselves, I will say that they are gorgeous. 

Though I don't think the cupcakes are amazing by any constraint, those cookies, the service, and accessibility and variety, this place deserves 4 stars in my book.),(I'm blushing over the fact that yes, I participated in eating four cupcakes.  Hmmmmm. Red velvet, vanilla on chocolate, nutella somethin' somethin' and a chocolate orange.  Rodrick from supper club liked the orange the best. Tonya liked the chocolate cupcake the best and nutella frosting. Cuz, I'm complex like that.)"

Seriously, all of these killer eateries and shopperies in the Kenilworth shopping center are great. I was really stoked to try out Zen as I've read other reviews from friends and seen their rather interesting menu. 

Not sure that I've ever had the fusion of Asian and Spanish Tapas cross my plate ever and I look forward to experiencing it one day. This time around, we went for takeout after being rather tired from moving in and a busy week to top things off. Might of caught these guys on an off night, or it should be enjoyed in-house. Know what I'm sayin?

Here's what we had: 

Salmon sashimi -- Perfect. Simple cuts of fresh salmon. Rather thick, too. Always love the different varieties in cuts and this was just fine. 

Cali roll -- Standard. I was in the mood for something light and that's what I got. It was pleasant. 

Tuna roll -- ??? I've never seen nori that thick, A, and have never seen it laid on the outside of so much rice, B. Also, the nori had a pretty wretched stench. Not sure I've had such a stinky variety before. The tuna was fresh and fine. Should have just picked it out of the middle and went to town!

Summer rolls -- Another ?? They were so weakly wrapped and had pretty nasty tofu as well. Just a huge letdown on flavor and presentation. 

Miso -- Just as it should be. I'm a fan. 

So, I think we missed the boat here in going for takeout. Next time, I want to check out the tapas)"

During the hustle and bustle of traveling, it's always a nice feeling when I have a little extra time during a layover in the Queen City so I can relax for a few moments here.

Sushi in Charlotte. This may not be the first type of food that you think about when you are in the Carolinas, but it's here...and there is a lot of great sushi here. I wouldn't put Hissho up in the ""great"" category, but it's decent, and coupled with its ""great"" location...it's one of my regular stops across the country. 

All of the sushi that I've gotten here has been fresh. The specialty rolls are a little heavy, but good. They do have a lot of options with cream cheese or spicy sriracha. I haven't tried any of their sashimi...I just don't think that this is the spot for it. 

I definitely recommend the next time you fly into Charlotte, and have a little extra time during your layover, give it a go. Relax, sit at a table, have a drink and roll or two, and people watch until your departure time arrives. It's the perfect time waster.),(Actually pretty good sushi for airport food that is.  I guess that my standards or expectations are lower given that it's in North Carolina and in the airport and we're talking sushi not barbeque.  The CLT was spicy, very hot, which is the way I like it.),(I've never spent time in North Carolina, but in the last three months, I've had two layovers in CLT.  Both were very annoying, and both fell during mealtime.  I went to Hissho to eat both times.

The first time, I was rushing to make my connecting flight and stopped off on Hissho to grab a roll.  There was a refrigerated section of to-go food, and the selection was pretty good - standard, sure, but a lot of options.  It took me a minute to pick an eel roll.  I ate it on the plane, and it was good.  It reminded me of the pre-packaged rolls I used to love at the cafeteria in college.  Nothing special, maybe, but satisfying.

So when I passed by Hissho in the same airport on a longer layover just a couple months later, I decided to sit down for some dinner.  I thought about getting another ready-to-go roll, but I made the mistake of opening the menu.  I had just heard Jonathan Gold review a Sinaloan sushi spot on the radio, and he said something like, ""It was good in the way chili fries are good,"" and for some reason that resulted in my ordering something called a Mango Trio.  It was an 8 piece roll with imitation crab, mango, cucumber, and mango-ginger cheese topped with salmon, tuna, and a mango habanero sauce.  I mean what the hell is mango-ginger cheese?  Anyway, the roll was edible but vaguely disgusting, with mediocre fish and an odd, goopy sauce.

My other big mistake was getting a drink.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, and when I saw a chipotle bloody on the menu I decided to go for it.  It was the most disgusting bloody mary I've had in recent memory, very strong with a tinge of thin tomato and a bit of spice.  It had a double shot of vodka, so I guess it was at least functional.  When I got the check, though, I was shocked to see that it cost $14.  My shitty airport meal cost over $30.  Incidentally, service was also very slow.  Surprising considering the setting.

I left for my flight feeling foolish.  I would've been happier with a spicy tuna in a plastic container.  I may come back to Hissho when I fly through CLT, but I won't sit down again.)"

This is a MASSIVE supermarket and they have several aisles of neatly organized foods divided into various ethnic categories, including Indian, Chinese, Hispanic and Other Asian. All sorts of things that we unsophisticated Americans would never know about otherwise. For example, did you know that there are dozens of different kinds of soy sauce?

Yes, they have everything else that you can expect in a ""regular"" supermarket too. So you don't have to worry about that if you're looking to do your shop. Huge butcher (Cut to order? No problem!), fresh produce, even a good collection of beers with some brands that I have not spotted at the local Bi-Lo.

Sadly, I didn't find the exact curry sauces I was looking for, but I did pick up a useful jar of lime pickle and a mango chutney to have with the curry when I do manage to locate it.),(Super G is simply wonderful. Upon entering, there's the sight of bustling restaurant owners picking up 50lb bags of rice, people rustling through produce and scattered throughout the aisles of products. The smell of dried shrimp is pungent and the seafood permeates your clothes for a bit, but it's totally part of the experience. 

There's nothing and everything to be found throughout this ethnic\/international wonderland. First place I've seen in town that carries sugarcane in abundance and so many awesome dried veggies for super cheap. Good luck finding the same quality\/price at some of the other specialty shops in town. 

One of my favorite parts was seeing the butchery and fishmongers cleaning sunfish as we walked by. There were lines everywhere, people waiting for things, sizing items up, comparing, chatting, loading carts with various items. Just the sight of what everyone else was there for made it an experience. 

Mainly I'd come here again just for the experience without a direction of which aisles to go down, specific products to look for, etc. Just wandering the store and checking out all of the different products is worth it. 

I can't wait to go back. Also, be sure to check out the Korean restaurant and Honey Buns in the back right of the store. Worth every penny.),(First of all anything called Super G, love it already.  I was coming home from the beach on 74 and did the quick, skerrrrrrrt in the parking lot on two wheels to check things out.

OMG!  There are aisles and aisles of ethnic items.  I mean serious business.  It's the largest Indian food aisle of spices I have ever seen.  It had the typical asian market covered and the latin Goya products, chips and canned goods.  Plenty of fresh produce.  Ten limes for .99 cents. Three lemons for a dollar.  Just like back in the day.

The most interesting section was the frozen ice cream, yummy mango popsicles, red bean ice cream and other things that I did not know what they were but they were in nice packaging!!  Yay, Super G!  G Money. G whiz.  G Force. Gee, your hair smells terrific.)"

I usually get the Polish Platter (stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, braised cabbage, and potato and cheese pierogis). It's all amazing. I'm a huge fan of the braised cabbage. I always get it instead of mashed potatoes. My roommate loves the Polish sandwich, he usually gets that and a pierogi sampler.

Had a couple of potential restaurants I wanted to try which are new to the restaurant scene. One is the new Famous Toastery that  opened last Wednesday in Huntersville and the other was Babushka's Pierogi near Carolina Place Mall.

After Church was out at 10:30 am, we tried Famous Toastery and it was almost an hour wait. Time to execute Plan B and go to Bubushka's. May sound like a hike but it was only 25 minutes as opposed to an hour and I'm glad we did. Besides, my wife had an exchange she needed to make at Dillard's and that only a little over a mile away.

They open at 11:00 am and we showed up about 11:20 am and were the first patrons in the store.

Simple but elegant layout with an attractive treatment with wood.  You go to the front counter and place your order from off of the overhead menu board. If you have any questions, the staff is more than glad to answer and questions.

My wife is from Pittsburgh which has a very strong Eastern European presence and a Strong Culinary Tradition said Cuisine. I like the Cuisine as well and enjoy it every time I get a chance.

Both of us ordered the Polish Platter which is Kielbasa, 4 potato and cheese Pierogi's, Stuffed Cabbage Roll and Braised Cabbage. My wife wanted Iced Tea which they don't have so she went with water instead. They do have Hot Tea which I love and it was a fragrant Russian type which I have not have in years. It was great.

We waited about 15 minutes and our meal was brought out to our table.  Everything was great with the exception that every thing was luke warm at best. Would have been so much better if it had enough energy to melt to butter or make the sour cream flow.  Only reason I did not give them a higher rating was the temperature of the food.

We talked to another patron also with Pittsburgh ties and she loved the food as well but had the same comments about the serving temperature.

Good flavorful food. Tucked away in the back of small shopping district but they will do well.

Where some of the other businesses in this little Rea Rd plaza are much more frequented, Hawthorne's has really found themselves a great spot in the South Charlotte hood. Taking over from a previous Italian place, these guys found a perfect location in Ballantyne. 

The interior has great appeal. High ceilings, open seating, plenty of bar tables and stools, booths, and standard four-seaters. Love the L-shaped format, as it makes a central area for servers\/expos to run food. No odd bottleneck near the restroom entrances.

Another brilliant aspect, if any of you know Hawthorne's on 7th and have experienced the droves of families with multiple children parading the entire restaurant, is the separate game room. Big windows so you can keep an eye on the little ones, a TV playing kids movies to keep them entertained and plenty of games. Great call. 

The food, per usual Hawthorne's, is great. Tried the ""bottlecaps"" or jalapeño poppers for the first time. No cheese on these bad boys. Just friend jalapeño slices. Brilliant! Now, they just need to score the jalapeño pale from Birdsong. Then we'll be on to something! 

They have really become the great ""neighborhood pizza joint"" in town. Had the Luau pizza, half sans protein, last night and it was great. Also, we sampled a pasta special reminiscent of a scampi that was divine as well. Fettuccine, chicken, gorgeous fresh basil, peppers, and satueed onions. Pretty heavy meal, so we had leftovers. Who doesn't love cold pizza in the morning? Also, any place with PBR on draught is a win in my book.

After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.

Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The ""Crispy crepe"" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!

Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it.),(Had heard some good things about this place and was excited to check it out. I'm not the biggest fan of crepes, but thought it was cool that another creperie was opening in town. 

Located on South Blvd, the parking can be a little hairy. You'll have to grab a meter or score a spot in one of the close garages. Not my ideal situation, but it's pretty cool that it's right off of the street. There is some outdoor seating with umbrellas which are nice, too. Always great to see the hustle and bustle on South during the day. The interior is pretty spacious. Plenty of tables and a small lounge area with some comfy chairs. Tons of natural light coming in their large windows, too. Very welcoming. 

The open kitchen is a HUGE plus, too. Always fun to watch someone make crepes. Great for kids. 

I had no idea when the menu held, so I went with the first sweet crepe on the menu. Maple Cream. This is where these guys lost it for me. It was a pretty standard crepe. Some whipped cream and fruit on the side. But....filled what was the equivalent of low-grade paper canister icing that you find in the grocery store. The worst part? There was SO MUCH of it. It was so overpoweringly sweet that I had to discard almost all of it for it to be slightly enjoyable. Really disappointing. Though, I think some of their savory crepes would be more enjoyable. Hoping to check those out next time. 

I can't say I'll be rushing back it anytime soon, but these guys have a pretty cool setup. Really dig the open kitchen and think some of their concoctions are cool. Worth a shot, in my opinion. Just ask for LESS maple cream, should you venture down that road.)"

Seen these guys around town, at festivals and food truck rallies, but hadn't had the pleasure of checking them out. They were camped out next to NoDa Brewing one evening and it was just perfect. Beer and a food truck. Modern pb&j. 

The prices are waaaaayyyy cheaper than I thought they were going to be. Ended up getting the tarragon chicken soup (I had a bit of a cold), a black bean burger and some seasoned fries. All for about $19.

The black bean burger was one of the most unique I've had in town. Where the burger itself had a less than desirable texture, the flavors were great. There had to be some sort of sriracha or chili cream sauce on it. The spice was great and all of the flavors worked very well together. 

The tarragon chicken soup was awesome. Flavorful broth, but not overpowered by tarragon, with huge portions of chicken and rice. I was a happy camper with my soup opening a can of whoopass on my cold. Take that, winter! Also, much to my glorious surprise, it came with a half sammy. Just a simple grilled cheese, but it was so good. 

The fries: just great. That is all. Didn't need ketchup. 

Another perk is that you can pay with Square on an iPad. The fact that you add a tip and sign yourself is much more intuitive for a food truck. Glad to see so many people have adopted this method. 

I'm looking forward to the next time I get to sample the fare from Herban Legend.),(I've been meaning to score some goods from Herban Legend for a while now and I'm so happy I ran in to (not literally) their food truck off of South Blvd near Icehouse! 

I parked my car and, because of the chilly temps and blustery winds, was nearly knocked over on my way to order! I perused the menu for a few moments, chatted with the owner and decided on the Sicilian chicken panini. He kindly offered to bring my sandwich to my car upon its completion so I didn't have to wait out in the cold. How nice! I paid via Square Up and 5 minutes and $6 later, I was on my way home, sandwich in hand.

The panini did not disappoint! It was toasty, stuffed with chunks of chicken, tomatoes, scallions, creamy feta, spicy sauce (albeit a touch heavy), and a few other veggies mixed in. It was a super flavorful, hearty lunch. I'm looking forward to trying more!),(Stopped for a bite to eat the food truck rally in South End last evening.  There were  four food trucks at the rally: Herban Legend, a cupcake truck, Goody Woody's (tacos, burritos), and Sticks and Cones (ice cream).  I was told Herban Legend is currently one of Charlotte's most popular food trucks, so I went with them.

This truck serves sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and hot dogs.  Most items are in the $6-8 range.  Sides run up to $5 each and non-alcoholic beverages are $1 each.  No combos.  Everything's ordered a la carte.  There's a bit of diversity on the menu -- you can get a French dip, like one of my buddies got, a Cuban sandwich, tostada, curry chicken wrap, and fish and chips.

I went with the shawarma, which is an Arab wrap, for $6.50.  This is one of the truck's top sellers.  I've had my fair share of shawarmas and thought Herban Legend's version was OK.  Theirs includes grilled chicken, Greek tzatziki sauce, tabouleh salad (cold minty salad made with bulgur and parsley), chopped tomatoes and french fries wrapped in flat bread.

The flat bread was grilled so it was hard and brittle.  This caused the wrap to break apart easily once I grabbed the sucker to bite into it.  It was packed with a sufficient amount of ingredients and plenty of sauce, so much so that the sauce was spilling all over the place as I ate.  Overall, it was satisfying, though I'd probably prefer softer bread and it'd be cool if they had some meat options like other shawarma joints offer.

I also ordered a side of Herban's truffle fries, which at $5, is pretty expensive for a side of fries.  They've also got regular fries for $2-3 and honestly, I tried both, and the truffle fries weren't worth the five bucks.  Both styles of fries were alright.  One order of fries is good for 2-3 people.

If I ever get the chance to revisit this truck, I'll probably order the fried green tomato grilled cheese sandwich.  Someone in our group last night ordered this and she loved it.

Beverage options were limited: Coke, Sprite, and bottled water.  The good thing about food trucks is you can BYOB.

Fast and friendly service.  Credit cards are accepted at a 25 cent surcharge.  You sign your receipt on their iPhone and can get the receipt texted or emailed to you.)"

Living just a mile or so away, this Thai restaurant always bewitched me in their green and white strip mall. Thus, there finally came a time to pull over and try some of South End Thai. Service was solid overall, as it is in many Thai restaurants, and the inside is a bit nondescript but clean and simple nonetheless.

Hubs and I tried a smattering of dishes and here's how we fared:

1) Fresh Rolls: 4\/5: Fresh, indeed. Each order comes with 2 large fresh rolls stuffed with the usual suspects - mint, basil, vermicelli, shrimp & lettuce served with a peanut dusted hoisin sauce. 

2) Satay: 3.5\/5: Perfectly cooked chicken on a stick with a tasty but very oily peanut sauce. The flavor was great, but there were many mini pools of oil on top of the peanut sauce. 

3) Pad Thai: 2.5\/5: Not my favorite Pad Thai I've had. While the portions are super generous, the sauce was way too sweet for my liking - almost a sweet and sour\/ketchup taste. The noodles were a a bit overdone and that combined with the too sweet sauce didn't really do it for me. However, I think it's more about what you're used to with Pad Thai - I prefer a non-soaked, drier noodle. Spice level 2 was just fine, but from what I hear there is a big difference between 2 & 3! 

I definitely want to come back and try the pud see ew and see how I like that one. Considering this is the local Thai spot in my 'hood, I want to support them!)"

The menu is classic American entrees that usually come with fries. I had a turkey cheese burger which was okay. Get the sweet potato fries if you remember. My friend had the prime rib, which was surprisingly a really good cut. Not very marbled or fatty, it was an inch thick and it was all meat. With mashed potatoes, it looked excellent.

Service was good. You have to pay attention for navigating to the restaurant. There are a couple of fast food places and none of them have an entrance through their parking lot.

Here's where I take off the third star. Why did I get charged $2.49 for a soda water? This simple glass of carbonated water (no Coke syrup) maybe cost them 25 cents and that's if I dropped the glass. What a ripoff here. Seriously.),(Came for lunch with coworkers, and it's a really large restaurant. Unfortunately, our service was a bit slow from beginning to end. I tried the roll that they were famous for, and it was just okay. It was odd that they only gave us 5 for a party of 7.

What did I do?  Switched my flight to an earlier one and made it in time to watch the Falcons lose... in historic fashion.  Yes, still salty about it.  However, Hickory Tavern made it easy to be able to watch the game on one of many, many TVs they have in the restaurant. 

Hickory Tavern, located in the Metropolitan Complex, is your basic sports bar with basic bar food and lots of big TVs and even a projector.  They have plenty of tables (bar, stool, booth, and table) and also space outside.  It was conveniently located within walking distance to the Sheraton\/Le Meridien hotels, which we were staying at.  Making a reservation over the phone was easy peasy and we had our table as soon as we got there.  Service was pretty good, considering it was Super Bowl.  We didn't get a menu for a while, but after ordering, someone was always checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

The food itself was just okay.  We ordered a dozen oysters and these were the biggest oysters I'd ever seen... but they also were some of the worst oysters I've ever had.  Tasted like straight ocean and had a really weird texture.  Meh.  We also ordered hot wings which were pretty much your basic hot wings.  Nothing to call home about.  Now, the sweet potato fries and the tater tots we ordered with it - THAT's where it was at.  Scarfed those things down like nobody's business.  I liked that they were nice and crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Yum.  The queso and chips was also very solid.

No free parking here, you're probably going to be looking for a spot on the street.),(Uptown's sole grocery store. Convenient if you just need a couple things, but don't fill up your buggy. It's pricey (even for the Teeter world) and the selection is a bit limited.

If you're in hurry, it's a great place to grab a quick meal. Salad bar, Chinese buffet, sub and pizza station. A lot of options for pre-made meals.

There's also a ""cop"" who stands at the stairs near the door to watch you shop.

One big bonus: I swear, there are more beautiful people who frequent this store than any other bar\/restaurant\/venue in this city. I've told Rich at Rockhouse Events several times he should figure out how to throw an event here. Every trip I make to this store I curse myself for not wearing make up... and for wearing pajamas.

Also, the guys who work the meat\/seafood counter are all really nice and helpful. 

Overall, a great place if you're hurrying and need something. But if you're looking to stock your pantry and fridge... I recommend leaving the 277 loop.),(In the world of Harris Teeters this one is by far the most expensive. I know this first hand as I used to live just a few blocks away in the 4th ward. And I'm sure that during my first few trips here when I loaded up the (mini) cart full of groceries that locals were probably laughing at me. Oh, silly girl, she doesn't know that this Teeter sports jacked up prices because it's the only grocery store in Uptown. Hardy har har. 

My grocery bills were always astronomical in comparison with similar products at other Teeters...and all other grocery stores for that matter. But, you pay for convenience at this Uptown location. Free parking, too - so that's a nice option. Well, during the past 3.5 years I've learned a few things and now when I'm Uptown and in need of a grocery item I will go here but only for a handful of items. Save money. 

The selection here is a bit limited (as the small is smaller), but the lunch bar isn't too shabby and the staff are pretty friendly. That goes for the rent-a-cop who usually appears near the door, too. If you're scrambling around Uptown and need a bottle of wine, a handful of apples or a frozen pizza - this Teeter fits the bill. Just don't load up your cart and snag your groceries for two weeks like I used to do!),(So another week and another shopping for food...it is great to have a grocery store in the city and one that I can walk to like this location.  Plus, of all the stores (baseline grocery stores...not specialty like Whole Foods, Fresh Market, or Trader Joes) this is my favorite.),(You will notice that...  
This location is more compact than many of the Harris Teeters, and the wine section is noticeably smaller than most of the other HT's.  

I like the way this place is set up.  
You can whiz through grab a few things to complete a meal but I would refrain from picking up things that may not turn over as quickly as other stuff, which leads to my next point.

Do NOT end up making an unfortunate purchase like I did!  
Take no chances on anything that you can't see clearly and are certain is rotated quickly.  I purchased two containers of Gelato that ended up being freezer burnt or either defrosted and refrozen -- not sure.  Ended up being high end trash.   

Service is... 
Quick and the staff is super friendly and courteous.  
I went during off peak hours and parking was plentiful.

Final Note:  Why pay top dollar for items that aren't optimal offerings?  
Be careful what you purchase here.)"

This week I am not traveling and I had no good excuses. I've never been to one of these places (yeah, I know all men say that but it's true or I would have Yelped it) so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.

The club itself is very nicely appointed. Comfortable carpet, lit enough that you can see mostly where you're going. Large wing chairs surrounding a smaller table. Lots of random stage lights, loud dance music and no outside light.

The ladies on the stage start off with clothes on, and then they quickly remove them. They are as naked as Meck County and North Carolina allow them to get. While I managed to snag the seat that wasn't facing the stage directly, there was still a lot of eye candy about, from our bustier and mini-skirt dressed waitress (her name is 'Hollywood') to the dancers (before and after their stage time) asking if we wanted company at our table and the ones who did offer 'company' to some of the tables nearby. The ladies are quite... flexible and... friendly. The lap dances were lengthy and very hands on (above the waist). I have no doubt that the place is completely above board and that there are no 'special deals' going on in the side rooms.

As for the buffet, it was a good deal at $10 plus $3 for an ice tea and $4 to tip the waitress who kept our glasses full and removed dirty plates quickly. A good selection of dinner-type items - beef tips, blackened chicken pasta, meatballs, chicken parmigiana, pork tenderloin. All hearty meaty items. There were some lighter choices, but not many. For dessert, a carved fruit platter, a big plate of handmade cookies, cheesecake and a carrot cake.

I don't see me being here outside of the lunch hours and even then, probably not.),(Please note that this review is for their Wednesday buffet, not the ladies or their gyrations. 

So, a friend and biz associate invited me out to what she quoted as ""the best buffet in Charlotte"" at The Men's Club. Skeptical as I was, I accepted as I love a great buffet. Plus she mentioned that there is a whole wall of desserts and that pretty much sealed the deal. I lunched with two female associates and one male associate. 

The venue: Yup, it's a strip club. All day. These ladies are working hard for their money. However, the space itself is really nice. It's clean, it's pretty, it's, well, almost luxe looking - at least in the semi dark dining area. 

The staff: Our waitresses were nice, efficient and fully clothed. That made digging into the buffet much easier. 

The food: Delicious. Seriously. It's a magical buffet full of so many different types of cuisines. Chef Brian is really nice and he was hanging out by the prime rib - yes, the actual meat - that is not a metaphor for something else. Everything was cooked well and there was enough variety for any palate. Big hits here: mac 'n cheese, asian chicken, perfectly steamed veggies and a nice fresh fruit spread. The dessert section wasn't at large as I thought but it filled the void for my sweet tooth.

Overall: Would I go back? Sure, for the Wednesday buffet. My meal was taken care of by one of my dining partners, but for these 70+ buffet options the cost was $10 per person. If you can stomach viewing a bit of T&A during your lunch, definitely give this stellar buffet a try. Just don't face the stage and make sure to hide your singles.)"

Mrs. had the surf and turf. The shrimp were great and the potatoes were great, but the asparagus was overdone and the steak, while cooked to the requested medium rare, was just not that great a cut.

My first exposure to Green Brothers Juice Co. came back in January when I was researching a Weekly Yelp on juices and smoothies. I immediately fell in love with the place. The man behind GBJ, Josh, is one of those people where you can see the passion for what he does every time you talk to him. I've never seen him not smiling. Do what you love, love what you do.

It can be a little tricky for first timers. When you walk into the Bank of America Plaze, Green Brothers is in the same space where the Energy Cafe it. It's to the right side. This isn't one of those smoothie places that are loaded with sugar. You're putting good stuff in your body here. Not sure what to get? Ask for a recommendation. There are usually samples of some sort as well. 

My favorite thing here is the Cold Busta shot. Any time I start to feel run down or like I may be getting sick, I immediately go here and get one. I swear by it, it's my wellness drug. I pretty much like all the juices and smoothies here. I've tried almost everything here. The Recover Me and the Aww Kale Yeah are both in my rotation. The Recover Me is a good option to ease in to fresh press juices. 

Green Brothers also has juices available by the bottle and you can also order growler size options. Take note of the hydroponics set up they have in the hallway behind the counter. That's right, they're growing some goodness right there for your juice, smoothie, and shot fix.

I'm a huge fan of Josh and Green Brothers and I'm so excited to watch them continue to grow here in Charlotte. Support local!),(For those that don't know, Green Brothers Juice Co. is located at the Bank of America Plaza in a shared space with Energy Cafe, across from the Starbucks and below the Omni Hotel.  Blink and you might miss it.

I've been here several times now, and the smoothies and juices here are outstanding and most definitely beat out the ones at nearby Jamba Juice.  The service here has also been amazing everytime I've been here... in particular one gentleman, which I didn't get his name, who let us sample a ton of juices and was super friendly to us to the point where we complimented him in person!

My favorite smoothie here is the Green Hornet - it's the perfect green smoothie without tasting too ""green"" and has a good salty\/sweet taste.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  Prices are expensive, yes, but reasonable for a fresh, healthy smoothie.  It's the perfect afternoon snack.

They have a frequent buyer's card for those who will be visiting often as well as daily specials.

Will definitely be back often and bringing coworkers with me.)"

There are a lot of restaurant options on the Foodie Call website. However, my choice today was a no-brainer when I saw the Viva Chicken logo. Soup, stuffed avocados and a two liter of Coke. Yes please. My order was just under $30 including delivery fee and tip. Took about an hour. All completely worth it. Seriously, I needed those avocados.

My delivery guy was super nice. He called on the way to the restaurant to let me know his status. He also apologized when he arrived for the delay... even though he was right on time. Super nice.

Make sure to sign up to get special offers, discounts and codes to your inbox.),(When I'm hungry, I'm hungry. And when I'm lazy, I'm lazy. That's why I love Foodie Call. They take care of both of these predicaments and solve them with one successful swoop of delicious restaurant delivery!

Foodie Call is a sweet little delivery service that gives hungry Charlotteans a great smattering of local eateries and menu items to choose from with a click of a button. The website is straightforward and you can easily check out all of the restaurants and their menus online. 

I've ordered from Foodie Call a handful of times and the food always arrives quickly and fresh as can be. I'm a big fan of the variety of restaurant cuisines offered on the site as my tastes and cravings are always a-changin'. Since their inception, Foodie Call has added a bundle of new restaurants to its arsenal, too. Sweet!

As for their service, it's golden - from the order takers to the delivery peeps. One particular night, we selected a menu item that was unfortunately out of stock. Foodie Call was quick to call us back with an apology (not their fault whatsoever), took our new order and brought it to us in no time flat. Super sweet service.

As of now, Foodie Call charges a flat $5 delivery fee and delivers to Uptown, South End, Dilworth, Elizabeth, Myers Park, Sedgefield, and Plaza Midwood. I'm a big proponent of solving problems with a creative solution. Hungry + lazy = make a Foodie Call.)"

Fried cheese sticks: 2\/5: A bit unremarkable overall. The cheese was *fine* and marinara dipping sauce had a nice flavor to it but it was very thin. And two out the six cheese sticks were without cheese. Yep, just fried fakers. 

Garlic cheese bread: 5\/5: Um, hello lover. This little app came out as a tiny cheese pizza pie drizzled with (what I assume to be) garlic oil. It was hot and cheesy and garlicky and damn delicious. 

Margherita pizza: 4.5\/5: Our server recommended this pie and I ordered it with trepidation...I say it that way because margherita pies tend to be pretty bland. But oh no, not this pie. It was packed full of flavor - plenty of pepper, garlic, two types of cheese, fresh tomato and that really perfect crust. My only tiny ish?

I ordered the California chicken salad and really enjoyed it. Lots of great flavors - goat cheese, walnuts, avocado, good greens and the dressing was fantastic. Really impressed with this salad. I'd order it again upon next visit. 

The downsides were the service and my wife's food. She ordered an omelet that had guac and I'm pretty sure the avocados were on their way out. Just a really odd flavor for guac that didn't seem right. We ended up removing most of it from her omelet and everything was fine. Just kind of odd. Also, the service was just a little slow. It was slammed, but our server didn't come back to take our order, refill drinks, or bring the check in a timely manner each time. It took about 10 minutes for him to come back to take our order and around the same each time after that. Not a huge deal, but an hour long brunch for the style that Toast is was a little much.

Maybe not enough cranberry, but I love good cranberry sauce. Sausage gravy (my wife was in a breakfast mood) had a good amount sausage in it.

Granted it appears they have done some remodeling in the front which does give a nice open clean atmosphere on entering, it stops there.

We stopped for lunch today after shopping at Northlake Mall.  The host was not sure of his seating chart and had to physically go and confirm so there was more than a fair measure of confusion here.  He seated us in a booth but apparently no one told our server who did not appear for over 5 minutes going on 10.

She was not very friendly but everyone has an off day.  My wife ordered iced tea and I ordered coffee.  Can't comment on her tea and while Bob Evans Coffee is normally very good and they sell it at the counter, my coffee was extreamely weak and had nothing bold about it.

I expected a open faced turkey sandwich with dressing, mashed potatoes on the side along with the cranberries.

Bob Evans is a very popular family restaurant in the Midwest (they also have several locations in the South like this one in a rural part of Charlotte).  Bob Evans is like a countrified Denny's or IHOP.  Bob Evans is most popular for breakfast, which is available all day.  Their signature breakfast item is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  Their sausage gravy is creamy and filled with sausage.  It is surprisingly spicy--at least when compared to the many gravy and biscuits places out there serving bland white milk gravy with biscuits. 

The sausage gravy at this location definitely delivered the flavor of this popular item at Bob Evans; unfortunately, the sausage gravy could have been a little hotter.  The buttermilk biscuits were similar in quality to what you would get at other Bob Evans locations.  Bob Evans' biscuits have a crunchy top, but they tend to be a tad on the dry side; the sausage gravy helps though. 

I also had their scrambled eggs, which were fine, and their crispy shredded hash browns that were topped with cheese, scallions and bacon.  Their sausage links were good and better than what you get at most chain restaurants or with hotel breakfasts.  While I liked the sausages here, I enjoyed them more when Bob Evans was a smaller chain. 

The French toast was below average.  It was not as sweet as it should have been and had a dense, undesirable center. 

Service was extremely friendly and fitting with the service you get at most Bob Evans locations. 

Prices were very reasonable.  There were several low-cost options and their bigger breakfast combinations were not too expensive and featured generous portions. 

The dining room here was simple but comfortable.  This Bob Evans also has a counter where you can buy packaged treats\/items and Bob Evans syrups, pancake mix and such. 

This Bob Evans is an okay breakfast spot in the rural area outside of Downtown Charlotte.  If you head to Downtown Charlotte though, I am sure that you will find much better, more creative and more local breakfast spots.

First time we went to an Another Broken Egg Cafe was earlier this summer in Vinings Ga when we went down for our Grandson's birthday and baptism.  Enjoyed it and since we were down in the Ballentyne area, decided to give this one a try as well.

Biggest difference between the Vinings locaiton and this one is the level of energy.  Vinings appers to be smaller and more crowded so the servers have to be more fast paced.  This location is bit more spread out and the pace of the service is a bit slower but this would only be a problem if you were on a tight time budget.  That said, it's not slow service but rather, you don't feel quite as rushed.

My wife ordered a Veggie Burger with a side of Fruit. She like both and was particulary pleased that the side of fruit had more than just melons in it.  In Vinings, she had had an omelet that was called a Floridian which looked great so I tired that for breakfast. It's a stuffed omelet with Cream Cheese as one of the filling and it was indeed very good.

The all day menu seems like the no-brainer option here. I ordered hibachi shrimp and zucchini & onions for the sweet carrots. It's 50 cents to swap them.

As is the case with most restaurants, a lot will depend on what you order. So ... I hope I can be of some assistance. 

The Teriyaki Chicken Skewers on the Appetizers menu are awesome. Highly recommended! 

The Japanese Noodles on the Appetizers menu start out tasting a bit bland, but the taste grows on you as you eat. I'm not sure how or why this happened, but those are the facts. Therefore, I recommend the Japanese Noodles. 

The Teriyaki Steak was on the boring side. There wasn't much taste. This dish came with rice and carrots. The rice was good yet not exceptional; the carrots were excellent. 

This place is easy to find, and parking is easy and free if you visit Charlotte on the weekend. The dining area was also spotless. The ""Clean Score"" was 97.5, which means the kitchen is cleaner than most restaurants -- always a good sign. 

The service was friendly and reliable for the most part. The only negative was when we were done; the entire staff was on their phones and not looking up. I had to walk up to the register, but no big deal. This didn't impact the rating. The reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is the borderline tasteless Teriyaki Steak.

Probably 4.5.),(So it was a take out night one recent cold rainy night...

Prices for sushi range between $3 to $4 and no more than $5 for sashimi, which comes with three pieces. The assortment of rolls also generally fall between about $6 and $8. 

But be forewarned: The sizes are relatively small. Still, the menu boasts a nice selection of main, hibachi dishes and sizes, like mixed veggies ($2) and calamari ($5).

The wine list is short, though the Sean Minor Chardonnay was quite nice and perfectly chilled. 

The place has a slight cafeteria feel to it, but the low lighting at night and dark mahogany colored furniture helps. 

The staff are both helpful and cordial. The server twice returned to question my order -- something I appreciated. It's nothing like placing an order and having the chef guess what you meant, then serving you the wrong dish or offering. 

For those dining in, do not get confused by the register and to go counter. Just seat yourself. Honestly, the only aggravation is the music. I did not enjoy listening to Lady Gaga and Rhianna while I was trying to enjoy my spicy scallops and Rainbow Roll. Just not my thing. 

And I was surprised to find that the scallops were served on a dollop of rice. No exaggeration. It was a round bed of rice roughly the size of a half dollar. I thought it would be served as nigiri. Still, the scallops were quite fresh, soft and delicious.)"

My server was Brice and Mr Brice was as good as a server gets! He was right there making sure I had everything and everything was to my liking. And for an airport restaurant most everything was what I expected. My chicken tenders were a bit over done, but I've had much worse - at least they had flavor and a bit of juice inside and the BBQ dipping sauce was probably out of a jar, but still tasty - probably the same stuff I use at home so I really cannot complain there. The french fries were not as hot as I would have liked, but they were not all that bad and it appears they use a good quality ketchup in a bottle and they don't give the customer 10 packs of crap to squeeze! The strawberry ice tea was actually perfect and though there wasn't much cole slaw it was good - could have been colder though.

The place was clean, service was a little slow - had nothing to do with Brice though - I just mean it took awhile to get chicken tenders and fries. If you don't have at least an hour to eat - I'd either ask what can be served quickly or I'd go somewhere else, but that would only be due to time! The price was in line with Airport restaurants. However, I cannot go higher then 3 stars here because of the speed of service AND because for me - they need to turn the music down just a bit and perhaps offer more places to plus in!),(So another trip to see my momma and this was the place to stop off and have 2 beers and 2 shots..........I truly think this is the best way to start off any commerical airline flight....it makes everything seem much better *wink*.

We land at Charlotte for a connection from Miami to San Francisco.  The plane was delayed 15 minutes.  Then 30.  Then an hour.  Then two.  Two turns to six.  I was unhappy.

In rescues Karen from Stock Car Cafe, who reopened the bar for our flight so we can get through an otherwise six hours of nothingness.

Caveat: this place isn't cheap by any standards.  A glass of wine (OK a double) will run you $15.  Multiply that by three.  Yep.

Still, I can't thank Karen enough.),(With a quick layover in Charlotte, I needed a quick place to get some local NC beer. The Untappd app quickly made me realize that there aren't so many spots with craft beer, but I did see that Stock Car Cafe would work just fine.

They had 5 or 6 craft beer options in larger cans, so I asked some fellas at the bar which one to choose. I was amazed by how friendly everyone was at the bar. Maybe it's an airport thing, but people were just starting conversations with random strangers, not even about the sports game on the TV.

It's a little pricey, but this is also an airport bar and restaurant. It was packed on a Friday afternoon. 

The bar area is a little awkward if you don't get a stool, but it's not the end of the world.),(Stopped here before and early flight and sort of regret it.  The waitress was pretty nice, but my food didn't come out quickly. Food wasn't very good or hot for that matter.  My grits were dry and tasteless and the eggs were overlooked.  The egg yolks actually cooked completely through and turned into a tough egg patty. The bacon was pretty good though.  I ordered the Charlotte Special while I would have been better off going with a breakfast sandwich.  I'll try Starbucks next time.)"

I love the chicken gyros. The Greek salad with chicken is usually enough for me to divide in half for two meals. I'm not one who normally orders fries as a side, but I do here. They are just plain stupid good. I can also never stop eating them, even if I'm beyond full. The menu is full of burger, sub, and pita options. There's even falafel, if you're into that kind of thing. Last week, I got the lamb burger special (also, yum I hope this becomes a permanent menu item at some point), a chicken gyro, two orders of fries, and two drinks for around $16. Steal.

Thus, it's a great option for lunch... that is, if you want a delicious, satisfying lunch that may or may not cause a food coma in the afternoon.  Ya might want to pick up one of those 2:30pm coffees.

This little place makes delicious lamb gyros and Greek salads at a reasonable price.  The gyro is fresh and juicy and comes with fries in it, which make it all the more delicious!  The side salad is also a good portion and is reasonably priced.  The salad dressing is great as well.

Very little options around Gateway, but this is probably my favorite place out of all of them.),(I've had better more flavorful chicken gyro's, but for $8, the greek salad\/chicken gyro combo sure beats any combo deal at Subway or Quiznos.

If I wasn't watching what I ate, I'd probably go for the chili cheese fries and a burger - looked amazing. Service quick and friendly, place was clean, seats are limited. Note: they sell these decadent looking brownies too.... 

Accepts Visa\/Mastercard and Cash.),(Went here today for the first time with one of my classmates (he recommended it). It's small, but definitely gets its share of traffic especially at lunchtime. Like I said, it's a pretty small place. You order (most seem to order takeout), there's a drink machine, a couple of tables for 2, and a restroom. But it's clean and the employees there are very friendly.

The food comes out quick and it's delicious. There's a good selection too! burgers, subs, salads, gyros and good sides too. pasta salad, slaw, fries...I had the little village sub and a side order of pasta salad and a soda. The sub was fantastic. It's kind of like their take on a cheesesteak. My friend ordered the gyro (which seems like the most popular lunch item), fries and a drink. He enjoyed his too. The best thing about our meals were that they were delicious, they came out fast, the portions were pretty generous too. (I posted a pic of my meal) AND my meal was under $10.

It's not the place to go if you want to sit and catch up with friends and have a long conversation-filled lunch. But if you're hungry and are looking for a quick, delicious meal to go with fast food prices, here's your place. I'd definitely go there again in a heartbeat!),(What a pleasant surprise. This is strictly food as mine order was to go.  I typically avoid Gyro meat because it's super salty but I needed a quick meal and this place drew me in because they have the option of having a whole wheat wrap so I got the gyro and much to my dismay it's not noticeably salty at all and has amazing flavor.  I got a salad in addition and the chicken on the salad is so tender and flavorful and that it almost didn't even need the dressing definitely will be returning on my next Charlotte visit.)"

They were stuffed with noodles & lettuce and I would get tiny fresh ginger or lemongrass bites.  It really turned me on. That alone was worth the trip and if I were close by, I think I would just pop in for a little snack.

I also ordered vermicelli with pork, shrimp and spring roll and a vietnamese coffee.  Our tab was $33 for two.  So it isn't exactly cheap for lunch, but worth it and worth the drive to go try it.

Wine and beer available (after 12:00 of course) or just go with the coffee or Pepsi products. Service is good at refilling drinks and clearing dirty plates.

Enjoy!),(Equal parts old-fashioned soda shop, restaurant, bar, and hangout. The location is absolutely crucial here. Located in one of the more walkable parts of South End, Pike's is a gem with a hefty menu complete with plenty of sweets and southern treats.

Haven't been to Pike's in quite some time and this was my first go for lunch. Decided to dine al fresco and enjoyed every second of it. This time 'round, didn't go for anything on the sweet side of things, but rather went for the lunch menu solely. 

Started with the mozzarella sticks. Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren't the ""out of the bag"" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren't covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.

Went with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it's straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I'm usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic. It acted as a nice residual dipping sauce for the remaining chips. 

Service was friendly, outside was perfect for the present weather, prices are fair, walkability is always a plus.

Today I decided to drop in, it was close to three, it is very cute, like an old fashion soda shop (that is a little revamped), a huge drug store clock where it's always ten till eight and cute little memorabilia around. 

You may be asking, well Tonya, why the five stars? Let's start. 
First of all my french fry barometer scored it a 'yahoooooo' for my scorched fingertips from the hot fries. I ordered a hot dog with raw onion, jalapeno and yellow mustard. My hot dog was made with love, the condiments went to both ends of the dog, not just in the middle and what really made me happy, the simple act of sprinkling salt and pepper on my fries before serving. I can tell, whoever was in the kitchen, prepared my lunch with love. 

I also saw a Coca-Cola float go out with Mexican bottled Coke. Can I get a hell yeah? Sorry I was so harsh and judgmental.),(I love this place. Friends of ours recommended this spot when they stumbled upon it during the DNC weekend. Sadly we waited until tonight to give it a try. Big mistake on our part...(for waiting so long to try it).

We were entertaining out of town family and wanted to give them a taste of Charlotte. Ironically we were at the ""taste of Charlotte"" event earlier in the day. But I digress. 

We walk into Pikes for dinner and it really does have that old school soda shop\/diner vibe. The menu has some great home style dishes and typical southern appetizers, along with plenty of options for milkshakes, malts and floats.

I had the pecan fried chicken. It was atop the entrees listed on the menu. I love pecans. I love fried chicken. It was a great combination. It was delicious and a good sized portion. It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole. I subbed in fries. 

I also had a fresh orangeade and for dessert a root beer flavored milkshake. I was very impressed and can't wait to go back. The service was good and the prices were very reasonable. They also have daily specials and brunch on Sundays, both of which were very intriguing. 

It's a fun and casual place and very reasonably priced. I look forward to my next visit and definitely recommend for folks to give it a try.),(So, while on a mini getaway with my husband to Charlotte, Sunday morning we decided to go to brunch buffet before heading back to Atlanta. We both saw this restaurant on websites and Yelp so we decided to give it a go.

The display was cool - a little janky because some of the dishes holding the food were broken or hard to get into.. One or two didn't even have covers because they were off to the side ripped off. Wretched, I know! Nonetheless, there weren't many people so the food was abundant.

First round I tried the scrambled eggs, coffee cake, bacon, hash brown casserole, grits and a ham on an English muffin with a poached egg  (forgot what these are called because I normally don't eat it - but as soon as I was typing it.. Something benedict came to mind lol). These were all pretty darn good. I really enjoyed the casserole. It was nice and cheesy. I got some as soon as it came out so it was best fresh.

Second time around, I went and got a few different things.. This time I got some warm apples and a biscuit with gravy. The gravy was pretty bland but the biscuit was fluffy. Catch 22! 

I wouldn't come here again because there are so many places to eat in Charlotte but this spot does have that old soda shop feel, so I'd recommend it for the experience.)"

This restaurant is not far from the Four Points Hotel and they recommended it since everything else had long closed except for the strip joints and the 24 hour Skyland Family Restaurant. I really did not care, I was just so starved and needed FOOD!

I walked the couple minute trek and found the restaurant easily. The sidewalk was clear and there was actually business at this time of the morning. It was hard to get a vibe for the area since everything was dark, but there were other businesses within sight. I walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a woman who seated me at a booth. Not long after a male waiter came by and offered coffee, water and a menu. Within what seems seconds drinks were on the table. The coffee was solid.

When the waiter came back with drinks I took no time to let him know that I was exhausted and just needed to eat, but preferred breakfast and asked for a recommendation. Some sort of combo with eggs, meat, another side and pancakes were offered. I decided on sausage patties and grits to accompany the meal. The waiter was friendly and it was refreshing after a really bad day at the airport.

I took a look around the dining room and it was set up with booths on the exterior walls. and interior middle. Seating capacity was pretty good and from what I could see it was tidy. There were various wall hangings which made it feel more comfortable. It was a standard diner place I guess, I was too tired to remember more details. 

My breakfast came out so fast I thought it had to be a mistake and someone elses. But oh no, they rushed it through because I said how hungry I was and boy was it appreciated. The food smelled great and I was ready to dig in, but which first. Well I hit up the grits off the bat, something I don't often order. They were delicious, but so was everything and temperature was nice and hot.  My waiter checked up on me twice and provided a coffee refill.

My area was cleared quickly of dirty dishes upon finishing and the check was in hand to check out. I found the bill to be almost a mistake, it was so reasonable for the amount of food. The woman up front when paying was also friendly and we chatted a few minutes about all the wrestling memorabillia on the wall. The owner is a HUGE fan of wrestling. So, if anyone wants to talk wrestling come in during the day and he will bend your ear off I imagine. 

I have no idea about the rest of the menu, but my meal was definitely quality. The service was about as good as you could possibly get. The place was clean and they offer 24 hour dining which was a bonus for me. I can imagine there lunch and dinner meals are pretty darn good too! The pies in the case as I headed out looked yum.

I chose a side of mixed greens instead of chips and was served a mighty large side of salad. The sammie and greens were flavorful and definitely enough to fill me up. 

Dolce Vita is a great place to take a load off and chill with friends. You can also buy bottles to go, too! I believe they charge 50% of the list price.),(So before I moved to the mountains I decided to try this place one more time....without the crazy X......and it was a lot more fun.

I continue to find the staff on the ball here and selection continues to change.

It was great to try this place one more time.......without the drama of basket droppers.)"

This is the good sh... stuff. Thin crust, large sized slices that are bigger than the 9 inch paper plate. The kind that you have to fold in half and still support because the ""spine"" isn't strong enough by itself. Cheezy, drippy, goodness.

I'm told that they also have a great cheese steak and there are some other cooked items. I wouldn't know. For me, it's all about the pie.),(Le sigh. I miss the Luigi's that used to be in Dilworth, right next to the Teeter on East Blvd. I miss their giant, cheesy slices with just the right amount of grease and crispity crunchity crust. When Luigi's left their spot in Dilworth, I think I shed at least a few tears. But alas, here's how it went down last weekend when we were driving around Steele Creek...

Hubs: ""So, you're hungry, right - what are you in the mood for?""
Me: ""Mmm, I don't know. Something quick would probably be best.""
Hubs: ""K, how about Chick-Fil-A?""
Me: ""Ehhh, no. I'd love a big ole slice of pizza. Let me get out my Yelp app.""
Me: ""Stop the car, I see Luigi's! Done. Pizza. Thanks.""

I popped right in, grabbed a slice o' cheese to go for $2.25, a cup for water and stuffed my face while we made our way back north. 

A few things to note about this location:

1) There is quite a bit of seating, and naturally, kiddos love pizza. Lots of seats, lots of pizza, lots of kids. Just sayin'. 
2) If you want a side of anything with your 'za (ranch, marinara, etc.) expect to pay for it. Literally. A side of ranch (requested by another patron) was $.50. While I understand the need to cover costs, it seems a bit silly (until people start abusing it, I suppose). 
3) Don't even think about trying to scam soda into your water cup. You shouldn't be doing it anyway (just buy the damn soda if you want one), but there is a big, bright sign that threatens back payment if the Luigi's staff sees soda in your clear cup. Again - a bit of overkill, but I get it. 

Luigi's - please come back to Dilworth or South End or somewhere closer to Uptown so I can further stuff my face with your delicious slices!)"

It was an excellent choice and I have to double recommend the warm goat cheese and mascarpone dip to start. Excellent, excellent, excellent!

I had the ricotta with meat sauce as my main. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent. I asked for the added scoop of ricotta cheese but it really wasn't necessary with the freshly grated cheese on top. Lots of pasta, it went home in a box and was a full lunch meal the next day.

My wife chose the pork chop special, which was served with sliced apple in a delicious sweet gravy. Absolutely excellent and again, more than enough to take home.

Service was excellent and the food was excellent. I'm sure we'll be back!),(You know my rule- if Frank Scibelli's name is on it, it's going to be delicious. 

The Warm Goat Cheese & Mascarpone appetizer is a must for a group. I also love the house made mozzarella and tomatoes. Their Chopped Salad is one of my favorites. I like to get that with a soup. Big fan of the meatballs. They are made with turkey, ricotta, and prosciutto. Delicious. My buddy Fritz always gets their lasagna. 

I like this place because it's pretty versatile. You can take your family, a date, do a girls' night, grab drinks, etc. They have a nice little bar area and their new patio is fantastic. 

Service is always is great. Super friendly staff. Thank you Mama's for being such a consistent go to spot.),(Mama Ricotta's is like a nice warm blankie in the winter: comforting, familiar and shareable. I've stopped by Mama Ricotta's many a time and, frankly, it's always been at least a good if not great meal. The service has always been friendly (especially in the bar for some reason) and even when things haven't gone perfectly, they have always offered to make it right. Big points here. 

Since I've been here so many times, here is a rundown of a few of my personal favorites:

Goat cheese & marscapone dip: Exactly the nom-ness you would expect. Warm creamy dip topped with tasty tomato sauce and served with grilled crostini.

Pasta Primavera: Pretty basic, but a light and colorful veggie angel hair dish. I've only ordered this with the EVOO sauce but I'm always adding extra spice to give it a kick.  

Butternut squash ravioli: There is a fancier name to this in house, but you'll see what I mean. Delicious, tender butternut squash raviolis with an orange creame sauce, bits of proscuitto, walnuts and sage. It's ass  on a plate and it's amazing.

It's been a while since I've had dessert here, so I really can't comment on that. However, I have been here for brunch and it was asi asi...but really, Mama, you'll know I'll be coming back. Solid resto, solid food and solid service.),(I was back here a little while ago as a friend loves the place and though I can think of several other Italian places I like better, I do like the folks and the food here.

These guys are trying to embrace a dying breed of ""diner-style"" eats with the combo of the classic bakery alongside the diner burgers, fries, swing-style soda shoppe atmosphere and include a full bar. I grew up with Fuddruckers and Big View is definitely reminiscent. 

The food is mediocre. Nothing too out of the ordinary. I tried the Hickory BBQ Burger - standard applewood smoked bacon, onion straws, and bbq sauce. Nothing like I haven't had before. Definitely reliable when in a burger frenzy or in a pinch for something familiar. 

What I will say sings foreground for these guys is the bakery. Goodness gracious is it awesome that you can get a gigantic, NY-stle b&w cookie here. The milkshakes (coffee and chocolate has been my favorite thus far) are wonderful. They have tons of cakes, pies, cookies, and so on. The best part is that they are all in the classic display case and a nice glass window so you can see into the kitchen. These guys may not be a 5-star French bakery, but they are cranking out some American favorites that have yet to be less than spectacular, in my opinion. Definitely worth the pilgrimage for dessert. 

The interior is pretty big, too. Tons of booth seating, which is always a favorite, bar stools, tables, and a cozy waiting area. 

Though these guys are laid pretty far off of 521 outside of Ballantyne, it's worth the novelty of checking it out.),(We decided to continue our celebrating here and overall it ws good.  We both had the crispy fried shrimp  and just a heads up, the bread coating is on the heavy side and it is really crunchy.   Knowing this i probably won't order again as i like my batter to be lighter.  The side of grits and onion rings were very good.  We wrapped it up with the coconut cake which for me really pushed it overall to the 4 stars.),(Hubs and I checked this place out for a casual lunch during the work week. It's pretty impressive from the outside - a massivo diner that looks like a '60s diner on steroids. 

Inside, it's nicely laid out with a large cocktail bar up front and a long sit 'n eat bar on the side. We had to wait a few minutes for a table on a Tuesday afternoon (which was a bit odd) but were pleasantly greeted and seated in no time. As for the menu - it's pretty extensive. There are quite a few options that will likely satisfy a variety of palettes. I went with the grilled chicken and veggie sandwich and hubs chose the Reuben. 

Overall, the food was good but nothing spectacular. My sammie was pretty tasty - the veggies were grilled, albeit a bit soggy, and the chicken was tender. I tried a few of hubs' fries and they were pretty good - thicker cut fries with the right amount of salt. I just wish they were crispier. 

It's a decent spot to stop for a lunch...I'll give it another go with a different menu item. I also really want to try their shakes and desserts!),(We've been to the Big View Diner before but normally later in the day.  Have an early Dr. Appointment so we were out earlier than normal. 

We walked in a few minutes after 8am and they were already busy.  Hostess immediately seated up and brought us menus and took our coffee orders.

She was back in a couple minutes with two cups of outstanding fresh brewed coffee and asked if we has made up our minds on Breakfast.

My wife order Crab Cake Benedict with a side of fruit. Been awhile since I have had Lox and Bagels so the fresh salmon bagel with cream cheese, tomato, onion, and capers sounded close enough

While we waited we reviewed the room. Lots of glass and dark wood, very modern design. It's a good restaurant and has a great fresh bakery section.

By this time our breakfast had arrived.  Serving portions are large and probably explains why I need to loose about 10 extra pounds.

My wife enjoyed her Crab Cake Benedict. Fruit was good and was a lot more than just cheap melon that some restaurants serve. The Benedict's were large and very flaky with a lot of crab and very little filler. They were very large and my wife ended up taking one home for later.

The Salmon and Bagel was excellent. Salmon had a nice fresh taste. The tomatoes tasted like a tomato should and the capers were a nice contrast.

In the end, a very enjoyable meal and we would come here more often except for the commute from Lake Norman is about 30 miles. She's already hitting me up to come down for the lunch menu so she can get the Veal Meatloaf.)"

I used to frequent the Zink Uptown location for a stacked brunch and was looking forward to checking out their new-ish location in SouthPark for an equally tasty meal. Inside, Zink hasn't changed much since M5 (still modern, clean and dark) but the menu has. It's a combo of American comfort food and modern twists on the classics. For brunch, their bloody mary menu is incredibly impressive - with creative mixes like bacon, jalapeno and even scotch. It's definitely worth a peruse through! 

For my meal, I choose the pancake of the day - the strawberry pancake. Our server mentioned how much she enjoyed these pancakes, covered with strawberries, heavy whipped cream. Ok sure. I want that please, with a side of smoked bacon. The pancakes were small, but delightful, fluffy little spheres of tasty. My main issue with this dish? I had five small hunks of strawberries on top. I love strawberries - that's why I ordered this dish...I simply wanted more! The cream was nice and a perfect addition, however, I would have preferred it on the side as it was mostly melted and slid off my pancakes when the plate was set down in front of me. The side of bacon, which was a steal for $2.50, came with four slices of peppery, smoked, crispy bacon. It was damn good bacon. 

I'll definitely come back to Zink - they've crafted a good looking menu in a well positioned restaurant. Maybe next time I'll grab a seat on their fab patio!),(Zink is the new M5.

I thought that was interesting and I asked my server what he liked on the menu and he liked the idea of a small salad and a choice of entree. So I decided with the BLT & tomato soup. 

Service was good, the food is top quality, but the reason for only three stars is because they served refrigerator cold tomatoes on a BLT. Really? A restaurant with chefs has tomatoes in the fridge?  They should be ashamed of themselves.

I always have fun when I pop in to The River. A lot of staff members have been here a long time, so I always see a familiar face behind the bar. Tuesday is college night.

Sure it was a game night so the place was packed but they were also properly staffed with servers, bartenders and I'd think cooks.

Inside, Wolfman is a pretty standard, but comfy, pizza joint. The booths are roomy and it smells like divine pizza. The staff has always been super friendly, seating hubs and I at a booth to our liking and quickly getting us set up with drinks and menus. I'm a fan of speedy service!

And the menu - Wolfman is full of creative pies - just like Ted M. said. My personal faves are White Wolf and the Veg-o-Matic. The White Wolf is a white pie - no red sauce, but instead piled high with various cheeses, garlic and other goodies. This particular pie can be a little greasy for my liking, but it's nothing that a paper towel can't remedy. Yes, I'm that girl.

The Veg-o-Matic is just what you would think, a pizza stacked with plenty of veggies. It should also be noted that just about everything at Wolfman is made in house - i.e. they don't use canned pizza sauce, pineapple, etc. 

Price wise, Wolfman is pretty average, almost affordable, if you're not a big eater. Pizza always makes the best leftovers!

The chicken tamale left a lot to be desired - it was like the sad, squishy cousin of the fried corn tamale. I'll skip the chicken tamale next time.

The key thing here folks keep bringing up about this place is it's run by or staffed by some Johnson & Wales students (cooking \/ hospitality school in Charlotte).
Located in the center of the city in Founder's Hall (Bank of America) on the 3rd Floor.  It is a bit tricky to find it if you haven't been in that building.

Design, layout, and décor is ultra modern and minimal.  They have several key food areas...food bars where you pick a baseline dish\/pasta\/sandwich\/salad\/item, then add onto it as you like based on the extras they have that particular day.  They also stock a good supply of side items.

I had the mixed greens salad with chicken and light dressing....and it was very good....even better than Dean and Deluca's....which is saying something!

FREEBIE ALERT:  They have free water in carry out cups...after you go through the cash register, so save a few bucks and pick it up instead.

The food was served quick, but the plastic container my salad came in was so tightly sealed I had to tear the plastic to get it off....needless to say had I not taken care to do so, it would have exploded all over the place.  

In addition, they have a sweets area that does a special on Tuesday where you get a free cup cake when you buy three.....not sure if that is a hit here, but in Chicago?!?!?!  Look out...they ladies would have loved it up there!

Pricing was in-line, if not a bit more expensive than Dean and Deluca which was disappointing.  Finding good, healthy, and cheap lunch alternatives in the center city continues to be a challenge for me.  At $8 to $9 a day...that adds up to over $2000 annually....ouch!

Finally, they'd gotten 5 stars, but they're trash set up wasn't done very well as they tried to provide several options as it pertains to recycling, but the wording on the cans and how close the landfill trash can and recyclable trash can are together it was just a jumbled mess of trash?????  Add in the armoured car like salad container and they lost one star :^(

But Taste is a winner in my book.  Tucked away as it is, it does serve up some good fresh food.)"

The service, must like Flemings (the restaurant I loved down the block), is fantastic.

Excellent training and people who genuinely seemed interested in working with you to make sure you are satisfied.

It's probably the only reason I gave this a four instead of three when thinking of having to balance.

Why? Well, I'm from New York... home of more Italians than most of the rest of the world. This means that I'm a bit pickier about Italian food.

So, while the food isnt bad or anything, it just isnt amazing. I'd expect more from a place that looks and acts this good.

Would I eat here again? Maybe. I'd prefer Flemings any day, though.),(I've always walked around Founder's Hall and seen the signs that adverise Aria's express lunch special.  My team and I were looking for a quick sit down lunch somewhere near the office, so we decided to stop by Aria, where there was no wait to be found (on the upstairs level).  We were seated and accommodated quickly by a nice waitress.

The express lunch is 3 courses - appetizer, main, and cheesecake and there's really not that many options to choose from.  If you're a vegetarian, you basically only have a choice of penne vodka for your main dish.  The express lunch comes served on a plate that is basically like a fancy ceramic bento box.  As for myself, I chose the roasted tomato bisque to start which was semi-warm, but had a pretty good flavor.  This might be a bit diva-like, but I thought having soup out of a square shaped bowl was weird.  The soup was probably the best out of the rest of the dishes in all honesty.  For my main, I got the Orecchiette with Sausage.... its not a red sauce-based dish, but rather oil and garlic.  It had a lot of flavor to it, but I'm not really a fan of oil-based pastas.  The serving size was just perfect.  Everyone raved about the cheesecake but I really was not a huge fan of it.  To each their own.

If you like basic Italian food and are looking for a quick, cheap, sit down meal in the Bank of America Corporate Center, 1BAC, or Founder's Hall, Aria is a good choice for convenience and value.  However, I think there are much better choices for lunch out there.),(The decor is nice (like every other restaurant in Uptown), but the service is abominable. More importantly, the food here is just not good. 

Short rib appetizer: extremely small, decent tasting, but a whopping $9 ($5 at the bar if it is happy hour).

Duck Pappardelle: Too much noodle, not enough duck. Duck was very fatty and tasteless. Plus, they don't use fresh pasta! $15.

Osso Bucco: Tender pork roast with NO flavor at all. $25.

Veal Scallopini: Aria's specialty. Tastes like it's from Olive Garden.

Tiramisu: Decent and decently priced at $6.

Overall, the highlights were the bread and tiramisu, but they weren't life changing. For the price you pay and the terribly slow and unfriendly service, it's not worth it.),(All I have to say is plum tomato & Sambuca mussels.),(I am upping the stars on this place only due to Jennifer G the server that has consistently made me want to come back here.

I avoid the bar at all costs, but in the dining room and with Jennifer as our server it can be a great place to dine.

For this evening it was people close to me.   5 of us sat down at a table and Jennifer took care of the rest...suggesting wines...pairing them with food, etc.

I had the Lasagna...others had chicken and pork and the list goes on.

Lots of food - so well worth the price, though wine here can run above $16 a glass????),(We had a lunch business meeting here using their upstairs meeting room.

The lunch was a buffet style lunch. The food was very delicious and the servers were friendly, helpful, and professional.

NOTE: A word of warning about using their meeting space. There is an entrance to the restaurant from the commons area of the Bank of America Corporate Center building in which Aria is located. The restaurant either cannot or won't close off this entrance during business hours. Thus - we had a constant annoying stream of people coming and going to the restaurant during our presentations - some of them talking loudly as they came up the stairs to exit the restaurant.

Secondly, the upstairs room IS NOT isolated from the rest of the restaurant - the stairway and some open space allow a lot of noise to filter upstairs. The second presenter had to move away from the podium right up to the group so that he could be heard (microphone was not working).

I'm not going to ding Aria about the meeting space issues as I had no hand in booking the space. Had I made the arrangements for the space and then had this happen, I would have dinged them a couple extra stars.),(This new addition to Charlotte did a great job in exceeding our expectations on a recent snowy night.   Aria serves Tuscan food in a contemporary environment, and I loved that the open bar with live music that kept us entertained for most of the night. 

We had a reservation at 9 on a Friday night. Good thing- as this place was packed! The restaurant is below street level so we were able to peek in as we walked along the sidewalk to gauge where we wanted to sit before walking in. 

Upon entering the front door, you are in a vibrant bar with a wall of wine from floor to ceiling. Glancing around, the open kitchen is the next thing to catch your eye and then you spy the seating area as the tables are filled with animated people all enjoying their food while listening to the live guitar music. I could have sat in the bar all night- but dinner was our goal! 

We were seated immediately and began to look at the menu. Our server, Carolyn was great! She knew the menu inside and out and was able to make some great suggestions for us. And the patrons were friendly too, as we struck up a conversation with the couple next to us within minutes of sitting down (but that's another story for another time) 

We began with the tuna carpaccio and the antipasto plate. The tuna came with asparagus and was terrific, and the antipasto? Gone in an instant but not before enjoying the salami, olives and cheeses. 

We decided to split a pasta and and a couple of entrees so that we could taste a larger range of the menu. The penne pasta with ricotta and vodka tomato cream sauce was perfection on a plate (would it have been wrong of me to lick the dish?). And the lamb chops were so good I didn't want to share them so my friend enjoyed his veal scallopini in peace.

Dinner for two with drinks and wine came to about $130 which was great considering the quality of the food and the quantity of the drinks that we had. It was a great night out and the service was spot on. We walked to the restaurant but if you are driving- they do have complimentary valet parking and also validate for the Bank of America parking garage. 

Aria may be a new addition to Charlotte- but they have none of the new restaurant blues that so many places experience. Unless, of course you count the blues being played in the lounge, but on the night we were here- those were just the kind of blues we wanted to hear!),(I was here for a work dinner and this is one of those places that get's the uptown post work ""business"" crowd. 

Decent amount of menu options and a very extensive wine list and some beer choices. 
I got the had the salmon with mashed potatoes dishes, tasty stuff.

We walked in a little carry out space with a couple of high top tables, looked like take out,  the lady had a steam table loaded with 8 dishes, it's kind of like buffet, but Terry fixes your plate. (I used to work with a waiter from NY, when Southerners said, ""fixin"", he would say, ""is it broken?"")   She loads it up with all the veggie dishes, there were one or two meat options too.  I didn't try any, now I'm mad at myself, why didn't I?  Plenty of injera and Terry's homemade hot sauce available. The door to the bar is open, so you can sit in the bar with your heaping plate of goodness, there's even a patio if you would like to sit outside, but not a lot of shade so it would have to be the perfect afternoon for al fresco dining.

We enjoyed our lunch, barely talking, scarfing down our food, Ethiopian is one thing that I cannot eat fast enough!!!  If I'm with people, I have to make myself stop and talk. 

Be sure to make time for coffee service.  Ethiopian coffee is unique.  They hand roast the beans, grind them, steep in a tiny, clay pot and serve with warm milk, tiny cups and popcorn. WHAT THE WHAT?  My head exploded.  I had a most enjoyable lunch, can't wait to return!

After sitting for 15min at a fairly empty bar & being passed by both bartenders multiple times finally one acknowledged me. I ordered my regular, vodka soda in a tall glass. She asked if I wanted a double, I said sure. I gave her my card with the order as I tend to do. She brought the drink (in a plastic cup?) with my CC slip....she charged me $18! For house vodka!

I asked the other bartender about it and I recognized his attitude from when I was a bartender (10+yrs). He acted like I was a bitchy customer. He said he'd make me a single & that she was doing her job by ""upselling."" I understand the word ""double"" was said but usually it's not even mentioned when it's actually twice the price. 3 Stars bc the food is actually decent granted I'm not sure how expensive bc the Comedy Zone covered it.

I had the pleasure of visiting the NoDa location when they had first opened and I must say that it has only improved. The Goldstein family is so friendly and always willing to get to know you. The way they run a small business is so personal and welcoming. I love walking in and striking up a conversation with Mishie or Debbie. 

It's such a quaint little shop. Lots of local art on the walls, a few seats, some beverages and Tasty Yo swag available for purchase. 

The yogurt is incredible. Definitely the best blend\/brand of frozen yogurt I've had to date. The flavors are great and they change throughout the week so make sure you check their site, Facebook, Twitter, etc. to find out which flavor is available when you go. You really can't beat the original tart flavor. Perfectly sweet and tart and perfect for loading on the toppings. 

The toppings are prepped with precision. All of the fruit (pineapple, mango, strawberries, kiwi) are cut into perfect pieces to be placed on your Yo. Not in big chunks like Yoforia and Pinkberry. 

Also, the granola is the best I've ever had. Homemade in a commercial kitchen in town and spiced to perfection. 

Definitely try it with apple sauce and sweetened condensed milk. Tastes just like apple pie. Scout's honor. 

The prices are very reasonable compared to other places as well. Small is $3.50, Medium $4.50 and Large is $5 and you get 3 toppings on each. It's a steal. 

All of the combos can keep you coming back all summer long. Great to have in the shop or have whilst walking around a Gallery Crawl night. Pints to go are always a joy. Grab em on Wednesdays and they are buy one, get one half off!

The best yogurt in the Queen City for sure.),(I'm really impressed. I'm also a bit ashamed I haven't been in to Tasty Yo and indulged before! Yes, I've had their delightful frozen yogurt at a variety of events, but I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try it in store! 

I went with the cappuccino - um, yum. Super fresh, not saccharine-y sweet and a perfect mix of smooth espresso and creamy, cool yogurt. The size small was plenty for me and for my three toppings, I chose strawberries, Oreos and coconut. Hungry yet? For $3 and change, that treat was a dessert worth noting. 

The flavors change daily and the toppings are plentiful and fresh. The shop is full of bright whites and greens with a smattering of chairs to grab a seat while you enjoy. Get yourself some Tasty, yo.),(Take that- I am changing my rating of four stars to 5 big ones.  Tasty Yo is a great local business, they are so nice when you go in there.  I am totally addicted to Fruity Pebbles.  Hey, thanks Tasty Yo.),(The employees at Tasty Yo are great, but the quality of the yogurt here is average at best.  They offer only one flavor, original tart.  So basically, you come here to get tart yogurt, choose your size (small to parfait, $3.00 to $6.50, I believe), and then choose your three toppings (liquid toppings free).  The toppings seemed a bit limited and they did not really offer any cool or special toppings, like mochi, for instance.

The interior of the store is small, wooden, and narrow.  Tasty Yo reminds me a lot of Yogurt Tap in Decatur, GA both in its design and quality of yogurt and toppings.  It's got a more humble, down-to-earth feel than the usual modern and chic-looking froyo shops (e.g. Yoforia).  Good, honest effort, but Tasty Yo is still a notch below froyo shops I frequent in Atlanta (Pinkberry, Yoforia, and Yogurberry).)"

I've just never had an opportunity to eat here until I had some friends staying in Uptown and they wanted a ""Charlotte meal"". So here's to Mert's and one less bookmark!

Classic Southern soul food. Collard greens and fried okra and fried chicken and sausage gravy and all those yummy things that just put weight on when you mention their names! I was tempted by so much but when the waiter mentioned their specials, I knew that the grilled pork chop in white gravy was for me. And it was. Excellent and tasty with lots of flavor and spice, I cleaned the plate and then picked up the bone for chewing. Great stuff. For sides, I had the mac & cheese (excellent!) and the yams (only meh).

For dessert, the peach cobbler was only okay - an overwheming spiciness. I think that I might have just gotten a bad scoop, because my friend who had it really liked his. The vanilla ice cream gave it the right consistency, but the flavor wasn't right.

Street parking only, but it's barely a stone's throw from the LYNX Station so consider taking the train!),(Mert's is one of those go-to, Charlotte staple, consistently filling, always busy, and good-luck-finding-a-seat kind of spots you can't miss if you're a regular diner around town. Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days. 

Where I'm not a huge soul\/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go. 

One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any ""peak"" hour. 

Service is ever-so friendly and I love the ""shoe art(?)"" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it. 

Mert's, thank you. Just...for everything.),(Great place for lunch when you're craving soul food in the Queen City.

I came here with a coworker for lunch, and had the fried shrimp po boy and macaroni and cheese.  Runs for about $7ish dollars.  The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special, and the po boy was exactly what you would expect it to be.  The cornbread is good, but for some reason I still prefer Boston Market's..... ha.

All in all it was a satisfying lunch, but nothing that I would go crazy over.),(Oooh I loves me some Mert's! When I worked downtown this place was a regular on my list of favorite lunch spots. You can smell it a block away! Amidst all the new fine dining places Charlotte has to offer is this little gem of home cooked greasy goodness.

It's hard to recommend any one thing in particular, because I've had almost the entire menu...but I guess my favorite meal had to be the blackened pork chops with some yams, charleston red rice and sauteed squash on the side. It's the kind of lick your lips food that makes you forget it's going to be a long day on the treadmill tomorrow. The fried chicken is also fantastic, as is the shrimp po'boy.

The owners here are so friendly, and you often see various members of the family working the registers or serving tables. They talk to all the patrons like they're newly inducted members of the family, and make it a very fun, comfortable atmosphere to eat some great food in. We've also used them for catering several times and they stole the from some of Charlotte's biggest names.),(Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch?....to Carol K's review...which I was dining with at the time...we had a nice little brunch at this Charlotte landmark eatery.  The food is good hearty downhome southern food (long live the south) and we made the most of it.

The service staff never missed a beat and kept us happy and well stocked on whatever we needed.

Throwing in a few drinks made it not a cheap brunch, but definitely a good one!),(I enjoyed my experience at Mert's. Having a soul food restaurant in Uptown really shows the variety of options. Again, with friends we visited and the place was packed. It's not the largest restaurant, but it has lots of charm. The place had photos all over the wall and some interesting art too. I was mostly taken by the counter of cakes. They had at least 10 on the counter for you to choose from. I picked out the cake I wanted before I ordered my food. I had the fried catfish, black eyed peas, cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. I enjoyed everything except the macaroni and cheese. I also had cornbread, which was great. I had to stop eating it before my food came out or I would have been full. Ok, the best part of it all was the Banana Pudding Cake. Initially, I wanted the Banana Pudding, but they were out, so the next best thing is Banana Pudding Cake. It was highly recommended from our waitress and it didn't disappoint. It's a must try. All the cakes looked delicious. The food is reasonably priced too. The restaurant is in the city, so parking is available in different lots or garages and you can walk. Overall, I enjoyed it!),(I would say I enjoyed every bite here, but that would be an ""alternative fact."" 

I haven't seen my friend from upstate New York for almost 7 years, and when she told me she was going to be in Charlotte, I was so excited I forget to look up Mert's menu ahead of time online. Usually I need a preview, so I got there few minutes early, to buy some time to consider my options. Food for thoughts, right?

Whether you're craving some Barbecue Ribs or a large bowl of Shrimp Creole and Catfish, 
Mert's Heart & Soul is where you'd find it. I had the Beef BBQ Ribs with okra and MacNCheese and didn't fall in love with it.

Three and Half Yelps),(What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city. 

We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu. 

Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me. 

But I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better. 

Robin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just ""had to try"" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance. 

This is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte.),(Soul food that make your heart smile. 

Every time i visit da south for work I get excited about new bbq and soul food spots that I get to try. This place alone made my trip worth while. 

Had the jumbo wings with mac and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread.Everything was delicious and had a unique touch. The collard greens were the best I've ever had.

The selection and customer service here was outstanding. They even have a phone app, how cool right ?

Can't wait to come back and get me some more Mert's.),(Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned... 

Let me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  

First let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. 

Let's break down the meal.

Fried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. 

Collard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.

Mac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce\/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. 

Here we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!

What in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.

Here's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  

Like many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends.),(Oh man. When people talk about legit southern food, I will think of this place fondly. I will actually probably think of it and drool. 

I ordered the special turkey dinner, with greens and Mac n' cheese. I didn't even realize the turkey had stuffing in it! Both were incredible! I also absolutely loved the greens and Mac. Honestly, I wish I had a bottomless stomach so I could have eaten it all. One thing's for sure, and it's that you will not leave hungry!),(Last year I remembered that this place had a line out the door. We waited last year and we waited this year too. Why? Because Mert's is worth it! 

We were lined up outside for about 20 minutes this time, but found entertainment in a street hustle, where some character asks to see if you have a 100 dollar bill and if so he invites you to bet it by guessing which of 3 bottle caps has a red pill underneath. I was so glad to get in when we did, really not trying to get caught up in a street brawl just in case both that red pill and main man's 100 dollar bill disappeared all at once. 

So we're seated. I ordered a sweet tea, collard greens, mac n cheese, fried catfish, and BBQ beef riblets. Sounds like alot, but the portions are equivalent to a plate of food at a cook out. Nonetheless I was stuffed! The collard greens are excellent, you can taste a little vinegar and they top them with tomato and onion if you don't protest. I enjoyed everything, mac n cheese thick n cheesy, ribs-tender sauce -sweet, the catfish was good n crisp, however I like a slightly spicier batter. But other than that, two thumbs up!! 

The surroundings are pleasant, you see lots of young people laughing and having fun, and proud accomplished HBCU alumni telling their stories around the table! An American dream, the culture here is so rich. This place is worthy of a visit from one of those Food Network Road Scholars for sure! Totally SATISFYING; where else can 5 grown ups eat for $80? If yall don't know you better ask somebody :0) Mert's is all that!),(Awesome fried chicken.

I really wanted to go to Price's but since the conference I was attending ended pretty late, I had to get my chicken fix somewhere else and ended up at Mert's.

I got there around 8 and found the restaurant to be somewhat empty.  Rather than eating there, I decided I would have a better time eating back at my hotel since there wasn't much going on at the restaurant.  It wasn't until on the walk back I realized that the steam from the hot foods probably softened up the fried chicken!  I was prepared to be disappointed...

BUT the amazing thing was that the chicken leg quarter that I ordered was not only juicy, but the skin had somehow retain much of it's crispiness.  As I start to gnaw into the fried chicken, with each bite I was amazed at how flavorful it is.  Didn't need any sauce or anything, it was tasty as is.  Like I mentioned, the chicken is juicy.  Dark meat is always the way to go for me for fried chicken!

With the fried chicken, I also got to choose two sides, so I went for the yams and mac & cheese.  Lots of spices for the yams, and I like how it still retained its chunky form.  As for the mac & cheese, I only liked the part where the cheese had caramelized.  Not too special to me.

It also comes with this awesome cornbread and softened sweet butter.  Cornbread + butter is seriously one of the best combos.  I know butter is good with a lot of things, but when you have a tasty cornbread, butter just enhances it so well!

Even with it steaming in its own heat for around 10 minutes as I walked back to the hotel, the chicken was still awesome.  I can only imagine how great it would've been if I ate there!),(Not sure about heart and soul but it was definitely a solid meal.  One thing I really like about this place is the artwork and decor.  They also have outdoor seating on the sidewalk.  I got the beef ribs and dark meat chicken.  Yes it's a lot of food assholes.  And yes I finished it (most of it) but this is 2 hours after having a breakfast buffet at the hotel.  Sides were delish.  I got the yams and okra\/tomatoes.),(The fried chicken is crispy and damn good. The mac and cheese is appropriately mac-y and cheesy. The chicken tenders are everything you want them to be (on a salad they're almost healthy*). The slaw is chopped until it's almost pureed, and it's freshness cuts through all that grease. And believe me, I'm happy as a pig in shit** sitting outside listening to the Beverly Hills Cop theme song, shaking Texas Pete onto a quarter chicken with a Carolina Blonde to cool me down.

But I would give all that up if it didn't include the cornbread. 

These tall, warm, individual mini-loaves are the fluffiest, moistest pieces of cornbread I've ever encountered, and with the slab of whipped, sweet butter melting slowly into the golden sides...I would come back just for this cornbread and nothing else. 

But if I HAVE to order the fried chicken to get it, I'll bite that bullet.

Well, it is deep dish pizza, but it's not Chicago deep dish (buttery crust, piles of cheese, sauce on top). And that's ok...I tried Jet's deep dish anyway! Note - there is no seating in Jet's, it's delivery or carry out only. 

Hubs picked it up (but they deliver too) and it was pretty damn delicious. Thick 'za (1.5"" or so) topped with tasty, melty cheese and loads of fresh veggies. The deep dish wasn't too greasy IMO, but then again maybe the grease soaked into the buttery crust. I believe hubs paid $10.99 + one topping for a large (ten squares).

In terms of the Monterreys here, I would rank this one second behind the Matthews location. I still think that one has better salsas than the others. This Monterrey does have a good sized patio, though.

Monterrey has a lunch menu that runs from 11am-3pm. They also have different specials every day. I pretty much order anything that's covered in cheese dip.... chimichangas (I recommend getting them soft instead of fried) or pollo fundido. My friend Andrea always gets fajitas. That's pretty much her go-to at every Mexican restaurant. Starter wise, you get complimentary chips and salsa. I go cheese dip over guac because I feel like their guac doesn't have that much flavor. 

It by no means is the best Mexican food in Charlotte, but it's a solid option for the price. It's not fancy. You'll smell like Mexican food after you leave. It's a big hit with the college kids in the University area. The last time I was here, a party of about 30 sorority girls came in for dinner and drinks. The staff didn't miss a beat with the large group. 

My only complaint about Monterrey is that there isn't a convenient location for me. I'm near uptown, so I have to drive to Matthews or Monterrey to get my fix.

I'm a huge fan of Le's Sandwiches, but I'm not on the north side of town a whole lot. And, that parking lot looks a scene from Armageddon. Crispy Banh Mi saves the day by opening up shop on South Blvd! In comparison, Crispy is about the same price and also super budget friendly. Unlike Le's, Crispy does take a credit card.

My order: the grilled pork banh mi, egg rolls, and a Thai tea. There are all kinds of different sandwich options here (including vegetarian). If you can't decide, ask for help from the cashier. Personally, I say go with the grilled pork. You can't go wrong with it. As Jeff S pointed out, I like that the egg rolls weren't pack with a bunch of filler type ingredients. There's also an entire menu of coffee, smoothies, green teas, boba, and desserts. 

Crispy Banh Mi is tucked away in a strip mall next to Pep Boys and across the street from the Panda Express. There's a handful of tables, so you may have to take it to go depending on how busy it is. If you haven't explored this area of South Blvd, go there immediately. Some of Charlotte's best gems in this 'hood: Burrito Factory, Vietnam Grill, NY Pizza, and Jasmine Grill.),(You've checked in here 11 times! What keeps you coming back?

Yelp has been yelling at me so I thought now is the time to write my Crispy Banh Mi review.  There are many reasons why I love Crispy Banh Mi, first of all, I love their hours, they open at 9a most mornings.  And their Thai Iced tea reminds me of tea carts on the streets of Bangkok, minus the bees.

Their menu is pretty straightforward but it seems like there's always something new to try.  I haven't even ventured to try other teas, because I'm too obsessed with Thai Iced tea.  

Service is always pleasant and efficient, prices are excellent.  My only complaint is sometimes it's like a saltlick on the sandwiches, not enough to stop me from eating tho'. And certainly I keep returning!

I even have Billy hooked now! #billywillyoubanhmisomething),(Baaaaasically I can always eat a Banh Mi. Bread is one of the joys of life and a crispy baguette filled with pickled carrots, fresh cilantro, and meat is a simple joy in life for under $5. Compared to the others I've tried this one was a little less amazing, but those flavors and freshness always deserve 4 stars. 

This restaurant offers thinly sliced meat options instead of the larger chunks I'm used to where you can see the marinated flavors on the outside skin. The fresh jalapeño slices were also intense so I had to remove them and just drizzle some sriracha for tolerable heat. Maybe thinner sliced jalapeños would be easier to eat. 

The location is easy to get to and service was super fast. They offer lots of drinks: smoothies, teas, juices, coffees, and then appetizers and noodle bowls too. I tried the jackfruit, lychee, coconut milk dessert drink with jellies and it was pretty good! Super sweet but I love trying new fruits and these were good.)"

They can heat them there or you can take them home to do so yourself. I'd get one again if I stumbled in for an earlier visit. The Sweet Lorraine is awesome. Much better if split between two, maybe three, people and also a glass of milk, cup of coffee, or biscuit. The mix of cookie and brownie works well and the soft center really brings the crispier edges together for an overall welcoming texture. Yes, please, and thank you very much.

You don't necessarily have to go with the burrito. They offer salads and nachos and tacos and quesadillas and even soup.

I have to agree with Dave's much earlier review - the cilantro lime rice is really good here but the chips are better at Salsaritas. And going a bit further, the salsa is better at Moe's.

The atmosphere is pretty plain. Nothing daring or over the top. I recommend sitting outside if it is nice. 

Do yourself a favor and order the zucchini and eggplant chips. Lightly salted, nice crunch and served with a refreshing tzatziki. 

I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs. A generous helping of pasta and the meatballs were very robust and hearty. I wasn't disappointed at all. 

My wife ordered the Greek salad. Pretty standard and nothing to complain about. Nice and fresh ingredients. A nice touch with the cucumber, I might add. Good balance with the striking flavors of the kalamatas. 

We ended up ordering dessert. A rarity for us. We ordered the ricotta cheesecake. It had a very perky and tangy raspberry glaze and a hint of lemon zest. Not a bad combo. The texture was a little wrong, but mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of ricotta. Definitely worth the culinary venture, though.

We entertained ourselves by catching up, people-watching, and then finally, looking at the menu as we prepared for our order.  (The menu is huge by the way, so it was hard for us to narrow down what we wanted... everything sounded amazing from the appetizers , soups, salads, and sandwiches to the entrees , pizzas, pastas, and sides).

We were seated at a table in the back after waiting just over 30 minutes or so... and we immediately ordered drinks and a ""Traditional Greek Spreads"" tasting plate, ""Pikilia.""  It came out pretty fast (along with whole wheat pita) and we dove right in... I highly recommend all of the spreads, but the Roasted Red Pepper spread was our fave!

For our meals, I went with the Greek Country Salad and added lamb and Sloan went for the Capellini & Diver Scallops.  We shared two sides as well: Charred Asparagus and Greek ""Fries.""  Everything was delicious although I will warn you that if you order the Greek Country Salad, be prepared for lots of red onion!

Service was pretty spot on.  Our waiter checked in with us often and refilled our drinks before they got too low.  He also replaced the cocktail napkins several times - gotta love that attention!  There was also a fun, happening vibe in the restaurant yet it wasn't too loud to have an intimate conversation either...

Service is usually pretty good, except for when they had 1 server for an entire table of 18 the first time around.  Their many creative drinks as well as basic liquors can be ordered on their fancy iPad menu.  With a speakeasy vibe and fancy iPad menu also comes a speakeasy price, similar to that in NYC.  Drinks here are not the cheapest on the block, but you definitely get what you pay for.

I only got food the first time around and from what I remember, everyone was pretty happy with my choice of restaurant (thanks Yelp!) and we all left with happy stomachs.  I personally enjoyed the truffle fries and the tuna tartare, which came with a bit of chili oil for a kick, guacamole, and wonton chips.  Also good were the scallops.  You can't really go wrong with any of the food here and it's definitely way better than your average bar food.  I recommended this place to an old college friend who was in Charlotte for a while and got kudos for it - he called it he best restaurant in Charlotte!

Will continue to frequent this spot until I finally get to leave my travel assignment in Charlotte :)),(So it looks like I will be in Charlotte for a bit and wanted to start the trip off with some good food and drinks. Was able to meet up with a friend and we decided to hit up the Cellar based on all the rave reviews. Wrapped up work and made the walk over to this joint which you will see by the signs. You do in fact have to walk down the stairs and when I did, I knew it was already going to be good. The greeters are extremely friendly and were happy to accommodate our seating at the bar. 

The interior of this joint is pretty slick and definitely has that speakeasy vibe. There are plenty of tables across the sides of the wall, higher tables in the middle, and the seats at the bar itself. The bartenders were super friendly and was very knowledgeable about their drinks. They had a solid selection of whiskeys and I was happy to continue drinking a variety of different whiskeys. The drink menus are provided on an IPAD so it is quick to scroll through your potential options. My friend had a cocktail which he said was spot on and he tried a few other ones saying they were all solid. We decided to order food as well which ended up being the tuna tartare and the burger. The tuna was pretty solid and came with wonton chips which I could not help but sneak a bite even though it was against my diet. It came with guacamole was a good compliment making this an all around solid starter. The burger was solid and the gruyere cheese was the right choice for it. It was cooked right to my liking and was definitely chowed down in no time.

All in all, a good spot with great drink choices, good ambiance, friendly servers, and good food. What more can you ask for?)"

I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much, since I grew up with tons of Vietnamese people and grew up in an area where good, authentic Vietnamese food was abundant.  So, after eating at Pho Plus, I can confidently say that they serve up some fairly authentic tasting pho with a decent broth that is comparable to Vietnamese food in the Atlanta suburbs (Buford Hwy, anyone?).   

I would skip the appetizers.  The spring rolls (cha gio) were mediocre and the summer rolls (goi cuon) were less than mediocre.  Very skinny rolls with little filling and the outer rice sheet was too firm.  I have not had the banh mi here, so I can't comment on that.

As for the pho, I got the rare steak with tripe, as I always get at every single pho restaurant.  I loved that Pho Plus offers up a very delicious and very spicy hot chili oil that goes really well with the soup, if you're looking for some heat.  A little goes a really long way as it was pretty damn spicy for all of us and we eat a lot of spicy food, but it's a good addition to the broth and I don't usually put anything but lime in my broth.  The noodles were cooked nicely and were not soggy, as some bad pho places might have.  The broth was hot, beefy, and spiced the way it should be with the proper Vietnamese herbs.

Proper way to eat pho - add bean sprouts, Thai (Asian) basil, jalapenos (just to make the broth spicier), and a squeeze of lime.  Some people like to throw in Sriracha and hoisin sauce into the broth, but I prefer mixing the two on the side and dipping my meat in it.

I'll be back when I'm craving Vietnamese food!),(Very friendly people, during lunch is very busy, fast service, great place in uptown to get Pho & eat Vietnamese food! I would definitely recommend eating here if you haven't tried it yet. - Chris Porfeli

Well let's be honest, I think all weather is pho weather. You'll find me with a giant bowl when it's triple digit heat outside. And this is the closest place to my house to get my fix.

Pho Hoa Restaurant is a chain with dozens of restaurants around the world. I'll agree with Ben N. though, the store here in Charlotte has the feel of a mom-and-pop type pho place. My pho order is the exact same at every noodle place: meatballs as my only protein. Tripe, tendon, and all that jazz are just not my jam. I think the broth has great flavor here. The fresh rolls and fried spring rolls are both good. Bonus: they also have bomb ass bubble tea.

Two phos, an order of fresh rolls, an order of fried spring rolls, and two Cokes totaled up to be $32.45. Note: sodas come in cans, so if you're a refill kind of person... you have been warned. Service is always pretty prompt. I do a lot of take out orders and I'm always in and out quickly.

Is it the best in Charlotte? I'm not answering that question. I'll let you guys continue your debate over who wins in our pho scene.),(A little surprised I hadn't reviewed Pho Hoa in the first place, but had the pleasure of having Pho for dinner last night. Learned a few new things this time 'round and couldn't be happier. 

Here's a few fun facts: 

Apparently, this place is a chain with several other locations with the Pho Hoa branding, but each location retains creative control over menu items, development, etc. 

The divider in the men's room is an old kitchen galley door. Rad.

Jalapenos are freaking hot.

Sriracha is an institution. 

Loved the Pho Thai. Some of the most ""buttery"" broth I've had to date. Broths vary from restaurant to restaurant and Pho Hoa makes the short list for me. The summer rolls are top notch, too. 

Plenty of boba options, too. I'm a large proponent of the avocado variety.),(Pho Hoa was a staple restaurant that I used to go to a million times with my family when they had a location in the metro Atlanta area.  I basically grew up eating pho from this franchise.  I was hardcore craving some pho tonight, so a few coworkers and I went to go try it out, based on the rave reviews.

Upon pulling up at the rather run down looking shopping center and ugly facade of the restaurant, my coworkers all looked at me like I was nuts for taking them to some run-down building in what seemed like the boonies (but obviously wasn't).  The inside was much more promising than the outside and there was a steady dinner crowd on a Wednesday night, which is pretty good considering that place is basically a lone gem on that stretch of road.

I've had one other pho place in Charlotte - Pho Plus in Uptown.  My coworker and I agreed Pho Hoa was better.  The broth and spice was super flavorful and on point and the meat amount was reasonable.  The prices here are slightly higher than I've paid in Atlanta, but it's still 100% worth it.  I got the steak (which could have been more rare, in my opinion, if I had anything to complain about), tripe (yum!), tendon, and beef ball soup.  You can build your own pho here, which allows you to customize.  Their menu is set up in a way that helps pho-beginners choose their dishes and more experienced-pho'kers to more complex dishes.

The appetizers are so-so here - cha gio (fried spring rolls) are filled with juicy and flavorful meat and comes with the standard nuoc mam (fish sauce).  The goi cuon (summer rolls with pork and shrimp) are a little lackluster and puny, but that's not to say they weren't still delicious.  Comes with a hoisin\/peanut sauce.

On a side note, Jeremy Lin eats here!

Staff\/owner was really nice.  Would definitely come back when I am in town again.)"

The cocktail menu has about 10-15 drinks all priced between $8-$11. They also carry a variety of wines and bubblies, including cava's and bruts. 

I must not be a champagne connoisseur because the $11 and the $18 champagne all tasted the same to me. I would recommend Mez for their interesting cocktails, specifically the grapefruit infused Juniper Breeze.

Unfortunately they have one port and no white dessert wines.),(So a weekend matinee.......so a few drinks were a nice way to start the movie.

The ambience here is definitely on the upbeat and trendy side - even on a Tuesday evening it was pretty bumpin'.  I was probably here for like 4 hours or something and never did I feel like the place was getting too quiet or anything like that.  I would recommend making a reservation since it seems like the place gets pretty crowded... actually, it could have been Restaurant Week, which would explain why it was so busy... but my memory fails me.  The decor is modern - place is dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see your food or your company.   Service was pretty good, if I recall correctly.

As for the food - we got an assortment of several different things ranging from spicy edamame, some appetizers, to an assortment of their finer sushi.  The spiced chili edamame was a good concept, but the sauce was a bit strange and I think I prefer the normal salted kind.  The yellowtail carpaccio was nicely marinated - I always enjoy a crudo\/fish carpaccio as an appetizer.  We also had the five-spiced pork belly - this left a bit to be desired as well.  I prefer my pork belly melt-in-your-mouth style and this was on the chewier side.  We also tried one of their rolls as well as their sashimi - the fish is pretty decent, but it's by no means top grade sushi.  However, it's good enough to satisfy any sushi craving.

In short, probably your best option for sushi in Uptown Charlotte, nice service, and excellent ambience\/atmosphere\/vibe.),(Alright so with nearly 10 months of being in charlotte I cannot deny my sushi cravings so I had to hit up a sushi joint one week. After a bit of searching, I fell upon this place with a fellow yelp elite and we decided to give it a run and since then, i have showed up multiple times post that initial visit. The place is very trendy and has a very open atmosphere with high ceilings. The décor is beautiful and the restaurant has always been packed every time I have shown up to this joint. The spots will fill up quick so make sure to make your reservation in advance. The servers\/waiting staff\/bartenders are all super friendly and very accommodating. Every time that I have been here, I have been seated quickly and with our servers not too far behind us. 

The joint itself has a solid menu and just keep in mind that this is a primarily ""roll"" oriented menu which they do well. I personally don't eat a lot of rolls as I am not big on the sauce but even I could give it a solid nod for the combinations they came up with. The fish is fresh although I wont say it's the freshest so the rolls will definitely be the way to go. The fish is good quality although you can tell that some of them have been frozen. Even with that everything is definitely solid and probably the best sushi spot I have had the opportunity to visit while being in charlotte thus far. I will say the service is top notch here which just adds a nice kick up to the experience. They have always been cordial and even saved my life by protecting my wallet one time with no missing items so god bless these guys.

A solid joint and definitely ""THE"" spot to visit in Charlotte if you are looking for sushi and a nice atmosphere for dinner.)"

Came in a few weeks back for some bread baking tools. Needed a rolling pin and a new cutting board. The rolling pin was an easy find, but the cutting board selection was a little abysmal. We found one towards the front of the store that was on display. The place was slammed, but one of the employees happily walked to the back and picked it out for us. I was really surprised at how inexpensive it was, too. She didn't even try and throw in the annoying up-sell towards the end. Just asked if there was anything else we were looking for. 

There is a great selection of smaller drawer tools that you can sift through. This section typically reminds you of what you don't have and could use...or use another of.

The salads (chicken salad) is made fresh daily and the meats are carved - big fan of that over here! The staff was super nice and offered to let hubs and I try any of the meats or salads before we made our decision. Sweet! Also, a few of the sandwiches can be purchased halves and there is a variety of side items, cookies, drinks, etc. 

I went with The Rambler: Honey Baked Turkey Club Sandwich with Bacon, Mayo, Lettuce and Tomato on a Pretzel roll. The sammie was delicious, the turkey super fresh and the pretzel roll was seriously good. While the portion was plenty for me, the meal itself was a bit on the pricey side for what I received.

As Quips, they offer the sandwich plus one side (which can be a drink, chips, cookie, etc)...I was just hoping for a little more value if you know what I mean!

Kids can kick, scream, stomp, and cry their way to the dinner table, but the tears dry up when pizza is thrown into the mix. What kid doesn't want pizza? 

This place is magnificent for kids. Plenty of games for them to ""think"" they are playing without actually shelling out any quarters for. The make-line window for the kids to watch is brilliant. A small platform with steps up to the glass lets kids watch to their heart's content. 

As for the adults, plenty of draft, and local, brews and delicious pizza. The Sicilian is one of my favorites. Deep(er) dish pizza with a mix of meats and veggies. Throw on some of their buffalo sauce and you've got a flavorful party where all of your taste buds are invited. 

Service is always snappy, patio is always hoppin' and the food is dependable. Thanks, Hawthorne's. You guys know what you're doing. Cheers!),(What I like about Hawthorne's is its consistancy- I know when I go here what I'm getting is the pizza the best I've ever had NO but its still good - the wings are pretty good as well.  They have a lot to offer on the menu and good beers on draft.  The patio is awesome and as long as they don't put you next to a bunch of unsupervised children you'll have a good time.),(I'm still on my plight for the best pizza in Charlotte, and while I'm not ready to officially crown Hawthorne's as my pizza king, they still dole out some pretty sweet slices. 

Hawthorne's is a fairly straight forward pizza join - there are two areas, one large dining room and one more ""bar-ish"" area with plenty of high top tables. Hubs and I usually grab a seat in the latter as there can be lots 'o kiddos running around in the main dining area (depending on the day, of course). The service is quick and friendly and they have a decent beer list to accompany their 'za.

If I'm super hungry I'll usually start off with the Garlic Cheese Bread - exactly what you would think: a hefty portion of toasted French bread, smothered in a multitude of cheeses and garlic and served with a very tasty marinara. Truth - sometimes I just prefer to make this my meal with a small side salad. But...if I'm ordering pizza, I'm a fan of their veggie as well as their white pizza. I do, however, feel the need to blot that sucker every time it comes out. But hey - that seems normal, right?

Thanks to Hawthorne's I can grab a tasty slice at lunch or hang out for a while and take down a multitude of cheesy goodness.),(This was one of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte until I discovered Tony's in Ballantyne and Libretto's, but I still love the location and it is perfect for meeting friends for a beer or glass of wine and sharing a pie.  The garlic knots are still pretty tasty and frickin HUGE! The staff is super friendly and very accomadating.  Even though their pizza is not #1 in my heart their pasta dishes are absolutely delicious.  I love love loved teh sauce for the gueyere penne and I substituted the suggested chicken or sausage with shrimp yummmmm.  The lasagna made me never want to make my own at home again!  I think the pizza has plenty of cheese and good taste they just need a crisper crust.  I have not visited any other locations and I do not feel the desire to.  The location in Elizabeth is pretty great all around.)"

This is the USA Swimming Officials hang out since it's just a few blocks away from the Mecklenburg Aquatic Center. As a matter of fact this Dilworth Neighborhood Grille has been a sponsor of the Grand Prix Swim Meet for several years.

Dilworth has there own private lot and when really busy I am unsure where customers park, it must be challenged. I never see any debris in the lot and it always seems like things are tidy on the exterior of the building.

I can honestly say after repeated visits there is a high level of consistency in both food and service. I have not had a poor service, or meal that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. The tap beer selection is solid with variety of NC Craft, IPA and domestics. 

The atmosphere is fun and pub like around the bar. The dining room is more restaurant like and is suitable for children as they do have a kids menu. The adult menu is what you would pretty much expect and pub like with sandwiches and burgers. There are dinner dishes as well, but I have never tried them. They have some tasty appetizers like wings too.

It is not uncommon for large parties, banquets etc. to book here. They can accommodate a large party with special rooms and this usually does not distract from the customer service experience. However, on my last day in Charlotte a wedding party of around 30 hit the bar at once. It appeared to be a challenge, but I did not see where they could not handle. 

I would encourage you to give Dilworth Neighborgood Grille a try if you have never experienced. I personally am a fan and will be back the next time in the area.)"

Conveniently located off of South Blvd., Laurel Market's menu is chock full of sandwiches of all types - for breakfast, lunch, veg heads, meat lovers, etc. Make sure you pay attention to their deli hours (7 am-3 pm, Mon-Sat) so you don't miss out on a delish breakfast burrito or deli sandwich. And, as others have noted, there are only a few tables out front to hang out and eat - so don't be surprised if you have to take your goods to go. 

I tried the CAST sandwich - freshly sliced turkey, green apple, cheddar, honey mustard & lettuce stuffed between two slices of sourdough (my choice of bread). It was super tasty, full of sinus-clearing honey mustard  and plenty of sandwich. With a bag of chips, a can of rootbeer, my big lunch amounted to $9.90. Suffice it to say, I made a meal and a half out of it. 

While you're there, check out the other goods - plenty of chips and accompaniments, massive ""Cowboy"" cookies, beverages, a smattering of wine and beer, and more. The staff here are extremely sweet and want to make sure you get exactly what you're looking for. Plus - they offer catering! 

I'm absolutely looking forward to stopping by Laurel Market soon to try out more of their sandwich menu and perhaps score a famed breakfast burrito!)"

Doing some shopping at Toy R Us across from Concord Mills today and decided to give Fosters a try.  Had heard several good comments on the specialty which is a Charburger and wanted to try it.

I will give them credit. The Charburger is an excellent burger with great taste and flavor much like Burger King had in the early 80's when they were CharBroiled. A little heavy on the condiments meaning everything wants to slid off but other than than, an excellent tasteful choice.

Going back to the beginning, you walk in and go to the counter and they have menu pads where you circle what you want and pay. They give you your beverage cups and a number you place at your table. I ordered had squeeze lemonade so I had to wait a minute but joined my wife shortly at a table over to the side.

My wife ordered a Philly Cheese steak and a side of fruit.along with tea. The rest of my order in addition to the burger described above was a half order of fries.

Service is very slow and it took almost 15 minutes for our order to arrive. As I pointed out, the Charburger lives up to it's reputation but the fries were limp and oily.  Very little lemon in the lemonade so it ended up tasting like slight tart sugar water

 My wife did not like her Philly Cheese Steak because it had been made with a poor quality meat and no peppers and little onions on the sandwich. The side of fruit was a prepackaged container of Dole Mixed Fruit still in the original container.

Staff was friendly and the restaurant clean and they have a lot of other activities during the week to appeal to families with small children but that did not do much for us.

The Charburger is worth giving it shot but little else does)"

I was tired of the other food court restaurants in the center of the airport.

I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza (Duh! Signature CPK!) and a small SmartWater and that set me back almost $18 - yikes.  Airport prices for ya.

After a 10-15 minute wait, I finally got my pizza.  I took it with me to my gate so I could sit and eat in peace.  This was literally the worst pizza, let alone CPK, that I've ever had in my life.  The crust, or lack of crust, or bread, or whatever you want to call it, was reminiscent of stale flour tortilla with supermarket BBQ sauce and like a few pieces of chicken on top.  The best part of the pizza was probably the fresh basil they had on there.  I can't even begin to explain how hard it was to chew the pizza given it's strange, chewy texture.  I should have taken a cross-section of the pizza - it was literally as thin, or thinner, than a flour tortilla.  Maybe a half-cooked, 3 week old tortilla.

Save your money and eat at some other expensive airport restaurant.  And skip the $5 SmartWater.),(First time at CPK for breakfast. I cannot recall seeing one at an airport. Located in terminal B.

I asked for recommendation. Egg & Cheese was said to be top seller. Service by manager friendly, no issues with ordering process on a slow morning. Prices high, but an airport, so you know the drill bend over.

Food out within 5 min and was in a huge to go bag. They never asked if for here, or to go. I was eating in.

Dining room spotless and quite large. Nice bar in the middle. A few CPK pieces on the wall for atmosphere.

Sandwich above expectation. Hot, fresh eggs, gooey cheese and crisp bread tasted to perfection. Liked and if returning would get it again.

A nice grab and go area us up front constantly manned by an employee. Solid collection of drinks and food items.

Visit except for not asking if dine\/carry out was excellent. I will return if back in the area and now look for them in airports. Overall 3.5, rounding down for missed opportunity at counter that involved manager.),(After my last meal at the Charlotte airport, I decided to stick to something I knew and went to California Pizza Kitchen. I hardly eat at chain restaurants at home, but it seems this trip was all of that. 

Truth be told, I really came here, because it has a bar attached and they were playing the final playoff game before the World Series and being a Giants fan, that was my priority. 

I had a seat facing the TV, ordered a nice local lager on tap and a Margarita pizza from CPK next door. My beer was fabulous and the pizza was pretty good. I liked how the dough bubbled up and was light and airy. 

Even though my review should be about the bar next door, this is what I ate and it was definately a lot better than my last meal here.)"

Before you freak out, Birdsong didn't go too far. The new spot is just down the street. The big difference: this new location is more than triple the size of the old one. 

Big chalkboards behind the bar describe the beer selections. There are currently four year round beers here. The jalapeno pale ale is my favorite. Don't be scared of the name, it doesn't have a heat to it. I can only drink a couple of these at a time. I really love their Doin Thyme Spring-Summer seasonal, too. I was super excited to this one at the BB&T Ballpark craft beer area. Birdsong releases a new small batch beer every Thursday for THURSty THURSdays. They also do free tours every Thursday at 6:30pm.

Birdsong has a nice little outdoor patio area. This is kind of an odd area, so don't expect a big scenic landscape. The brewery is both kid and pet friendly. There are no TVs. If you're looking to watch a game, you're in the wrong place. They do not serve food, but there is usually a food truck on site. Check their Facebook or Twitter pages for info each day on that. 

Kudos on the upgrade, Birdsong. I can't wait to watch your brand continue to grow.),(Cool atmosphere and while I didn't drink my friends did  and they said the beers were great.),(Easily one of the best experiences in Charlotte. Everyone that works here is so fantastic. 

Our bar tender, Justin, listened to our likes and wants, and he was such a genuine soul. I seriously thought he made the whole experience 5 plus stars and I absolutely adored him! He asked what I like to drink, and I jokingly said mimosas, so he mixed a cider with a beer and told me I was in for a surprise. It was HEAVENLY and mimosa-esque! He talked to us about our travels, gave us food suggestions in our upcoming cities, and threw in a four pack of our fave beer ON HIM to ""enjoy on the beaches in Charleston"" for him. And he wasn't just treating us this way.... he treated each and every one of his customers just like that. 

I was also able to chat with the owner while the BF was grabbing more of the unlimited peanuts, and he takes such pride in his establishment. I had a huge smile on my face just from watching him beam. 

In a city that has a ton of breweries, this is definitely THE one you should go out of your way for. Fave experience in Charlotte for sure.)"

Key word here: fresh. The only freezer they have in this place is in front of the counter and it's filled with King of Pops. That's right, no freezer in the kitchen. 

I hate to even have to use the C word here, but this is similar to a Chipotle. It's fast casual Mexican. However, this is a locally owned and operated restaurant by a husband and wife team. Not a chain. And it's delicious. 

You can score lunch here for less than ten bucks. Tacos, burritos, bowls, salads and lot of different protein options. On Tuesdays, they do all their burritos and burrito bowls for just $5. I always get a burrito bowl when I come here. Tacos are $2 after 4pm every day. All of their salsa and beans are made from scratch with fresh ingredients. I like that there's also a brown rice option. They slow cook the pork and shredded beef for six hours, grind the top round for the ground beef dishes. A ton of work goes into all their food. For the colder months, they just started doing a chicken tortilla soup.

But we were really happy when Picante opened up since it's still near campus and it's a change of pace from your burger\/diner style joints. 

How's the food? 

It's pretty good. If you are a fan of Chipotle, Qdoba and Moe's, then you'll probably like Picante. The chicken, steak, shredded beef, and fish are really good. They occasionally introduce specials and new items to the menu too (buffalo chicken or philly cheesesteak burritos). They have drink specials and even do punch cards for free burritos.

The owner and his wife are super friendly, as well as the rest of the staff. The price is pretty much on par with the competitors, if not a little lower.

The timing was perfect, the hunger was imminent, and wings were on the menu. 

On our way, we read a few other reviews and were a little iffy about dining in or taking out. We decided the full experience was necessary.

We settled on a large basket of fries with a side of medium sauce for my wife and 10 wings (5 Medium and 5 Honey Hot) for me. 

The fries are great. Krinkle cut with a subtle dusting of seasoning salt. The medium sauce....Textbook. It really does stick the the doctrine of ""medium"" and doesn't provide too much spiciness. Pungent flavor and well rounded with a buttery finish. 

The wings are evenly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and a good mix of flats and drums. I'm a big fan of the mixture as I feel flats tend to have more flavor and are more tender. The sauces work wonders on chicken. Goodness gracious. The medium will make any dyed in the wool wing-lover weak at the knees. The honey hot is something out of a romance novel. A sweet, succulent sauce that is thick like honey and has a slight twinge of heat. We even started dipping our fries in it! Usually 10 wings is too much for me, but I muscled through these bad boys with ease.

As for their sides, the asparagus w\/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly stop your heart literally and figuratively. And last but not least, their desserts are just delectable. Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out of this world.

I was looking around Uptown for a quick meal since I was still feeling the effects of jetlag and ended up at Tin Tin Box.  I've noticed that many of the Asian\/Japanese spots around Uptown offer ""hibachi"" type meals.  You rarely see that term in CA so I was definitely curious.  Found Tin Tin Box on Yelp and decided to try the Hibachi Combination.

The Combination comes with chicken, beef, and shrimp cooked on a hot flat top with mushrooms and their sauce, which is most likely some sort of seasoned soy sauce.  You get to choose from rice, fried rice, and even brown rice, which is nice for the people looking to eat more healthy.  I went for the fried rice and then went upstairs to their dining floor.

The chicken and beef looked precooked when the cook brought it out , and the only thing that really needed to be cooked was the shrimp.  I was really disappointed with the shrimp, since it had such a fishy taste to it, probably from being thawed out.  The chicken was probably the best, since it did soak up the sauce fairly well.  The beef was just diced up cubes of pieces.  It's all made better by their dipping sauce though.  Some sort of mayo-based sauce, it's sweet, almost like a milder version of thousand island!  However, I could only eat so much of the sauce before I felt it was too greasy. 

Now... it is fast foodish so I didn't expect them to make the fried rice on the spot or anything, but I was really disappointed when the fried rice was just lukewarm.

For a quick lunch, this place might be okay since this place would have your food out really fast.  Panda Express might be a better. Probably should've gone to the other Japanese spots around the corner from my hotel to check out ""Hibachi"" though!)"

Several weeks ago, I went to a Yelp Event here and was totally blown away with the new menu items and the phenomenal service. I gave the even an excellent rating because it was and well deserved and came back today to check out the restaurant under normal operations.

Sad to say, it did not meet expectation.

Service was slow, particular at the end when we were trying to check out. Service was also not accurate serving my wife a baked potato when she ordered potato soup and the quality of my Crispy Chicken Sandwich was just not there.

To expand, we drove down from Cornelius today for and early lunch. Got there about 11:30 and were promptly seated. No problems so far.

Our server presented herself and we ordered out beverages and my wife ordered a cocktail to go with her lunch.

When our drinks were served, we ordered out lunch.  I upgraded to a Premium Blue Cheese Wedge Salad and for my entree, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich.

My wife ordered the small Alice Springs Filet with Asparagus and Potato Soup.  Potato Soup came out as Baked Potato and had to be corrected.

My Wedge was good but quite frankly, I'm used to the Salad Course being served prior to the main course, not with.

The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was a bit too much crispy as the photo will show.  A bit of breading makes for a Crispy Chicken but when the depth of the Breading is twice the thickness of the Chicken, it's a bit much.  The Chicken Breast as such did not have a great resilient texture and left much to be desired.

Finally when it came time to settle the bill, I gave the server my Credit Card and she was gone for over 10 minutes. At this time, the restaurant, still had not gotten busy so no reason to explain the delay.

I had hopes for this place after the great initial experience but now I don't know.

I hadn't been to this Reid's before and I was blown away with the entire layout of the joint. Spin around with your eyes closed and then point in any direction. You're bound to find something that's either A) awesome B) expensive C) just don't look at the pricetag and get it or D) a little too haute cuisine for anyone's taste. Which, in my opinion, is awesome. 

Sure. People complain about expensive grocery stores, blah blah blah. Reid's is a NICE store. They tend to carry some seriously vanity-type foods that you can't exactly score at your local farmer's market or bigger chain. We located some ice creams we couldn't find elsewhere and also noticed some beer varieties that we can only find at some of our bottle shops in town. 

I'll tip my hat to Reid's. Good show, gents. 

However, the parking.....is just awful. Awful doesn't event explain how horrible it is. There's even a dude sleuthing the parking lot from end to end just itching to boot your car, give you a ticket or *gasp* worse. Eff that, dude. I'd recommend parking down the street or across Selwyn if you can help it.),(Specialty food should be special. There should be a reason why you pay a bit extra for a few morsels of goodness. Reid's has a lock on these specialty foods with a nice looking meat department, array of choice cheeses and impressive wine selection. Let's break down this location a bit, shall we?

The Good: As mentioned, it's a great spot to grab a quick bite, snag a bottle of wine, some tasty snacks and get on your merry way. The service is pretty spectacular - whether your seeking said bottle of wine or dining on a sandwich during lunch. Many of the sandwiches and salads I saw coming around looked fresh and delicious. Also, there's a decent sized wine bar next to the wine vault\/selection area that could kick your feet up while you taste away. 

The Meh: The parking is pretty much horrendous. Unless you're stealing parking from business across the street, you better be comfortable walking a ways. The sandwich I ate here was underwhelming - the grilled pimento cheese was gut busting-ly greasy (granted, it's grilled pimento cheese) and also missed the zing I was looking for. I barely got through half of the sloppy mess and had to put it down for fear that I may have a heart attack in the shop. 

If I'm walkin' around Selwyn and need to score a few snacks before heading home, Reid's is a fine choice, yet they definitely have plenty of competition in the area if we're talking tasty sandwiches and wine tasting!)"

The quinoa was flavorful, but cold;  I would've preferred them served warm, but still,  very tasty.

No, it's still not the healthiest thing in the world (come on Heather, you wanted McDonalds!) but out of the choices, it seemed safe enough to possible have a satisfying meal.

They have a bunch of breakfast sandwiches they they prepare on spot (not sitting out under a hot lamp), and make bagel deli sandwiches as well.  If you are late connecting a flight, they also have prepared sandwiches before the check out.

Maybe it was the sleep deprivation...maybe it was the insane hunger...but I thought it was pretty good for airport food.  I got a standard egg, cheese, ham sandwich on an everything bagel for $4.86 after tax.  That aint bad!  Personally they could have charged more and gotten away with it.

It filled my hunger, was under $5 and I didn't die afterwards.  That is all I ask of airport food.),(Can we say PIZZA BAGEL!!!!!! YUM!!!!

Ok so I have not had a pizza bagel in years and as soon as I walked past here I knew what my dinner was going to be.  I only had about 15 min in between flights so I was not able to sit down and enjoy the entire feel of this restaurant but I got it to go.

So as I was reading the menu and my eyes landed on Chicken Park...I thought ""that is like a Pizza Bagel with chicken....SCORE"" Yes, i actually thought that =)

I went with the Chicken Parm and it was messy as all get out but so worth having sauce drip from the sides of my mouth and killing 5,232 napkins =)  So gooooood!!  

It was piping hot when I opened it so I had to let it sit for a moment and during that moment I swear the kid across from me was starring at me as if I had drool all over my chin.  Ok, Ok maybe there was drool on my chin =)

The bagel was amazingly fresh and chewy on the inside but a lovely golden brown on the outside.  They did not skimp on the cheese either and it was melted to perfection.  I think I finished the huge bagel delight in under 2 min =)  More reason for people to stare haha.

It was a lovely treat in a lovely airport, I was very pleased!!!),(Got off a red eye flight after a good nights sleep. it was about 7am. I was hungry, but that's nothing new if you know me.  Had a 2 hour layover (ugh!), but even if you're in a rush the service was pretty quick. Grabbed an egg, cheese and ham bagel sandwich. It was early and it hit the spot. The bagel kind of surprised me. Not too thick and tough. It was light, crisp, and easy to bite into. It was soft. 

Oh how the coffee blows. Go to Starbucks down the way.

Impressive view of the sunset coming up over the airfield on this rainy morning. Sit by the floor to ceiling window. Life could be worse.),(After a whole week of conch fritters, conch ceviche, numerous room service meals and seemingly bottomless Bahama Mamas, it's time to go back to eating normal, healthful type food. 

Plus, I only have $20 left in my wallet.

This full service bakery is located at the airport's B wing. I ordered a grilled Chicken on a multigrain bagel with lettuce, tomato and mustard. With a fruit cup and  bottled water, total was $15.     

I split that meal with my hunny. 

Yes, we were still hungry. 

So, there's this fried chicken joint next door...)"

What I found was a perfectly cozy corner stop, featuring what appeared to be a decent wine list, a carefully selected cadre of brews, and a menu full of rich new American staples. 131 Main won't refresh your take on modern American cuisine, but it might well remind you what you like about it. I had my way with the roasted chicken, paired with some really surprisingly tangy braised cabbage, and washed the whole thing down with an Olde Copper brew.

I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit. 

We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.

Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations. 

I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the ""Cellos."" Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie. 

Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy. 

Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. 

Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be. 

Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato. 

So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)),($5 Bar bites YES YES YES!  These really aren't just ""bites"" this is quite a deal that Vivace offers.  From 5 to 7 I think Mon. - Thurs. not really sure though - you can get a huge portion of mussels, calamari, pizza and more.  This place has one of the best outdoor seating areas in town and the service has always been great.  They have a nice wine selection but it's not cheap.  I asked about drink specials but they don't really do that here.  I give them 4 stars just for the $5 bar bites not only tasty but affordable.),(Definitely still a big fan of Vivace. It definitely is (still) one of the best looking restaurants in town with a sweet patio and *stunning* upstairs lounge area. If you're seeking a private party space you must check out that second floor. 

Service is spot on and are happy to not only describe the dishes, but they go above and beyond detailing the wines on special, where they come from, what the grapes are like, etc. The menu changes up on occasion and I had the pleasure of trying their new-ish chili capellini with crab. While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course. 

For dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato. Vivace is still one of my faves in the QC. Grazie!),(A few drinks here on a Friday night is what I consider the best way to kick off the weekend.

The upstairs bar is the place to be if you want it a bit more quiet, though in the winter months it can get crowded with the outdoor area void of anyone.),(I've been to Vivace three times already and I'm not going to stop. 
My first experience at Vivace was a bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary's brunch- and I was not disappointed. 

What to get at Vivace:
- The Vivace Way Brunch-  antipasti + piatti and  bottomless Mimosa & Bloody Mary drinks for $30
- Caprese salad. Yum!
- Summer Bibb salad. Fresh and tasty.
- Shrimp and Grits. It's a southern specialty, and even though it's parmesan polenta, it tasted great.
- Braised Short Rib Hash. So delicious, you'll order it over and over.
- For dinner, try the Ahi Tuna Crudo. It's to die for.

Why go to Vivace:
- Bottomless boozy brunches.
- Sophisticated.
- Convenient location. At the Metropolitan.
- Good service. 
- Can accommodate large groups.
- Patio dining.
- Gluten-free and Pescatarian menus.

So on a quiet date night evening, I brought us across town to the only frozen custard (FC) that I could find on Yelp. Good move, as she was seriously pleased and said that it was even better than her favorite FC place back in Arkansas. And that's really saying something because she really liked that place!

Good flavors - vanilla and chocolate and strawberry and light vanilla. Mixable. Plus they have frozen ices for people who enjoy that sort of thing. And a reasonable though not wide offering of toppings. The whipped cream is out of a can though.

 A great treat on a hot day. We'll be back!),(For a total treat monster like myself, Rita's is pretty tasty. With smiley employees and an array of cool sweet treats in a squeaky clean store, this place appeals to kids and adults alike. And, frankly, Charlotte doesn't have very many ice cream shops to patron, so their competition is slim. Mind you, I said *ice cream* not froyo. Rita's custard is definitely not frozen yogurt. 

Since I come from the Midwest, I know what custard is. It's thick, it's smooth it's creamy and dreamy. Overall, I like Rita's custard...it definitely fills the void, but it doesn't hold a candle to the places I frequented when I was a kid. Mmm Culver's. Anywho, while I enjoy the gelati (a combo of the custard and Italian ice), the Italian ice part almost send me into sugar shock. And I like sugar, friends.

Yes, I'll agree with others, the Italian ice is a bit insane. A bit bright. Neon, as Dion says. But hey, I enjoy a bit of creamy vanilla custard on a warm summer day. Do yourself a favor and get a smaller size...it's whole lotta sweet!)"

Along with regular menu items, the deli cranks out different specials and homemade soups daily. I took their Dilworth Special to the tv station recently for a segment and everyone fought over it afterwards. Yeah, it's pretty tasty. I usually go with a spicy turkey sandwich and one of the soups. Soup not your thing? They have plenty of homemade sides, too.

The patio here is tremendous. Perfect spot for people watching and live music. 

The parking lot can be tricky. If it's a busy time (say lunch rush), you may have to drive around the block to wait for someone to leave and steal their spot. Keep an eye out for parking spots on the street.),(Why hello, common market, and look at your stellar craft beer selection! 

I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from. You just seem to feel like branching out and trying a micro\/craft brew that you've never heard of before. Or, for the hipster at heart, grab a PBR and join the crowd. Their selection varies, so be sure to check back for seasonals and different locales to be featured\/available.

I love the giant drums of beer and glass bottled coke throughout the shop as well. Makes it feel less like grocery-esque for a quick grab n' go. 

The deli is a phenomenon. Friendly for the typical sandwich aficionado and the vegan\/veggie types. The flavors and combinations are endless and the deft hands of the deli staff move the lines faster than other places. 

Gotta love the niche humor and accessories\/toys for sale. Always good for a gag gift or oddly celebrated white elephant party in July. 

Something for everyone here. Grab a six pack to go, a draught with friends or snackage for the road. 

Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit.

Only difference between this location and plaza midwood is the outdoor seating. Gotta love those nights out in southend sitting outside. Another perk? There's an apple tree in the courtyard. You can pick the apples and eat them! There is usually an apple picker next to the tree, so pick some when they're ripe! Really fun for friends and family visiting from out of town.),(I finally made it to The Common Market after working in walking distance for the last couple of years.

Not a problem though I will be back...the staff was super friendly recommended a unique drink celery soda (think it was Dr. Browns) I will also recommend it... similar to sprite without being uber sweet.

-Scoop Salad: Just $5 for a scoop of chicken salad (my fave) atop of fresh greens and some decent dressing options.

It's a hotel restaurant, after all.  I decided to eat here since I was staying at the Marriott and it was both convenient and had excellent reviews.  I loved the open kitchen concept and the fact that it didn't even smell one bit like a restaurant in the lobby or in the dining area itself.  Some NYC restaurants could learn from this place.

Service was great - our waiter was super nice.

The menu was fairly simple and had a good array of choices, but wasn't overwhelming.  My colleague and I decided to share a few plates and went with:

- Deviled eggs: very mustardy.  If you're keen on mustard, you'll like this.  I would get this again (but you only get 4... womp)
- Chicken liver pate: I order this pretty often at many restaurants I go to, but I thought it was very meh here.  A lot of chicken liver and not enough to go with it.  It also had an interesting consistency
- Pork shank - probably the worst thing I had that evening, honestly.  The pork shank was decently cooked, but had absolutely zero flavor or seasoning to it, it seemed.  We tried to compensate with the sauce, which I believe is Asian-influenced, but it tasted strange like burnt sugar.  I think I could kind of see what they were trying to get at with the sauce, but it just didn't hit the spot for me.

I'm a fan of the bar area at Stoke, however.  They're fully stocked with a nice selection and the seating is nice and comfortable.  Definitely one of the nicer hotel bars I've seen.

For a hotel restaurant, Stoke is actually pretty good... I'd definitely give it another try, but probably order something else.),(Couple of weeks ago, I finally went to Stoke in Uptown for a four courses Thanksgiving Feast.  What I like about Stoke: its open kitchen and sleek tables, craft cocktails and farm-sourced everything. 

My meal was fantastic, every course and every single bite. However, THE DOUGHNUT was the highlight of my meal.

The second clue that it was going to be good was when we noticed that there was no extra sauce on the table. ""These folks mean it,"" I said to my dining companion.

We ordered a couple of barbecue platters it is was more than decent. Finely chopped pork and beef topped with a sauce that was both tomato based and still had a good vinegar kick. I had mine with beans and Brunswick stew. A basket with four slices of excellent Texas toast was also delivered.

A very different Brunswick stew from one I've ever had before. While it's probably an old family recipe, it was mush (like an oatmeal texture) and had quite a lot of corn in it. Strange?),(This is hands down the best pork BBQ I've ever had and I like to consider myself an amateur BBQ connoisseur as I've eaten at every ""good"" local BBQ joint in almost every state in the South, and some not in the south as well.  Its one of the big reasons I moved to charlotte and everytime a friend comes in from out of town I make sure we go there and NO ONE is disappointed. 

I ALWAYS get the small pork plate, if you want to get the best part of it, make sure to ask for the BURNT ENDS, dont just order and hope to get some, but ask for them specifically, easily the most flavourful part of the pig.  

The sweet tea is magnificent (I dont trust a BBQ joint that doesnt serve it) The hush puppies are unbelievable, once again, probably the best ones I've ever had, and the brunswick stew is hands down some of the best slop I've ever had.

The staff is all very friendly and I'm my sweet tea never dips below the half full mark.  I just wish this place would get more business because everytime I go there there are 2 other tables of people there at the most, and the restaurant is very spacious, the last thing I want is for this gem to go out of business.),(I have to agree with Jeffrey C here. Great service, old-school barbecue atmosphere, but really really lousy barbecue. Low and slow is the way to go boys. Chicken tasted like petrified wood. barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with. Their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side. Even ribs that should've fallen off the bone were tough and harsh. Barbecue sauce way too heavy and vinegar and not enough heat. Presentation is a big cafeteria zero. The Brunswick stew was chopped up mishmash that looked really disgusting although it tasted reasonably decent. Hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising. Local yelpers let me down here, or y'all just haven't had much good barbecue. Tickets one star for service and one star for atmosphere. If they could find someone who can cook in that great smoker, then it might be a really cool hip place.)"

When they had time, the service was friendly and good but they needed at least one more person working the line this morning.),(Waking up on a Sunday morning with not a whole lot of nothing to do produces one result: late breakfast. Oh, what a joy it is to be starvacious in the morning hours and to fire up a Yelp search on the old iPhone and up pops Eddie's. A a breakfastular force to be reckoned with. Rumblin' tummies beware. Your hunger won't plague citizens for long!

It's a quaint spot on Sharon Amity with humble outdoor seating, bar seating, booths and tables inside. No cockamamie and kitschy decorations either. Just plain old diner fare. 

Seated quickly. Every table was packed, but we managed to score a booth only after 10 minutes. Not too shabby. 

The Southern Scramble is a deep-fried force of culinary nature. Two large chicken breasts, fried, atop crispy biscuits and a smattering salty, porky, and thick gravy. Throw in a handful of handcut fries and the morning just turned into a snooze fest. Such an incredible meal. I felt like I was hit with a tranq dart afterward. My wife had the french toast. Thick cut and packed with spices. Amazing. 

You could say I'm a fan. I'll definitely be back for breakfast on weekend mornings that can only be spent at a booth, snarfing on a Southern Scramble. Viva Eddie's!),(I have eaten at Eddie's numerous times, it is a great place to go for lunch for a mixed group, there is bound to be something on the menu to please everyone. My very first visit to Eddie's I had a rueben, it was delicious, it has never been as good as my first visit.  A must try are the fried oyster appetizer and the she-crab soup.  

Sunday, we went to the Ballantyne location, sat at the bar and had a rueben and a bloody mary.  It was average.  Average service, bloody mary (zing zang, not homemade, simple lime garnish) and sandwich.  French fries were hot, so it does pass the french fry barometer.  With tip my bill was $20.  I don't know if I want to pay $20 for average.

Look at the photos of Eddie's  of the rueben, then look at my photo of my rueben, not the same.),(Solid breakfast spot! The service was quick and efficient! I got the corned beef eggs and hash. The corned beef hash was more like hash browns with corned beef thrown in, it was good but not a favorite by any means. I'm giving them four stars mostly because I couldn't stop eating my breakfast partner's chicken and biscuits. Ummm wow, something I would never think to order, but it was effing delicious. The chicken was seasoned well, the sausage gravy was awesome, and the biscuit was really the perfect icing on the cake so to speak. If I went back I would order that and plan not to eat for the rest of the day!)"

Taking two seats at the bar, we ordered a couple of local draft beers and a platter of nachos. The beers were served quickly, the nachos arrived an appropriate time later.

I wasn't impressed with the barbecue nachos. Too many chips, not enough toppings. The few bits of shredded barbecue meat on there were very dry. I would not have these again. I don't feel right dinging them for it though.

Next time, I'll go for a plate of their famed barbecue.),(Made it in for an early lunch and was astounded at how packed it was. A sea of biz casual gents at every table, bar seat, high-top and even a few waiting. Not the common tale for a lunch crowd, so I was intrigued to try me some BBQ. 

The space is rather large. Tons of tables in the main dining area, two separate bars with ample seating and even a private dining area with space for about 25-30. 

The service was very snappy. Quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Our server seemed to be able to carry 3 pitchers at a time and still pour sweet tea into our glasses! They've definitely hired some seasoned employees. 

I ordered the open faced brisket sandwich. A gratuitous portion of brisket on texas toast. Very simple, which I appreciate, and no frills to try and mask the flavor of the meat. Just some grilled onions on top for good measure. The brisket was tender and smoky. It's impressive to me that a place in Uptown is actually smoking their meats. Not an easy feat and only attempted and successfully executed by a handful of joints in town. My hat's off to QCQ for this one. Served open-faced, but easily picked up and smashed into your face for the more adventurous. 

The beans were ok. Nothing special. I did appreciate the inclusion of Neese's sausage. Standard for some bacon or a few bits of pork fat in beans, but sausage? That's a high-five all around. 

Great job, QCQ! I'll be back!),(Mmmhmm. Sit me in a comfortable but modern atmosphere, and give me a toasty plate of pulled pork barbecue with two delicious sides and I am one happy camper. 

Queen City Q is certainly making its way into my top choices for barbecue in Charlotte. And that is no easy task! 

Allow me to break it down for you...

The space: It's quite expansive with lofty ceilings, a large bar, and plenty of high tops and booths. And, they validate parking in the adjacent lot, so no worries about paying an arm and a leg to get your Q! 

The service: Quick, efficient and friendly on all accounts.

The barbecue: Succulent, tender pulled pork in a delicious sauce. Plus, there are four sauces on the table, so whichever region of 'cue you long for, you can make happen. 

The sides: I selected the mac 'n cheese and edamame and corn salad. Both were equally tasty...especially the corn salad. Hey - I needed something healthy-esque on the plate! 

The price: Super affordable and fair. Considering that Uptown offers a dichotomy of restaurants, upper crust or quick sandwiches, Queen City Q is a nice respite in regards to both price and environment. 

Viva la Q!),(So I love BBQ....and to have a place in town is very C O O L. 

I dropped by one night and the place was dead, so I tried last night (Friday) and was pleasantly surprised to find the place filled with all kinds of folks.

I decided to sit at the bar and order a BBQ plate...............wow, was I surprised.

The bartender, as nice as she was, wasn't the best one I've ever had....good intentions, but slow on delivery mainly because she was both serving customers and getting drinks for the dining room.

Decor wise the place had been repainted, but other than a few items on the wall and some old wood covering up some parts of the room, not much different than previous tenants.

When dinner arrived, it was a H U G E amount of pork!!!!!!!!!  Not the mention the 2 sides added to a mound of food I could not even attempt to finish.   But it was good!  Very good.  All of it.

So I ate what I could (this plate is big enough for 2 people) and took the rest home.

FYI:  Like Brixx next door, they'll pay for your parking upstairs (a plus)),(We had a lovely late lunch here.  
One of the best Chicken Quesadillas I've ever had, even though their salsa is watery.   

My boo had the fire roasted buffalo wings...  
Take that fire roasted statement literally.  They packed quite a punch, but he was able to customize his order and split flavors of the wings.  He got the other half barbeque wings.  Which were no where as spicy hot.   

Note: Everything seemed to be ala carte, so there are no fries, salads and barely any garnishes served with anything.  

Pink lemonade was nice too.  They had a full bar and local beers!  
This place is next to the Levine Museum and in the center of everything. The prices were decent and the menu was huge.  Yay - To outdoor patio seating to enjoy the Charlotte sun, city vibe and people watching.),(So I'm in the Queen City on business and I'm scoping out the top restaurants\/bars on my Yelp Mobile App.  These folks had great reviews and they were close to my hotel. That's a win, win for me and off I went for and early dinner. I had such a great time that I stopped by for lunch on another day and also visited just for an adult libation or two or three.  I'm delighted to say these folks earned four stars from me.

I loved the draft list.  Expect a nice selection of local brews.  Whoever selected the beers also made sure there was a nice mix of styles of beer.  That's not always the case and I was impressed.  There is also a substantial bottle list.  Nothing goes better with Q than beer so the start of a good meal is in place.

As I was traveling by myself, I sat at the bar for all of my visits.  That was good news for me because most of the time my bartender was Andrew.  He was friendly and efficient and a great conversationalist.  He also knew his beer. He would have been perfect if he looked like a Victoria's Secret model but hey, I guess you can't have everything!

On one visit I tried the DEVILED EGGS & BACON as an appetizer.  For $4 you get 4.  They were delicious with a big spicy kick.

On different days I tried both the SAUSAGE and the BRISKET.  You know the Q is really excellent when the meats can stand on their own without any additional sauce.  That was absolutely true here.  Both were tender and juicy and packed with flavor.

As with most Q places there is a long list of sides.  I sampled the CORN MAQUE CHOUX. HOUSE CUT FRIES, EASTERN NC BBQ SLAW, and HUSH PUPPIES. All of them were fine but OMG the corn!  I think I moaned when I tasted it.  That's embarrassing! 

Expect a platter here with two sides to cost you $12-$16.   The portion sizes are just fine and you'll be full.  When I visit Charlotte again it's certain that I will return.),(Came here hungry and left happy!! I tried the Big Q that includes 3 meats and I chose the chicken, brisk and ribs. The chicken was moist and delicious, the ribs were tasty but the brisk was very dry and glad their was hot sauce. The meal began with mac and cheese poppers, then the potato fries. 

The place was clean and nice location and I recommend this place. Enjoy the place as I did.)"

I've tried a few different creations: Ferrero Roche & Cheesecake with walnuts and chocolate chips, and another creation - Pineapple with shaved coconut and strawberries.

Okay, enough ranting. I got a simple platter with a breast and a wing plus mashed potatoes and cole slaw. I'm not going to have their mac & cheese in the airport, but at the retail outlets, it's okay. The chicken was quite moist but there was a lot of batter. The fixin's were okay. Nothing special

   ---   ---   ---

Like any insanely obsessed foodie, I used my $8 in-flight WiFi to look up the Charlotte airport's food options so I could have at least an hour to decide on what I was going to eat for lunch. I was going to go with the Mongolian Grill until I noticed Bojangles. I have a friend from North Carolina that has pimped Bojangles for years, so my choice was pretty obvious.

I took about 617 people movers from my terminal to BoJ's, and my conclusion is this: while it's really good, I wish it could be slightly more about quality than fast foodish. The idea of warm biscuits and fried chicken is so obvious, it made me wonder why more places are not based around this heavenly combination of comfort food. 

It was delicious, but the lack of a 5th star is due to just a bit much on the layers of fried breading before reaching the chicken.

You take those biscuits with Publix or PDQ fried chicken? My God... I'd be flying to Charlotte just for a stop at BoJangles.),(Pretty good cajun chicken sandwich for breakfast but a little bit greasy.),(05.17.11

I wish I weren't such a sucker for fried chicken.  But, I am.

And Bojangles makes it with the best of them.

The skin is breaded, and fried, but it still manages to maintain moisture through the meat.  And it's juicy and crispy.

Like!),(Chicken and biscuit were stale and dried yet terribly greasy. The grease wasn't yummy fat goodness but rather cold, solidified trans fat horror. Yuck! Between Bojangles and Brookwood Farms BBQ at the Charlotte Airport besides a nose-blowing employee at a Starbucks there, Charlotte has left an awful impression on this traveler.),($4.99 for 4 chicken strips, crispy fried juicy white meat with a sweet BBQ sauce and a big flaky biscuit!  Yeah!

I promise to start eating healthier tomorrow...

Uh, maybe?),(Forget KFC!
Forget Popeyes!
Forget Churchs!
Bojangles is where its at!
Located on Concourse B at the CLT Airport...
Ordered chicken n biscuit on my layover!),(I saw this restaurant exiting the terminal,  with a name like bojangles i HAD to try it. I wasnt completely sure what to order so i asked a few people and they recommended the chicken rice bowl. 

I ordered the chicken rice bowl and sweet potato pie. It came out really quickly and i also grabbed several bags of hot sauce to go. The chicken rice bowl is so good!! It comes with a large portion of chicken, dirty rice, beans and cheese on top. Its pretty salty though, so you might get bloated if you eat this before you fly. The sweet potato pie had a nice flaky cinnamon crust and a decent amount of filling.

Great way to try a Charlotte chain if youre bored of the other airport food.),(During a delayed layover at the Charlotte airport, my fella and I decided to grab a snack while we waited for our flight. We ordered a cajun filet biscuit and a chicken leg to share. I have heard about Bojangles, but never came across one in my travels until yesterday. 

The biscuit and chicken were very tasty. The sandwich had the right amount of spice and the chicken was extremely moist and the portions were great. The filet was really meaty and juicy. The chicken leg was also moist and flavorful. Definitely a nice little stop if you're in the area. I hadn't planned on eating during my wait, but after seeing everyone sitting around me with a Bojangles box, I just couldn't resist the enchanting call of the siren.),(Stopped by Bojangles for the 1st time when we had a layover at Charlotte Airport. I'm not a big fan of fried chicken, but thought I'd give this ""southern"" joint a try.

It wasn't bad. Didn't taste a whole lof of a difference from KFC. I didn't like it as much as Popeye's. 

Price was very reasonbable, and there's plenty of seating next door.),(JIGGA JIGGA, CALL THAT GIRL BOJANGLES"".... YUM-O CHICKEN!

I was SO excited to see Bojangles in the terminal during my 2-hour stopover from Miami and I'm really glad I tried this place. 

Notes:
 
-The biscuit was humongous.... but it was the most boring biscuit I'd ever eaten. So much so that I actually gave up halfway through eating it and let my brother have it. It wasn't creamy or buttery or flaky enough for me. It was just.... bleh... a biscuit, and I probably could've made better at home.

-Loved the sweet tea, because I'm a fanatic for Southern-style sweet tea. 

-The chicken was the real prize. Crunchy like popeye's, tasted like it was marinated in Cajun spices too. We didn't order spicy but there was just this kick in the back of your throat from the chicken that made your mouth say ""Hello"". 

-The fries were REALLY salty. I thought side dishes were supposed to help balance out the salty flavor between the main dish (the chicken)? Um no, each bite was like a flavor explosion that I didn't necessarily enjoy all too well: spicy chicken, salty fries, sweet tea, repeat. Oh wait, maybe that's where the bland biscuit comes into play? 

Anyhow, the prices are almost reasonable but definitely more expensive than any other fast-food fried chicken joint. The largest family dinner (I think it was an 8-piece with sides) in order to feed a family of 5 cost us $30 and we were still hungry afterwards. So you're telling me it would've cost us $60 to satisfy us?

Would I go back? Yes. Would it be worth it? Probably not. 

My advice: Skip the mumbo-jumbo hoopla sides and just order the chicken and a sweet tea. You'll feel much more fulfilled.),(Yes, I know it's a chain and housed inside an international airport, but I don't care. Forget KFC and even Popeye's. Bojangles fried chicken tops them all. How can you beat a perfectly breaded and fried cajun filet biscuit? Answer: You can't!),(I had an unexpectedly lengthy layover at the Charlotte airport during my recent venture to the midwest, and discovered there was a Bojangles just down the corridor from my connecting flight.  I wasn't too hungry, but I couldn't pass on the chance to sample some of the ""famous chicken & biscuit,"" as the signs proclaimed.

I opted for the chicken tenders, or ""supremes"" as Bojangles named them, along with a biscuit.  The chicken was excellent.  The breading was crispier than I'd imagined, and gave it a nice crunch.  The chicken was juicy.  The biscuit was good, but definitely not the best ever (that spot is reserved for Popeye's).

Bojangles is definitely a worthy stop for a meal or even a snack if you find yourself at the Charlotte airport with an appetite and little bit of time.),(We had a layover in Charlotte so my bf wanted to try their chicken. We got an order of their biscuit steak sandwich and their chicken sandwich. Both were just okay, but I wish we got the fried chicken instead.  However, my bf said it looked like it's been sitting there for a while. My favorite part of the meal were the fries which had Cajun seasoning on it.),(Wasn't sure what to expect of this place, but man I'm glad we tried it! We were disappointed we couldn't find a Chick Fil A to try but I think this was just as good an option. We got the supreme (spicy) chicken tender combo with the seasoned fries, and also a biscuit and sweet tea! The fries were soooo good. They were nice and hot when we got them too! I was slightly disappointed in the biscuit cuz it wasn't as buttery as I expected... But oh well lol. The chicken tenders were good, but not as spicy as I was wanting - the amount of crunch and moisture they had made up for it though. The employees at this locations were extremely nice, which is rare in an airport. I'm sad we don't have this place in Washington.),(Our flight from LA to Pittsburgh had a layover in Charlotte, North Carolina.  We had about an hour to wait, and I decided to get a snack as dinner in Pittsburgh was going to be late.  I saw a bright yellow sign that said ""Bojangle's chicken"".  There's no Bojangle's in California (or not to my knowledge) so I ordered a 4-piece snack chicken tenders with a small season fries.  The snack came with their famous biscuits.

The chicken was tender inside, crispy outside but a bit salty.  For airport food, I really couldn't complain abut the taste or the price.  Thumbs up for me, and as Michelle P said, if the airport food was pretty tasty, I can only imagine what an actual location would be.)"

Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)

Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches\/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time. 

My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option. 

I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone. 

Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!

Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks.

My wife had a great meal of chicken kebabs, which she called tasty and moist. I had a gyro platter. Both came with a very good Greek salad that was heavy on feta cheese and had a good dressing with a small plate of grilled pita breads. My gyro was pretty good as well. The fries were tasty though I thought a little underdone.

Service was good and attentive.),(Like others, I was on this side of town a quiet Sunday morning...you know, when almost nothing else is open in Charlotte unless you want to positively battle the church crowd?! I was also jonesin' for a gyro and The Mad Greek (previously Hugo's Diner) seemed to be a convenient choice. 

Inside, this place is definitely not much to look at. I doubt the booths or floors have been changed up since the late '80s and there was a sticky quality to the place. However, it's a diner. It's open until 4 am on the weekends, I half expected that. 

Service was very friendly from the (owner - I believe) slingin' Greek greens in the kitchen to our server. As with the decor, the menu is straightforward. It's also worth noting that they do serve breakfast all day - pancakes, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, etc. 

Since it was almost noon, I went with the classic gyro sandwich. A well made, soft but toasty pita filled with gyro meat, tzatizki, onions and tomato. I decided to forgo the fries and snag a greek salad for $1 more. The gyro was tasty, warm and just what I was looking for. The salad was fine but the Greek dressing wasn't my fave...even though I'm certain they make it in house. 

So, with good service, good food why not 4 stars? Well, others may disagree with me, but I found it a bit overpriced for what I received. The gyro, while tasty, wasn't giant like the others I've had. For example, Steak & Hoagie shop serves up a gyro for a bit over $4...here it's moderately sized and $7.95 (including fries). Hubs and I had two gyros, one with a side salad and one with a dinner salad and it cost us $27 with tip. That seems a bit steep for just a couple of gyros and salads. Regardless, if I was in the area and seeking a gyro, The Mad Greek would be a decent stop.),(I checked out the Mad Greek today.  We were on that side of town and it popped in my head, thanks Yelp!  I dont' know if I would drive and make a special trip, but if I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again.  

In the light of day, it didn't seem so clean to me.  If you are the kind of person that looks at sanitation ratings, it might not be the place for you. I didn't see what their score was and I do not care, I will eat anywhere, but I know what people like when they think of a clean restaurant.

On the upside, our server was pleasant, we ordered chicken sandwiches on pita.  It was served hot and was very filling.  It would be so much better for you to eat at the Mad Greek instead of fast food anyday.),(Had the lamb chops and they were great. I would definitely stop here again if ever in the area.)"

Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. 

This place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit\/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....

You can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. 

Service is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. ""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!"" Pretty much always my thought process. 

This place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. 

Thanks for the quick and entertaining lunch\/service, Kabuto!)"

You may not be in the market for a 3, 4, or 5-star meal, but it's always there. Warm plates of comforts foods, friendly service, tons of regulars, and the same decor for the past 20 years, most likely. 

Located in one of the office buildings, this spot is your typical ""Meat and 3"" type of joint. I'm pretty standard with the marinated chicken over rice, greens, and usually another veg. Is it amazing? No, but it's just right. Kind of like something you'd had for a family gathering that has plenty of love put into it. Always filling and affordable, too. As a sidenote, I've had the vegetable soup a few times and it is truly incredible. You typically don't think much of it in other cases, but do yourself a favor and try Nick's. Truly delectable. 

It's the typical cafe where you pay at the counter. Some old candy rests within the glass case that hasn't been touched for year and a cool old cash register rest atop. This is the kind of place that brings back memories of diners I would go to as a kid with  my grandparents. Old cushy seats, patterned carpet, and odd, hotel-esque art on the walls. Ha! In a sense, it's perfect. Viva, Nick's!)"

We've used this place for a specific brand of dog food that doesn't seem to be available anywhere else.

I'm not sure how often I'll be back - this market is smack dab in the middle of a part of Charlotte where there isn't a nearby Teeter, Lion or Bi-Lo. I'd say that Whole Foods has nothing to worry about.),(A great local, organic and healthy food store...I have been to both locations in Charlotte and even though he store on Independence is much closer to me I prefer this store on South blvd. it's bigger and has a greater selection of prepared foods.  You will love this place for theiraw foods prepared by amazing raw food chefs. Try the tirmisu!  They have a great selection of organic produce and gluten free products.    Need vitamins?  great prices and an incredible selection - if your not sure what you need just ask one of the expert staff members they are very knowledgable. This is the place to come for bulk items - flours, nuts, dried fruits you name it they probably have it in stock.),(If you dig organic, healthy and\/or natural foods you must give Healthy Home Market a try. I concur with other reviewers that this is a great place for specialty products, as if you try to fulfill your entire grocery list here you'll either a) spend a boatload of money and\/or b) you'll miss a few things that you may need (toiletries, certain branded foods, etc). 

Beyond the pretty produce, natural dog products and sweet selection of local eggs, my favorite section is the pay by pound nut and snacky section. I know - I find the most unhealthy place in Healthy Home Market and latch on to it. But really, the chocolate covered nuts here are incredible -to the point where I'll be nomming away on them in the car during the 5 minute drive home. Don't judge me. 

So, yes, I fully appreciate Healthy Home Market's presence in South End. It beats the drive to SouthPark for Eathfare (and in a few years, Whole Foods) plus there's a real community feel about it when they host plenty of free tastings and events. Yay for Healthy Home Market!),(So I adore organic..........but most times I'm lazy and won't adopt the lifestyle 100%......heck, not even 25%, but for Thanksgiving I did want to get a bird that was hopefully raised and killed in a manner that was better for me that from some mass production turket farm.......was the bird I bought here different..........I have no clue, but the butcher behind the counter was very nice and helpful with my questions.

Throw in free samples and a person giving massages near the register and this place is something worth checking out if only to see all the foods you never see in say a Harris Teeter.),(A decent alternative to Whole Foods- but way less organized with a much less knowledgable staff. We got all of our organic fruit here, coffee, some meat, oils and a defuser, almond milk, you know... the essential stuff. Pretty basic, right? It seemed that the butcher had no idea how to use a scale (asking my boyfriend how much the piece of meat weighed- WHAT? We're just magic and can read meat scales), the lady near the coffee grinder needed to ask someone else for assistance when we wanted to grind our coffee beans, and when I wanted to look for coffee filters I seriously had to stare at the display for 10 minutes before finding them hiding at the bottom. Oh well. The food is actually very good- delicious filets, vegetables and fruit, from what I have eaten so far. I live across from a Harris Teeter and I honestly don't know if Healthy Home is worth the trip.)"

I said one $ and sort by highest rating. After excluding a fast food place, Malaya was the top. Now, I know NOTHING about Malaysian food. In fact, I'm not even sure I know where Malaysia is on our big planet. But after eating this meal, I need to find out more.

I stuck to the specials menu and ordered the ""Malaya Roll"" which turned out to be ground chicken in a pastry roll that was fried to a crunchy goodness and served with a sweet chilli sauce. I ate all of it and then dipped the garnish cucumbers into the sauce too.

For my main, the Hong Kong Duck Soup caught my eye. When it arrived, it was a massive vat of dark colored broth with noodles, veggies and probably half of a duck sliced into bits. It took a little while until it cooled enough to eat but when it did, OMG yum. Deep flavor in the broth and the noodles were just perfect al dente and the bok choi was nice and tender. The duck. Oh, the duck. Tasty, meaty and all too many more adjectives that need to go here to describe a great meal. Check the picture I posted!

I opted to skip dessert, instead finishing the Chinese beer I had ordered.

Great service sitting at the bar. My only complaint is not their fault - my cell phone could barely get a 2G signal. :-(),(Oh, Malaya Kitchen. How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. 

A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench\/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. 

For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. 

We started out with the Roti Telur. ""Pancake"" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!

My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. 

I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. 

Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! 

The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. 

Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!),(Man, my Asian peeps can THROW DOWN with the food here! Good lawd!!  I had this place book marked for awhile and my newly graduated from 8th grade son and I looked at the menu and pics on Yelp of course and he decided here.  Great choice, cause, damnnn, it rocked!  Now, I'm dieting but I tried a tiny bite of all dishes and can personally attest that the food was very very good.  The fam gave it 5 stars with no hesitation as well.  

Location is fine; in a popular large strip mall called Arboretum but must say when they designed the parking spots imo, they are a bit tight,  but still, its a good area and parking is ample. 

The restaurant interior while not very expansive is overall fine and seating layout is decent enough so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of each other. The bar takes up a fairly large part of the interior. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful.  They clearly answered our questions on the dishes and checked in and topped us off appropriately. 

The fam started with the ""roti canai"" app which is a simple dish with a single large piece of fried naan served with a side coconut curry.  But the flavor of the curry was far from simple, it was Excellent.   The curry was not sweet,  just very flavorful with the requisite coconut taste. The main dishes were 1) Mongolian chicken, 2) General tso chicken,  and 3) Char kway teow stir fry wide rice noodles.  All were delish and the tastes exceeded what the eyes initially conveyed.  It was shark eyes all around!

Overall the restaurant takes indian\/thai\/chinese flavor traditions and offers dishes that embody combinations in an otherworldly ""fused"" way.  We wholeheartedly suggest that you try this place out!!),(Malaya Kitchen is exactly what the Arboretum needs, a restaurant that isn't vanilla.  I saw the ad in creative loafing and it spoke to me.  So I wanted to go check it out.  A  modern restaurant, the portions are generous, $8 lunch specials. The waiters are all friendly and helpful.  A great little find to get your Asian on.)"

I love this location is 24 hours as well. Always nice for a late night visit when we have friends in town and don't have enough of (insert superfluous food item).

The layout of this location has changed dramatically with all of the updated construction and flooring going in. It looks rather nice and is a huge improvement over the previous. 

The new frozen and dairy section is very impressive. Individual coolers for each category of frozen foods, cheeses, milk and so on. Much easier to navigate and the lights are super bright. The ice cream section seems even larger than before!

Some of the cashiers could be a little more peppy and smile every now and again, but no complaints. The self-checkout is legit. 

Thanks for being in the neighborhood, Harris Teeter!),(This location of Harris Teeter is not our favorite but it is not bad.  I'm not certain but it may actually be a tad bigger than the store we normally go to.

This location has decent produce and a hot\/cold bar.  The meat and seafood selections are fine and the tuna steaks we purchased were very fresh tasting.  All in all, its a good example of a Teeter,  but I would say the parking and getting in and out is not that great which is probably our major gripe about this location.)"

Both burgers handed to you in a paper bag, fries in cups in the bag, and wrapped in wax paper. Ordered the Cali and my wife ordered the Adam -- veggie style. The Cali...damn. It was awesome.

The Good: Service is still solid albeit quiet and the sushi menu is creative and tasty. There's a item for everyone and if you seek some interesting rolls, you can likely find them on the menu. Plus, the place is conducive to large groups ready for sake-bombing. Don't forget the complimentary valet!

The Bad: The prices were already a bit high for the market but over the past few months, Nikko raised the price of many of its rolls and specials. While the increase was only a dollar or two each, that certainly adds up on the final bill. 

While the price increase is a bit irritating, it's even more so due to the fact that the rolls are significantly smaller and not as fresh. Sad panda. I was also pretty disenchanted by the soy sauce splattered menus and funky scent coming from one particular booth. No, it wasn't us. We showered.

Nikko is still a fair place to check out, but for me the quality has gone down as of late.),(Nikko is a Charlotte establishment when it comes to sushi.  With modern design and a sexy layout in lighting even the bathrooms are nice.  You pay for all this ""high profile"" look and feel for this place by the pricing of the sushi, which is very good, but I feel like I'm paying NYC prices in NC????

With DJs playing certain times of the week and Joanna chanting more sake bombs and dancing around with a boa this place is a little of everything.

The wait staff here is always good, but not very engaging.  Parking involves valet or parking in the deck, but the deck is a real pain....I don't like that aspect of this experience.  What is good is I can catch the light rail down there from the center city which is a real plus.  People watching is very good here and the place can get loud.  So for an overall good time while getting your sushi on, this is the place for you............and me.),(This is a perfect sushi restaurant for a business lunch or wild and crazy birthday dinner. You can sit at the sushi bar or at regular tables and booths. You can stick to pretty traditional fare like a California roll, or venture to try something more exciting like squid or salmon. I love, love, love their Gyoza ( a delicious dumpling you have to try or you haven't lived yet) and the Stained Glass martini, which combines amaretto and midori among other liqueurs and somehow tastes fantastic! You haven't gone to Nikko's unless you have gone for a celebration of some type and ordered Saki bombs, because this is when Nikko herself, clad in an outrageous outfit of some sort topped with a cowboy hat comes out with a musical flourish and does shots with your entire table. Usually she has a tambourine which she insists on keeping time on your bottom or hers. From the art and design just in the bathrooms, to the club thumping beats the dj drops on the weekend, it's a blast and I will continue to keep going.)"

Drink choices were limited with a pepsi fountain. I didn't see a diet non-caffeine option so I ended up with a bottle of water.

Would I eat here again? Possibly. The Bistro 7 (also in the food court  and reviewed a couple weeks ago) was a healthier and tastier option.),(There really are limited options in the SouthPark food court. You've got your typically delicious Chick-fil-A, your myriad of Asian inspired fast food, a few sandwich options, and Showmars. I'll agree with Jeff S that this location also doesn't have the full effect of the standard Showmars Restaurant. But no worries. 

The Good: The order takers are friendly, food comes out lightening fast, there are typically daily specials, they now have whole wheat pitas and they seem fine with substitutions (fruit for fries, hooray!). 

The Meh: The gyro is fine - it's nothing special but certainly fills the void, the tzatziki could use a kick and the quality of the food suffers just a bit as it's in a mall food court. 

Overall, if you're a starvin' Marvin in SouthPark mall, Showmars will suffice just fine!),(My french fry barometer registered a ""what the what?""

Someone finally walked to the register to take my order. She started by telling me that I couldn't order anything with meat from the Red Burrito side of the menu. The truck had just arrived and they haven't unloaded yet. Seeing how long it took for everyone else to get their burgers, I went with a bean burrito. It was just meh. The chips and salsa that came with it were meh. It also took awhile to get. Meh, meh, MEH.

I have to say that I was absolutely shocked at how good AZN was. Made it in for lunch, somewhat late in the afternoon, and there were only a few tables filled. We were a little leery of what was to come, but I couldn't not give this place 5 stars after our experience. It's pretty rare to have an experience that really delivers on all fronts, but AZN pulled it off. Even on a slower afternoon. 

Started with miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, and some of the veggie dumplings. Miso and house salad are pretty standard. Just right. The veggie dumplings were just great. So simple, a great combo of sauteed veggies and a fantastic ponzu\/soy sauce for dipping. We actually ended up ordering a second order (which never happens to us). We were pretty hungry. 

I ordered two rolls of sushi. Really simple -- California and Spicy Tuna. Both were fantastically easy and familiar. The presentation was hilariously cool. On a plastic bridge with some art made of sriracha. Check out my photo. 

We ended up ordering dessert, too. (Again something that doesn't happen often) and it was nice. Tempura Cheescake. Pretty much what you would expect. How could you say you don't like fried cheesecake? I don't know either. 

Ended up coming in again for lunch soon after and got to sample a menagerie of other menu items. Started out with the Firecracker and Enter The Dragon rolls. Both are much more complex, but incredibly flavorful. The Firecracker was by far my favorite. It's pretty pricey, but well worth it on occasion. Sashimi isn't something I'd typically order, but AZN's sashimi sampler packs a punch. Amazing cuts of Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. Love the arrangements and a nice bonus of a Cali Roll, too. The ceviche was great, too. Light, citrusy, and a mixed with a healthy portion of veggies. 

The decor isn't overbearing. Not over the top like some other sushi places I've been to. I think what I love the most is the seating choices. Booths, bar, hightop, tabls, upstairs, sushi bar, private dining area. So much space and really gives you options for each visit. 

Service is very professional and attentive. Each server I've had was polite and incredibly patient. Big plus.

Bartenders are nice...quick with a drink and refill and they have average pricing.

Place is very small, but they have some nice outdoor seating...if you can get around cigarette smoke floating around you the entire time you are out there.

It is also the only 2am bar in this part of the city, so it is the place of last resort when I feel I MUST HAVE ONE MORE DRINK before the sun decides to rise 3.5 hours later *grin*.)"

Zoes Kitchen is a relatively quick, healthy meal option in the Metropolitan\/Midtown area. It will probably take you longer to find a place to park than it does to get your food. Again, my rule of thumb for this parking deck is bypass the first floor and drive up to higher level. Not worth the hassle or frustration. This deck and 485 = #alloftheroadrage in Charlotte. Also, keep an eye on the front for street spots. (I can never park there... I don't parallel park)

My good friend Paul is apparently the ""Norm"" of this location. He comes here so often that all the workers know him by name. It's like having lunch with a celebrity.

I can't seem to stray away from the Greek Salad. I always add chicken and drown it in the dressing. It's healthier than ranch or blue cheese... I can be excessive, right? I can usually split the salad in half and make two meals out of it. I love that they have a hibiscus green tea drink option. Although, they also have Mr. Pibb and I love the laid back, less ambitious sibling of Dr. Pepper.

Zoes is probably more like a 3.5. I still feel like it's a little pricey for what it is, but the workers and service at this location are great. They also have a nice outside dining area. So, I'll round up to a 4.),(This location serves us rather well. Never anything too complex or difficult to work with on a any front. The service is friendly and fast, the food is always consistent, and they have great outdoor seating. 

My favorite things to get here are the steak rollups, braised white beans, and the hummus\/pita plate. I don't normally order anything with steak in the name, but the addition of mushrooms in these bad boys make it a nice entree. Paired with the rosemary braised white beans make for a nice meal. Also, the hummus and pita plate is a great app or even a meal. 

Biggest gripe about this location, and the age-old tale of The Met, is the parking situation. Forget about the adjacent garage for their side of the shopping center. Either look for an open space on the street or just park across the street in the Target garage. Much easier. 

Zoe's is A-OK in my book. Even with their crazy ""o"" in their name that my computer can't seem to locate. Cheers!),(This is a good lunch spot for somehthing healthy and quick. The food is fresh and I really enjoy their slaw - no mayo here YEAH - I'm not a huge fan of the mayo.   I don't adventure out much here for me its always the protein plate - chicken, slaw, and onions.

You can definitly tell its a chain but they keep the place clean and the service is great...if I'm in the area I'll stop by - but I won't drive outta my way to come.),(After dropping by Zoe's a few more times, I think it's completely fair to award them additional star. Why? Let me 'splain...

1) Super fast, super fresh and delicious. This goes especially for their Turkey Stack - a grilled sandwich filled with turkey breast, mozzarella, feta spread, lettuce, tomato, sourdough and rosemary oil. Get yourself a Turkey Stack.

2) The employees are really, really sweet. Forgot your fork? No worries, they'll snag one for you while you start on your sammich. 

3) Nice outdoor seating. People watching can be enjoyable at the Met - trust me. 

4) Their desserts magnanimous. I haven't indulged in one yet but the cookies and brownies look ah-mazing. 

Definitely on my short list for a tasty lunch when I'm zooming around the Met.),(So when visiting stores in Metropolitan complex Zoes Kitchen is a good place for lunch and a nice alternative to 95% of the places in town.

They serve good food that is good for you.  The Kebobs looks great but for this visit it was a turkey sandwich which was very good.

Salads are also tasty.

For dine in patrons they bring your food to you.   During warmer months outdoor seating is nice, though a ton of traffic goes by which isn't so nice.),(I'm a big fan of Zoe's kitchen. In fact, I was here earlier today. My first Zoe's kitchen experience was in Virginia. I ordered a sandwich, soup and a drink. To be honest, I wasn't blow away by it. This was a few years back.

Anyways, moving to Charlotte I decided to give it another go since I was aiming to eat healthier. I ordered the chicken kabobs and they were outstanding. Then I went back and ordered the steak kabobs and they too were outstanding. Good size portions with salad, rice, and flatbread. Delicious. 

The service is fast and super friendly. There isn't a long wait for your food to come out and it's always solid. I can't remember going to Zoe's and thinking that it was ever different. 

Prices are reasonable and the dining area seems pretty spacious. They even have outdoor seating. There are a lot of intriguing menu items that I have yet to try, but don't worry I'll be back. And if I don't end up getting some variety of the kabobs I'll try something else. A+)"

My sliced brisket plate had a great tangy\/smoky flavor and the meat was perfectly tender. No knife needed here. The 'tater salad was crisp and cold, well mixed up with a few pieces of potato in there. The baked beans are clearly not straight from the can. They have a BBQ zing to them as well as pieces of meat and onion - yummy.

The sweet tea needed nothing, though the staff kept refilling my glass and pouring in more and more crushed ice.

Nk2gNrMDZa9_7gmT3W-zjQ,"Thai, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.3372336,-80.7566391,Thai Taste at University,105,3.5,"(Met an old friend here for lunch yesterday, Saturday 4\/25.  We started a Thai iced coffee (for her) and a Thai iced tea (for me).  I had informed our server of my food allergies, of which he took time to notate down before heading of to the kitchen.  He did say that Thai Taste is more than willing to accomodate by omitting the ingredients I couldn't eat and substituting items that are more appropriate.  I asked if TT made their own curry pastes, and he said yes (and no, they do not use shrimp or shrimp paste in their curry pastes!).  I had spotted the daily specials board located outside by the front entrance that included soft-shelled crab (2 pcs.) with chu chee sauce and jasmine rice for $16.95.  (Mango sticky rice and Thai fried ice cream (!) were also featured.)  Our server said that if we did not like chu chee sauce (a coconut-based red curry sauce traditionally used with seafood, such as scallops and prawns\/shrimp), we could opt for basil or ginger sauce.  I was also eyeing Pud Thai (their spelling) or green curry with tofu.  When I told Tina about the crab special, she ooh'ed and ah'ed, so we decided we'd split an entree.  Our server, however, had bad news- he was just told he'd have to go to the grocery for a crab run as the kitchen had just run out! Tina decided she would get the Larb with chicken (basically a spicy dish of ground chicken lettuce wraps), and I ordered the green curry.  Tina started her meal with celery soup, a soup I'd encountered at almost every Thai venue I've eaten at, but this version contained grains that looked like barley.  She thought it was good.  

We didn't have to wait long for our entrees.  Her larb with chicken came out first, and what a beautiful sight it was!  It smelled marvelous, too, and Tina dished out a generous serving for me to try.  My green curry, with carrots, peas, green beans, bamboo shoots, broccoli, and tofu, was not far behind; The bowl in which it was served in was smaller than I've seen elsewhere, and without the usual accompaniments of soup and eggroll (due to my food allergies), $7.95 for a basically a cup of green curry and jasmine rice was pricey.  I think the kitchen added broccoli to sub for the eggroll, as it was not listed as an ingredient in green curry.  (For anyone with a mustard allergy- broccoli is listed as one of over 300 plants within the mustard family.)  I have to say that this green curry dish ranks as one of the best I've ever tried (mirroring Phoenix's Thai Elephant's on Adams and Thai Hut's, Mesa's Palee's Crown's, and Scottsdale's Tottie's Asian Fusion's)!  I could drink the green curry elixir straight  from the bowl!  It was that good!

Clean, comfortable setting, great food, awesome service, and bright and clean women's restroom- what more can one ask for?  Ah, maybe an ample supply of soft-shelled crabs?  Haha!  No worries there, as the menu seems very promising!  Great QC spot for Thai!

I'll be visiting again before flying home.  (Actually, I wasn't able to go back a second time, but my sister took her coworker to lunch soon after, and they both LOVED the green curry!))"

There's no place to eat your sandwich, there are a couple of benches and a few chairs out front, so you are lucky to grab one.

My favorite is when you get lettuce on a sandwich they put two different ones, so it really gives it a nice texture and they aren't stingy with toppings, everything is equal amounts.

The store itself is great too, nice beer and wine selection, not huge, but decent brands. Plenty of chips, cakes and candies!!!

My favorite sandwich is the chicken torta, french bread, chicken, lettuce, tom, onion, black bean spread and extra jalapenos!  Yes, please!!  And I also love their bologna sandwich, it's sliced thin with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  I can't believe I order a bologna sandwich, but I have many times!!

Perhaps I was thinking that they would be a bit more ""Greek"" or middle eastern. Instead, they're a sandwich place and their ""hook"" is that they serve it all on pita breads as wraps.

They have a pretty good (i.e., cheap) special, which is a 7 inch pita with drink for $4.99. It's pretty hard to beat that these days. However, I went with the 9 inch wrap combo, which includes a bag of chips as well as the drink. (They have a Pepsi fountain, plus sweet and unsweet tea.)

I've been on a corned beef kick lately, so the Reuben seemed like an interesting and different option, since I've never had one of those as a wrap before. While it had the right ingredients - corned beef, swiss cheese, thousand island dressing and, yes I know, cole slaw - and the right flavor, I was left hungry. There was only a small amount of meat in the sandwich and it was quite ""drippy"". I'd probably skip this one next time. I'd also recommend skipping the pickle, which I found entirely too soft and not worth the effort of eating.

The other option is that they have an ""all you can eat"" bar with premade and wrapped sandwiches - hot and cold - as well as pita pizzas and nachos and a short salad bar section. With a drink, that would have only been another dollar. Perhaps that would be the better choice if you're a ""Hungryman"" like myself.

The franchise owner was the one working the counter and he was very friendly and engaging, checking to see if our sandwiches were okay and apologizing for being out of roast beef (which I guess means it's at least fresh). The restaurant was clean and well stocked.

Bonus: they have signs advertising the place as a wi-fi hotspot, but I didn't have time today to check it out. Perhaps when I come back, and yes, I'll be back.)"

For an array of sandwiches, super affordable breakfast platters and a damn tasty gyro, Sammy's is sweet. I strolled in on a pleasant Friday afternoon and took in the fairly diverse menu. The counter lady\/order taker was quite pleasant and even offered some suggestions for me as I was a first timer.

I imagine many of the patrons I saw at Sammy's have been coming here for years. YEARS. And I fully appreciate that...have to trust a place where loyalty is important. 

My gyro was pretty tasty - the meat was super tender, the pita soft and lightly toasted but the tzatziki could have used a bit more of a punch. I was not a fan, however, of the side I chose, potato salad. Sammy's make theirs with a heavy hand of yellow mustard.

Nice selection with a few of the usual items - scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, biscuits, grits - and a few that were a bit more unusual including a huge tray of oysters, large shrimp, meatloaf squares and a good few things made with sweet potatoes.

I particularly enjoyed the shrimp (with a New Orleans remoulade, but would have preferred a classic cocktail sauce) and the sweet potato au gratin. Sliced salmon was good too, but I didn't really feel like waiting for the toaster to toast.

Service was okay with a waiter who refilled Diet Coke often but coffee not as much. I think he was maybe disappointed that we didn't go all in for the refillable mimosas or bloody marys. We're not all booze drinkers, ya know?

This was my first time checking out the brunch menu... and it will not be my last. My friend Dre and I are not very good at making decisions, so we put our menu decisions in the hands of our server. By the way, she was just fantastic. She suggested we do Shrimp & ""Grits"" and the Beets Benedict. 

OH.MY.WORD. The Beets Benedict... I would like to write a love song for that dish. Absolutely amazing. The crispy beets, poached egg, creamed kale and red pepper relish... wow, tremendous combination. The Shrimp and ""Grits"" is actually done with creamy polenta. So good. We ate every single morsel of food.

I went with my go to cocktail here.. the Nightshade Martini. Our server suggested the Saint's Cut for Dre. Great cocktail. Bulleit Bourbon, St. Germaine, Prosecco, citrus juices. Not super bourbon-y. 

Great staff, amazing food. This place just keeps getting better. (Spoiler alert: be on the lookout for brunch to transform to a buffet style this weekend)),(OK, let me first--- spill the beans, I heart the chefs at 5Church and Nan and Byron's, I can't help it- they are both dreamy and sarcastic, so therefore I can't resist their charm or their poblano cheese dip French fries, so sue me.

I have been multiple times, brunch, lunch and dinner, the other day I ordered a cup of coffee.  I couldn't believe how good their coffee was, that alone gets the fifth star from me.

There were three of us and we ordered a large Cobb salad to share,  they divided it for us in three tiny bowls.  That was way beyond the call of duty..  

So excited to hear they serve breakfast, ready to go check it out and drink some more coffee!!  Naaaaah, I'm gonna drink booze.

It was so loud in there so you had to yell to your seatmate but besides that I really liked the vibe and decor of the place. The service was really awesome and someone was always there when we needed them either to fill our water or to check in on how things were going. 

I loved the popcorn they had out at all the tables. Since I was starving it was great at holding me over until the appetizers made their way over. We started off with the deviled eggs which I wasn't a huge fan of but my dining companion loved them. We got the poppers based on the recommendation of Nikki W and they were really good! For dinner we split the meatloaf which was tasty along with the cheesy macaroni and cheese goodness that we got as a side.

For dessert they had a brownie sundae with peanut butter ice cream. That thing did not disappoint. It could have used more ice cream but when one of the waiters noticed we had a lot of brownie left he even offered to bring us more. I really appreciate that level of service!),(We went to Nan and Byron's last night and sat in the front room. We were absolutely starving and glad they could take us right away with no reservation. 

I ordered the meatloaf, which had sriracha ketchup and it was delicious. For my sides I had peas and carrots and mojito fries. Yes, that's right. Mojito. Fries. It's like a hint of lime chip but a little more sophisticated. Yummy.

I gave it 4 and not 5 stars because I asked for Brussels sprouts since many yelpers were raving about them. She said they were seasonal. I asked if there was a comparable vegetable equally good right now. She said no and said since it's Sunday they didn't really have much. Your restaurant is open 7 days per week, no?

Can't believe it has taken me this long to check it out so I can write this review. Seeing as how this is one of Crown Town's more popular spots, the time was nigh to get in and sample the fare. A small, and plain building. Not too much going on inside. Just tables, booths, high-tops, and bar seating. Such close quarters that the aromas from the kitchen fill the dining area and inhabit your clothes. Not a bad characteristic. 

First off, I have to express my love for these guys having Northcoast's Scrimshaw Pilsner on draught. Not a common tale for most places in town. This alone sets the bar apart from the rest. I can recognize that tap handle from anywhere....5\/5 for this. 

Ordered a smattering from the menu. 

Cheese plate: 4\/5. Camembert, bleu, honeycomb, fig spread and two others I can't recall. Served with grilled bread. No combination that was undesirable. 

Falafel: 3\/5. Rather plain, and the greek yogurt on top seemed to add to the plainness. 5\/5 for presentation, though. 

Pork Bun: Unreal. 5\/5. Perfect texture, flavor and presentation. I was absolutely thrilled. 

Corn Rissotto: 4\/5 Sweet, and wholesome. Nothing over the top, but just right. A rather large portion, too. 

Gnocchi: 5\/5. Just perfect. Amazing flavor and all of the mushrooms were wonderful. I didn't want it end. The addition of the chicken was fine, but could have gone without. 

Dessert: Apple cobbler with seasonal ice cream 3\/5. Just nothing groundbreaking here. Presentation was fine, flavors were fine, but just didn't seem to have that special element. 

We made it in at 5:40, right after they opened. I would emulate this again. Nice having an early dinner and missing most of the crowd. Service was incredible and so fast. Very knowledgeable about the menu. 

Very much looking forward to returning!),(I can't get Good Food out of my mind so yes you guessed it just like the name says this is ""Good Food"".  I really love the whole experience from the moment I walked in.  The hostess was friendly,  the atmosphere was great dimmed lighting gave a romantic feel but overall this place is just hip.  It's classy but comfortable and all of the staff will make you feel at home.  They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait especially on a weekend night.  I visited on a Thurs. night had to wait about ten minutes which was nothing plus I always enjoy checking out the bar in a new place.  The bartender was very friendly and did not go wrong when she asked my how dirty I wanted my martini on a scale from 1 to 5 umm 5 please and thank you for asking. Just when I didn't think my dirty martini could get any better yup you guessed it blue cheese stuffed olives I was already in heaven.  

Now for the food.  What is great about the food is it's served tapas style so you have the opportunity to try all kinds of dishes.  A few of the dishes that I thought were yelp worthy quail lettuce wraps, the gnocchi with brussel sprouts and cream sauce this dish was addicting I think I could have eaten the whole order all by myself.  I also enjoyed the steamed bun with pork belly.  Save room for dessert because the strawberry cheesecake is so worth it (unfortunately I think it was a special so hopefully they bring it back real soon!)),(Good Food on Montford is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  They have a changing menu that offers a wide array of tapas-style sharing dishes that can delight the palette of just about anyone.  Service is great, the atmosphere is lovely, and the portions\/value of the food is excellent.

On service - all the employees were very friendly and helpful with menu choices.  There was a small hiccup on our order and they comp'ed the dish without any hesitation and without even asking.  Our waters were full and someone was always around to see how we were doing.  

On atmosphere - it's tight, but not too tight.  The lighting is homey - not too bright, not too dim.  The noise level is just right - it's bustling and you can definitely hear how busy it is inside, but you don't have to scream across the table to talk to whoever you are with.  The tables are somewhat close together, but you don't necessarily notice the conversations of other parties, nor does it take over your own conversation.

On food - everything on the menu looks appetizing.  It was hard to choose just a few dishes between the two of us, but the waitress was helpful in telling us how much or how little to order and was honest about it when she thought we ordered too much.  Thus, the amount was just right.

Beef carpaccio - beef was sliced very thinly and was fresh, but the pimento cheese was very much overpowering and you couldn't really taste it.  Probably the only complaint.

Truffle fries - they ended up forgetting this until the end of our meal and comp'ed it.  The fries could have been hotter and slightly more truffle flavor... if I had to give any feedback.  

Gnocchi - holy.... best gnocchi ever, and a huge portion.  The flavor here was impeccable - a must order.

Steamed bun - a giant version of a steamed bun from any Japanese place. They give you a knife to cut in half.  I actually preferred this one over several other pork buns I've had around the US.

Mussels - a different take.  It's in a green curry base instead of the usual white wine and garlic base.  I prefer the latter, but this was still flavorful and a nice take on a staple item.

Banana bread dessert - this was a little bit too filling for us and not so much a ""dessert"", but it was still flavorful the macadamia ice cream was exceptional.

Would definitely return!  It's not good food... it's great food! (So  cheesy...)),(Third time's a charm for Good Food! Yes, we've tried to eat here twice before and both times the wait was astronomical (2 hours, 1 hr 45 min). So, that's the first tip for everyone - the folks at Good Food do not take reservations, um, ever, I think?

But onto the evening, inside GFOM is simple, understated yet elegant. There's a pretty and low key bar, a fair number of tables and wonderful staff. Hubs and I were seated within minutes and tried a sampling of dishes. Before I get to the eats, I will concur with others - I think the plates (small and large) are a bit on the pricey side. So, perhaps it's not the most fiscally responsible move to head here when you're super hungry as the portions are small. Food time...

Mixed green salad: 4\/5: A lovely salad, delicious and light with baby parsnips, cranberries and hazelnuts. Super light and a perfect way to start the feeding.

Smoked Salmon: 5\/5: I don't even really like (or order) smoked salmon and I loved this dish. The fresh, smoked salmon with egg, potato & capers with dill creme fraiche was a perfect blend of flavors. The little chippers were great! 

Seared Scallop w\/risotto: 3\/5: My lease favorite of the dishes as I was expecting more complex flavor. While the items reads beautifully, butternut squash risotto, shaved fennel & bacon, my scallop (there were 2 on the plate) was quite undercooked and lacked depth. 

Steamed Bun: 4\/5: Nom worthy. It's been a long time since I've had a steamed pork bun of this caliber. The five spice rubbed pork belly was perfectly tender yet crispy on the edges and I loved the hoisin & pickled vegetables.

Baked Cavatappi: 3\/5: A good baked pasta dish w\/fresh, gooey mozzarella. Coming from a family of very talented Italian cooks, I wasn't wowed by the sauce but I did really love the Italian sausage mixed in. 

Pork tenderloin (the only large plate we ordered): 3\/5: The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and intense with smokey flavor yet the fried mac 'n cheese triangles were underwhelming. I didn't taste much cheese! 

Pumpkin Bread Pudding: 5\/5: Drool. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order bread pudding because I get so disappointed when it turns out all French toast like. But this bread pudding was moist, bursting with delectable pumpkin flavor and topped with a gorgeous sliver of pumpkin seed brittle and some of the most delicious cheesecake ice cream I've had. Get it. 

Since the menu is eclectic and certainly inspired, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more good food from GFOM!),(I have visited GFOM four times.  I love the food, I think it is a little expensive.  Our check average was $66 without tip.  So, be prepared if you are one of those people that love to graze and order everything your heart desires!  Tonight I tried the pork bun and it was delicious.  I sometimes get hooked on an item in a restaurant and this is one of those times.  The pork bun was dripping with natural juices from the pork and hoisin sauce and then you would get a crisp bite from pickled veggies.  It was served on a cute little square cutting board, I would lift the cutting board to my mouth so it wouldn't drip down my chin.  YUMMY!
One complaint is they do not do separate checks, which in this day and time with computers, it's so much easier.  If you haven't been to GFOM, strap your wallet on and go have a great meal!),(Great place. Small place with great bar and outside lounge area as well. Little on the pricey side of $48 for one person but I ordered the chartruderie plate, Korean beef, glass of champagne and red velvet Twinkie. The chartruderie was average and didn't excite too much although it was delicious especially the foie gras with chutney but it lacked presentation. The Korean beef was out of this world!  Cooked to perfection, presented well and ate every last drop of it. The red velvet Twinkie was also different and well worth trying. Delicious and perfect for finishing the night with champagne),(So to wrap up a year long project in Charlotte, the team decided to hit up Good Food for our final team meal. I had been a few times and have enjoyed myself here and figured it was a good spot to celebrate everything the team had accomplished. We were able to score a table relatively easy on a Monday night and showed up with our group of 6. We were greeted promptly at the door with smiles and immediately brought over to a table with menus in hand. The servers were very attentive throughout the meal and I appreciate the ""joking around"" she was doing with the table as it certainly lightened up the mood.

We looked at the menu and we decided to order a whole array of dishes given the plates here are relatively small. That is something to note for people thinking of showing up in groups more than 4, is that sharing can be difficult so you will want to plan out how to share everything evenly. After perusing the menu, we went with the charcuterie board, the cheese board, carpaccio, falafel, pommes frites, the sautéed mushrooms, the garganelli, the gnocchi, pork carnitas, the steamed buns, the Moroccan spiced chicken sausage, fried chicken, Korean beef, and the scallops. We essentially ordered almost everything minus the seafood given the dietary restrictions at the table. The server was able to balance all the food as well as kept the drinks flowing with ease. As mentioned we ordered a few things twice because of lack of availability to share and focused on those that were extra good. The charcuterie board and cheese boards were nice dish to share with the table and was standard cuts across the board making it easy to eat. The carpaccio was DELICIOUS and had good flavor with the pimento cheese and we ended up ordering two of these for the table. The Falafel was good and the greek yogurt sauce was good but we ended with one helping as it didn't have a special kick or lacked that extra ""umph"". The pommes frites were good as well and standard fries with truffle oil which you obviously cant go wrong with. The sautéed mushrooms are absolutely delicious and I probably inhaled an entire plate by myself. Its just a simple clean dish with fresh herbs and sliced garlic but boy is it addictive. The garganelli was delicious with the home made Italian sausage being on point with the simplicity of the red sauce to it. We HAD to order two of this and it went fast. The Gnocchi is always a show stopper here and is really well made. It was another crowd pleaser and candidate for two. The Steamed buns are probably another top item and is better than some Asian restaurants I had been to. It's essentially a big pork bun and again a perfect candidate for ordering more than one order given the size. The pork carnitas was good but not something that warranted extra stomatch space so we moved on to the Moroccan spiced chicken sausage. It paired well with the tahini and we got a few orders of these as the meat was spiced and cooked really well. The fried chicken was good with the collard greens on the side and again another crowd pleaser. The  Koren beef was a good attempt at a fusion dish but ultimately fell short and the scallops were the same deal where it was good but not worth another pass.

All in all, this is a great restaurant with great service and certainly one of the better establishments in Charlotte. Some of the dishes are just really strong dishes with others being good. Definitely worth the visit so make sure to drop by)"

They were running a BOGO special last summer, which led us to try the place.  I'm a huge fan of spicy dishes, so I went for the Indonesian Peanut Saute Noodles with the Thai Curry Soup. The soup was nothing special, just a simple, spicy broth with some fresh veggies thrown into it.  I did enjoy my Indonesian Peanut Saute... I wouldn't exactly classify this meal as authentic Asian by any means, but it tastes great from an Americanized point of view.  The portions here lean on the larger side, so come here hungry!),(I don't know why, but I've had a serious crush on Noodles & Co. since my time at UW-Madison. It's always a solid, quick choice that leaves me full and happy. 

The run down:

The employees: Chipper and happy, always service with a smile. They are also really happy to take to-go orders over the phone - and even more impressive, my order has never been anything than what I've requested (and I ask for a handful of substitutions). 

The food: Fresh, hot and tasty albeit a bit expensive for what ya get. I usually go with the Japanese Pan Noodles. Delish.

The environment: It's definitely an eat & exit kinda place...you won't find super comfy chairs here! 

Yay for Noodles...I'll be back!),(Noodles and Company is a nice place to go if you're unsure what you want to eat. They have a great selection of options. And contrary to the title, you don't have to order noodles. There are a variety of different styles of dishes that are very distinct from one another. They also have great sandwiches, salads and soups. And they have a smaller and larger version of dishes depending upon how hungry you are. And they show you the nutritional information. 

I like this location too. The staff is friendly, the location is clean and the food gets to you really quickly. The pasta dishes aren't on par with authentic Italian, pad thai is not on par with an authentic Thai restaurant and so on and so on. But the dishes are tasty in their own right and the prices are reasonable too. 

Definitely a great option if you're hungry.)"

5Church is the swanky, cool kid on the block. The interior is beautiful. I can't even begin to tell you how many birthday\/bachelorette\/event\/-insert reason to celebrate- dinners here. I send people this way all the time. 

The menu changes seasonally, but there's also some longtime staples on the menu like the lamb burger and 60 second steak. In all honesty, I can't think of a meal here I didn't enjoy. My current obsession is the ahi tuna poke. The avocado, serranos, pineapple, soy sherry, it's just a great combination of flavors. The award for most surprising dish I've had in the past couple months here is the chicken adobo. Why do I say that? Well, I'm not someone who will go to a restaurant and order chicken. In my head, I can make chicken at home (I know, I know... not anywhere near restaurant quality, but still). I would order this chicken. It's packed with flavor and delicious. The Viper is my go-to cocktail. Lunch-wise, I love the Italian Hoagie and French Onion Roast Beef. Guys, it's like French Onion soup in a sandwich! And it's delicious. 

Follow 5Church on Instagram to see the latest pics of menu items. Parking- they offer complimentary valet. Make sure to bring some cash to tip! 

I'm a huge fan of Chef Jamie, Patrick, Alejandro, Ayman and the entire team. They do great work and their passion shows. One of the coolest things I've ever witnessed was a night out with some of the kitchen guys here. To hear them all talk about how much admiration and respect they have for Chef Jamie, it says a lot.),(Finally made it in for dinner! We've been jonesin' to try this place after hearing about it from friends and other Yelpers. It was slammin' on a Wednesday night around 8pm and the food, drink and conversation was flyin' all around. Every seat at the bar was filled, all of the high-tops, the lounge areas and pretty much every table. Definitely one of the premier places to check out. 

The art throughout the restaurant totally makes you think twice, buffalos and cherry blossoms, really strange lamps, incredible ornate wing-shaped lampshades over the bar and sweet mural of a $5 bill in the upstairs. The best, by far, is the steel tree near the hostess stand. It really stands out and blends well with the rest of the decor. It doesn't stop there. Check out the ceiling tiles. The ENTIRE book of the The Art of War is painted on them. Yep. I said it. You'll have to see if for yourself. So crazy. 

We started with the pirogies and goat cheese with spinach. Both were fantastically flavorful and perfect for a table of two. Pirogies were almost like Indian samosas with the spices inside. The dough was flaky and had a slight chew. The pea mixture on bottom was to die for. Definitely both worth getting again!

Wow. 5Church still has me astounded and still trying to find the right words for the ""60-Second"" Steak. I can barely describe the difference in texture from rare steak to crunchy, crispy and perfectly seared bottom. Each bite was a perfect savory balance hit with the tangy, malty, barbecue-y steak sauce resting at the bottom of the plate. I don't order steak, pretty much ever, but this has stolen my steak-loving heart. Goodness gracious, it was incredible. A fantastic NY Strip. I'm still having daydreams about it. 

The staff hoofs it. Up the stairs and then back down. Huge trays, drinks, server books...they never stop moving. All with a smile and very knowledgeable. 

Can't wait to visit again! Chef Jamie and the team really have something going here. Totally chic and swanky but with a casual appeal. Bravo, gents. My hat's off to you for a fantastic evening of flavor and fun.),(5Church is my kind of church, I could see myself being in the congregation every Sunday.  Shrimp & grits, breakfast pizza and crabcakes with poached eggs. Yes, can I get an Amen?  Pastor Chef Jamie is kicking ass.  Of course, Sunday isn't complete without bloody marys or mimosas, bases covered.),(As soon as Charlotte's council vote was made possible by the ""brunch bill"" pass (by the state legislature), I made my early reservation at 5Church. In another words: The so-called ""brunch bill"" allows restaurants to start selling booze at 10 a.m. on Sundays (instead of noon). So, we were there at 10 a.m in celebration of North Carolina's new Brunch Bill, because why not ;)

I was in the mood for some Southern comfort food, so I ordered the Fresh Buttermilk Biscuit. It was fluffy and served with wild mushroom and truffle cream and topped with over-hard egg.
- Convenient location in Uptown.
- Friendly, courteous staff.
- Love the black and white decor. 
Four Yelps),(We stopped in for lunch on our last day in Charlotte and were happy with our selection.

The Great:  
+  $10 lunch special - any sandwich (other than the lamb burger), fries and a drink.  I got the chicken souvlakia sandwich.  Delish.  The fries were crispy and fresh and the bottomless iced tea was a nice touch.
+  Our server.  I don't remember her name, but she was short and blond and completely awesome.  Friendly, funny and helpful.  Boom.

The Average:
o  It was a bit dark inside and with the place being so large it felt really empty.

Overall, a solid 4-star lunch experience.),(Round two! I came again last night after making an Open Table reservation for my boyfriend and a client who was in town from San Francisco. I was impressed by the food last week and decided to give it another whirl- interesting menu options and great ambiance. We were a little late (10-15 minutes) but they didn't blink an eye- our table was ready for us and we were greeted right away by our server. Definitely an improvement from last time! We ordered the mussel appetizer (delicious) and I had the scallops (was torn between that and the NC flounder) and BF got the famous lamb burger. Everything was delicious. Our server was super nice and delivered everything quickly, wasn't obtrusive yet friendly. All in all, great dinner. I think our company enjoyed it very much, too.),(Great service and nice atmosphere but the food is major lacking in flavor.
My salad was so heavily dressed with balsamic drizzle that it overpowered the rest of the salad. My short-ribs were falling off the bone but had very little flavor, I just couldn't finish it, and I  rarely don't finish a meal.

UPDATE: I got a nasty message on yelp from an employee. Please don't patronize this restaurant. I now changed my star rating.)"

Seating: None, unless you count the five chairs facing the cash register, awaiting food. 

Service: Smiley and helpful. Speaking a bit of espanol helps but probably isn't necessary. 

Food: Al pastor tacos son deliciosos. Perfect amount of onion, cilantro and tender pork. Plus, the tortillas are well-made and surely crafted in house. The barbacoa taco was well flavored, spicy but strangely super duper orange...I ate it anyway. The green salsa is perfection. Get some. 

Beverages: There's a case of everything from juice boxes to bottled water to Jarritos. 

Price: Affordable but not dirt cheap. Surely it depends on what you order...my dining partner ordered up shrimp fajitas which came out in a giant box filled with everything under the sun. That, my friends, is a good value.

Gracias, Fonda Mexicana El Paraiso.),(OK, so I can barely drive by this place without stopping, I go today and meet one of my friends, I am excited that I am with someone so I can order more food and share and maybe, just maybe, try something different than the Al Pastor tacos.  So I order, 2 Pastor tacos and chicken enchiladas.  My spanish is muy malo, but I knew when she said ensalada that it wasn't a good sign.

Tucked into the Toringdon shoppes, it has the nice neighborhood-y pizza place feel. Just a few booths, small bar seating, a few hightops and tables. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing groundbreaking but certainly reliable in a pinch. 

We made it in at dinnertime and we were one of three groups. Our server was nice and, I think, the only one on the floor at the time. We ordered a veggie calzone, 6 wings and a side salad. It took close to 25 minutes for our food to come out, but it wasn't a huge deal. Just wonder what it would be like if it were a full house. 

The salad was pretty weak with a hint of veggies, wilted lettuce, and bleu cheese. The bleu was made in-house and was pretty good. The wings were great. Barbalo (buffalo and bbq) and had great flavor. I'd come back on Thursdays when their wings are .50 each. The calzone was ok. The veggies inside were pretty lackluster and the marinara was pretty bland. The dough\/crust they use is good, though. Great flavor and cooked well. Just could use a little improvement on the fillings. 

I think the rest of their menu is probably good and I would order something completely different next time around. 

After our experience with what we ordered, I won't be rushing back but would consider it again if we were in a pinch for some Za!)"

Mike D argues and says it's the green sauce at Viva Chicken. The battle continues.

Rule #1: make sure to check in on your Yelp app. They have an offer for free chips. I mean, your queso is going to need a bag of friends. And let's face it, queso is a must order. I like everything here, so my orders are all over the place. I love the empanadas and elote loco (corn). On Mondays, you can get a Three Amigos burrito and a drink for $6 (I always get ground beef). Taco Tuesday is one of the best deals in the city with $1 tacos authenticos. The nachos are the hidden gem menu item, they're massive.

I love their salsa bar. Salsa bars just make everything better, it's science. You can place pick up orders and pay online to speed up your to go process. 

Only downfall of this place is the parking situation. The lot is small and it can sometimes be impossible to find a spot. Be patient, your queso and salsa bar are worth it.),(The dudes from Three Amigos have once again stepped up their game and brought some killer food to the QC. This time, the focus is on traditional Mexican street eats and the fare is on the rise to becoming a more-than-regular spot for us. 

Came in on a Saturday before noon. The space is still being outfitted and decorated, so it has a bit of a feel leftover from the previous biz. I couldn't care less. The magic happens behind the counter and in the kitchen. 

The high notes:

Pupusas -- If you've never tried a pupusa, you're missing out. Thick, fried dough, veggies, cheese, and pressed flat. Incredible. It may look small, but don't be fooled. It's filling. 

Arepas. Filled with shredded chicken and some of the tastiest veggies I've had in a long time. The chicken had a flavor that was mild, yet pungent. The juices that came from the chicken, which I'm assuming was made in a pressure cooker, permeated the bread and almost made into two separate items. It didn't last long on my plate. 

Empanada. The crispy dough filled with even more cheese and veggies was equally amazing. Textbook execution. 

Tacos Autenticas. Perfect. Chicken, white onion, cliantro. That's all, that's all you need. Perfection. 

Guac. What else do you need to know? It's GUAC. I'd eat it every day of my life. The chips are seasoned, too, which is a nice touch. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Sabor. I'm excited to see how it builds out and becomes more of an Elizabeth staple. I'll be back soon. Next time: Burrito.),(I could tell you about my latest girlfriend but there's nothing interesting. She's sabor.

I could rant for ages on why I don't like Sabor very much but I'll try and sum it up.

Let's start with the good, though. The food isn't the worst thing I've ever tasted. The portions are pretty decent sized. And the girl serving me was both cute and super super nice and helpful. A total angel! The place is all about the salsas and it has some pretty decent ones.

Now on to the bad things. FIrstly, this region of America seems clueless on what Mexican food is. These are supposed to be real tacos? They're not. They're only slightly more authentic than the likes of Taco Bell. They have a few authentic elements but they're extremely Americanized. All the little local taco places that are serving up real Mexican stuff go unnoticed, and then this place, aimed at college kids, white people, hipsters, and basically non-Latinos, gets all this credit and rave reviews. It's not the rave reviews that get me, it's the implication that it's ""real Mexican."" Nah, it's not. It's half and half. Somewhere between. It's on the right track but there are places that are all the way down that track in in the station and serving up the real thing, and they get almost no press or attendance from all these people. It was so packed out of the door and it's so beloved by the Charlotte locals and young people. Some were loudly discussing how this is the exact same stuff they ate in Mexico. It's not! It can't be! But okay.

And Street Grill? Really? In Mexico that would be a joke. It's so not ""Street.""

Anyway, I don't hate it. I really don't. And I wish them well. It's a little expensive for me and not Mexican enough. Lol.),(I bookmarked Sabor awhile ago when I was still living in Charlotte but I never had the chance to go.  While in town visiting this weekend I decided to give Sabor a try. I'm a huge fan of Three Amigos and was really excited about this place. 

The restaurant was pretty empty when I walked in. I ordered up the tofu burrito but they didn't have any tofu ready so instead I got a veggie burrito. 

The restaurant itself is nothing much to look at. You go up and order at the front counter and there are booths against the wall to eat at.  They had a little salsa bar in the back which was cool. 

The staff here was very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can watch them cook your food. I decided to get my food to go. The queso wasn't very hot, my burrito though was huge. I enjoyed the zucchini that they put in the burrito but overall there really wasn't anything special about it. The chips were just like Three Amigos and are always awesome  The hot green salsa is my favorite, and their mild salsa is also super fresh and tasty.

I would give this place another shot and maybe try more of the Latin street food dishes. It just didn't wow me like Three Amigos.),(A couple of colleagues and I decided to meet up for a casual dinner at Sabor Latin Street Grill.  Back then, there was a ton of trolley construction, so parking and stuff could be a little difficult.  Not sure if that is still the case.

Anyway, the place was PACKED.  Know why?  Because it was Taco Tuesday!  I had no idea about the $1 taco specials here until I showed up at a packed house on Taco Tuesday.  Seems like a pretty darn good deal for dinner if you ask me.  I didn't choose to get any of the $1 tacos since I wanted some other ""speciality"" ones.

There is no waitstaff at this restaurant - you pick up your food and find a place to sit.  Theres a decent number of tables and booths available, but you may have to wait\/stalk a table when its busy.

We got a side of guacamole which was very fairly priced and came with unlimited chips.  Fresh, well made guacamole that probably could have used a teeeeeny more salt, but whatever.  

I got all my tacos ""Autenticos"" - cilantro (YUM), diced onion, and a lime wedge - just the way i like it.  I got the grilled steak and al pastor tacos, which were not part of the deal.  They were well seasoned and the meat was tender, but I wouldn't call this super *authentic* tacos.  Probably the best you can find in Charlotte, but I've had better tacos elsewhere.  The good thing about Sabor is that they have a crazy amount of different salsas and hot sauces you can put on your taco that definitely spruce it up.

I got an elote (grilled corn) as well and I wasn't a huge fan.  I'm spoiled by the delcious elote back in NYC.

I also recommend getting a Jarrito.  I always get a tamarind Jarrito at every taco place I go to for some reason.  Yum sugar.),(Sabor makes me happy.  $4 Margaritas on Fridays and big vats of homemade guacamole, I can't even drive by without my car turning in the parking lot.  Super nice staff.  Love everything about this little neighborhood joint.)"

Way better than anything you'd get from a certain ""king"" or a red headed lady. Made to order, great toppings and good sides.

If you sit by the window, you get a great view of the ramp with the Charlotte skyline in the background.

One complaint. $8.99 for a domestic draft?),(For an airport burger, this is pretty good. I got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids, and it was good. Cooked just right, big, juicy, tons of crispy bacon, and on a nice potato bun. They also served it quickly, which was a plus when in between connections. The tater tots are also great, especially with their smoky bacon mayo sauce. Just a heads up that this burger will hit your stomach like an anvil, lol, so I wouldn't plan on doing anything physical for a few hours. :)),(Day Two (and final) of my non-beef burger binge closed with a bite at Bad Daddy's.

The Frenchie has such promise: a very salty turkey patty covered in oozing brie, sliced apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayo and the phone number of a local cardiologist. This is supposed to feel healthier, ain't it? The flavors work, remarkably well, and I wolfed down the 'wich faster than Albert Camus' literary protagonist's descent in to madness. (L'Etranger reference +1)

Three cheers for the slaw, which held a hefty dose of caraway seed (?) and a proper crunch. One cheer for noticing the seeds in the apple slices before taking a bite -- there were a bunch. Service was on point at first, then steadily waned as the meal progressed. Had to chase down the server for a check. 

I'd order the Frenchie again, but wouldn't necessarily clear a path to Bad Daddy's. Then again, it's an airport, and A-OK may be tough to come by.),(Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is a small chain located in Colorado, North Carolina, and South Carolina; approximately 23 locations as of June 2017.  According to their website, they first opened in 2007 in Charlotte, NC with a passion for hamburgers!  This particular location was located in the Charlotte International Airport in Concourse C, Gate 4.  

I tried their Breakfast Burger (basic burger topped with ham, fried egg, bacon, and American cheese); burger patty ordered medium.  YUM!  

Tip:  Give yourself at least an hour before your flight departure.  The burger took about 30 minutes to make.  

ENJOY!!),(Two words: Bookmark it!
Take it from a bad-@$$-foodie who lives on dine-ins, takeouts. Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is one of the best restaurants that you'll find at any airport. This one is located at Charlotte Airport ""CLT,"" concourse C to be exact. 

While waiting for my flight back to Philly, I grabbed an outstanding All American burger, with a side of tater tots. An American style Wagyu Kobe burger ($4 upcharge) with ketchup, yellow mustard, shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles. The melted cheddar ($1.09) was delicious compliment to the burger while a fried egg ($1.49) dressed the top. 

What could be better than this burger?

It can get crowded (as it is the best spot to kill time), but the wait is worth it by comparison. The service is definitely airport-quality (a.k.a. sub-par). The decor is kinda out-of-the-box, but it's a nice change of pace from what you typically encounter in airports. And there's plenty of TVs if you're into sports or watching the news.),(I booked a red eye connecting flight , I had been up since 3am, and by the time I landed in Charlotte, it was 9am and my circadian rhythms were telling me it was lunch and I wanted chicken wings. 
Minutes prior to connection:
28 minutes- I was starving, went to Big Daddy's and told the waitress about my morning chicken wing fixation, and she told me that she would check with her manager since wings aren't normally on the breakfast menu. 
27 minutes- she came back and sweetly told me that the buffalo sauce wasn't prepared, but they would be happy to prepare naked wings with hot sauce on the side. Go for it, and by the way, my flight is boarding in 13 minutes. 
23 minutes- naked wings no hot sauce. oops, says waitress, they forgot hot sauce!
22 minutes- hot sauce appears, can I have the check?
21 minutes- check in hand, here's my credit card. Were the wings good? Yes, thanks (medium size, piping hot, well seasoned, crispy)
20 minutes- here's the receipt, thanks for stopping by. No, thank you for accommodating me! Scribble tip and signature and run to my gate, which is boarding. Wow, she even gave some wetnaps for the road!
17 minutes- at gate, boarding, I have 30 seconds to wash my hands and not make my neighbor hungry
15 minutes- I'm the last straggler at the gate, door closes. Nap ensues from food coma.

And that, my friend, is how waitresses earn a 50%+ tip.),(Love this place - great burgers - best of any airport I have been to.  When in Charlotte Airport, which I am in a bunch becasue I fly US Air, this is my go to spot.

You will notice this restaurant in the wing becasue it is almost always busy.  Expect to wait or cozy up really close to someone at the bar.  The interior is whimsiaclly decorated with old comic books, posters and ample TV's.  For those on the run, they have a quick service counter to the left of the opening.  Music is not overpowering.

The menu is all burger bar with very few salads.  For those that don't eat cow there are other options like turkey burgers and chicken burgers.  Their are a number of composed burgers with ingredients based on theme.  For those that like to build there burger there are a plethora of options from white cheddar to applewood bacon to fried eggs. 

I have never had a bad meal here even if I was eating a turkey burger.  You can even eat paleo here becasue of all the options.  I will say the only dissapointment are the fries.  That not withstanding, it is always a safe and quite tqasty bet in the airport.

Until by next flying gastronomic escapade, dine fine.),(I came here on the recommendation of Bruce K. (reigning Duke of CLT Airport).  I suggested this place when I was in town and I was glad he did!  For an airport this is a pretty good burger bar!  The meat was pre formed, but still tasted fresh and was cooked to order.  The bun was very soft and griddled to give it a little texture. I liked the amount of toppings - not too much, but just enough to add some contrast.   The standout was the side of tater tots, they were some of the best I have ever had!   They were addictively crispy and crunchy... finished them before even starting my burger. I dipped them in the Bad Daddy sauce and was in love!   I should have gotten a bottle of the sauce to take home.  
The menu includes salads, sandwiches and a bunch of other indulgent foods. I want to try the location outside of the airport as it has a bigger menu and I would like to experiment with the different topping combinations.),(I'm not sure why I chose this spot for breakfast on a Sunday morning at Charlotte's airport, which has seemingly large dining choices.  

In any case I was craving breakfast, and when I think of Charlotte I think of some decent home cooking.

Sadly the meal and service at Bad Daddy's was the quintessential bad ""airport terminal"" dining that one dreads - large bland overpriced portions not cooked that well, with slow service.  

The bartender seemed cool enough, but even though his bar wasn't busy, or the dining room, the room capacity looked pretty large. 

Whatever the case, it seemed like my scrambled eggs and bacon took close to 30 minutes to arrive, which is uncomfortable when you have a connecting flight.
The woman next to me had to ask for hers to go.

For $12 I expect a decent egg and bacon breakfast, but the bacon was to my misfortune burnt and tasteless, the eggs rubbery and bland, with the highlight being the fried potato squares.

It was a massive portion of subpar food.  

I would definitely try not to eat there again unless I wanted those fried potatoes.  The bar was pretty cozy too.

Sorry Bad Daddy.  It was bad, Daddy.),(Gate C, just a few steps down from where my plane let out was this place. The idea of a burger for lunch after having only 1\/2 a sandwich for breakfast - one that was dry over all.. was really a great idea. 

The husbeast concurred and we stopped in. I want to say the greeters were friendly, but they were carrying on a conversation and we waited about 30 seconds to be acknowledged, Once acknowledged, we were finally sat. The place was HOPPING! Busy, and I guess that's to be expected. The burger selection is huge - as to be expected from a Burger Bar. And the food is tasty. I had a make your own burger - with tots. HOLY CRAP the amount of tots they gave me was pretty large. The husbeast had one of their Bacon Cheese burgers on Steroids with fries. He loved it. 

The service was a bit slow, but given the amount of folks there, That could be forgiven.),(Oooh yeah, bad daddy. Wait a second, this isn't the start of Alex L's erotica writings. Lucky you.

Apparently this is a newish chain of restaurants throughout NC, SC and Denver. I was lucky enough to run into it during a transfer at the Charlotte Douglas Airport. I needed an excuse to eat like a bad daddy (this is killing me) and lucky for me...it was Cheeseburger Day. I needed to seduce my wife, who is a pescetarian to indulge in a burger with me. Even the strictest pescetarian (auto correct wants to make this proletariat which would also be an accurate statement) can't resist bad daddy's allure of a juicy burger and she proved to be no exception. ""OK, just don't tell the whole Internet.""

So we sat down, were handed a menu and both of us ironically fixated upon the vegetarian option which looked most appealing. It was a black bean burger with avocado, onions and some jalapenos. I asked our server about it and he suggested subbing the black bean veggie patty with a juicy meaty burger. My kind of guy! So I did and asked for it to be cooked medium. He warned me that it would still be pink in the middle which was purrrrfect.

My wife stuck with the vegetarian option, but made me promise to let her take a bite of mine. No problemo. I loved the fact that the burger came with a choice of fries, tater tots or coleslaw. I went with the tots. The burgers came out within 5-10 minutes, which is impressive since it was a pretty full bar \/ restaurant, but I guess they gotta keep it speedy at the airport.

I loved it. The bread was high quality, fluffy and the burger was cooked perfectly medium, which many restaurants seem to fail at. It was served with a side of sauce, tomatoes, onions, cheese and lettuce with avocado and onions on the base of it. The flavors came together wonderfully and the meat was seasoned very well. My wife and I exchanged bites and I loved her vegetarian patty and she seemed to enjoy the sinful delicious bite of my burger, breaking her normally pescetarian diet. ""You're not going to tell the whole Internet, right honey?"" ""This will be our little secret."" We exchanged a sultry look while continuing to chow down. The tater tots were fantasimal as well -- crispy, crunchy and delicious. Her coleslaw tasted fresh and healthy.

Entertainment was plentiful as a burner sat down a few tables away from us and attempted to engage in conversation with the beautiful single girl who was sitting  at a table next to us. He was trying to impress said girl with his burning man adventures and we listened with glee placing bets on whether or not he would try to get her # at the end of the conversation (he gave her a business card instead).

Final verdict: delicious burgers at an airport. Prices are very reasonable for the airport ~10-12 a burger (you can substitute Kobe beef for an extra $5 if you want). I suggest getting the black bean burger but subbing the black bean patty with a juicy meaty patty.)"

I had such an awesome time here this weekend.  The crowd is diverse which I liked and thank you so much for all the heaters and letting me enjoy the patio.  The patio is what really sells this place two fireplace lots of TVs and good drinks. The bartenders were very attentive even though the place was packed.  I can't wait to go back and grab some grub.  I think this is my new hangout.),(While Selwyn Pub can certainly fill up with a boat load of popped collared, frat boys of yesteryear, it's still a great place to grab a drink or a bite to eat...especially if you're mindful of when you go! 

The Good: The patio is one of (if not) the best in Charlotte. Fire pits, plenty of TV's, comfy seats and tables a plenty. The pizza is super solid - really, surprisingly, delicious! The service has always been friendly and pretty prompt considering how busy they get. Additionally, the beer list is decent. 

The Meh: Because of the said popular patio and plethora of games shown, this place can get SO loud, SO fast. When the clock turns to 11 pm or so on the weekend evenings, the bar can get exorbitantly crowded and obnoxious. This is when I feel too old to be in such bar. Also be aware that some of the booths inside have absolutely zero padding...that does my arse no service when I'm sitting there for an hour or two. 

Overall, if you can score a seat on the patio and take in a relaxing drink with a few buds, Selwyn Pub is a fine place to do so.),(Went here a few months back with some buddies of mine. I like the food here a lot. Heard great things about the pizza so we had some of that and pretzels too. And of course beer.

The food was pleasing. The pub itself has a cool vibe. Some tvs and decent service. It's a little more laidback than some other bars around the way. 

The outdoor area looked awesome. It was a rainy day when we went, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it, but I definitely want to hang out there. Plus I hear that Michael Jordan goes there sometimes, gotta run into mj!

The worst part about this place is the parking. Honestly if parking wAsnt such a hassle here I'd be here more often. But one of these days I'll be back. Cool place.)"

I've stopped in here on several occasions for a beer at the bar, dinner with a group of 12 people and lunch with friends. Each time has been a pleasurable experience. 

The staff does an exemplary job of seating, serving and managing the entire dining room. I've always loved the personalities of each staff member. Very easy to connect and they make the meal fun. Fast and easy. 

Draft beers aplenty at this establishment, folks. There are tons of local brews to choose from. My favorite? Abita root beer. Though there are not free refills, it is the best experience watching a frosty mug filled with delicious root beer on draught. Just a cool novelty to go along with your 'za!

The food, I mean....come on. It's pizzza. What's not to love? The crust is a bit darker and wheaty than others. A little heartier and stands up to loads of toppings with ease. The calzones, salads and sandwiches are great, too. Calzones are big enough to split for two people, or one ambitiously hungry diner. Everything was great. Also, splitting a large between two people always garners two slices to be taken home. A note for those who like leftovers: reheat in the oven. The microwave will kill that delicious crust!

Glad to have MM in Selwyn. Keep up the great work!),(Yay we have a Mellow Mushroom. Mellow Mushroom was one of my favorite hangouts in Raleigh so I was stoked to find out one had opened here. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the fact that they don't take reservations..we had a large group of fourteen people and we did end up waiting almost an hour and 1\/2 for a table. Luckily this place has a great selection of beer and a nice bar area. What really made up for our long wait and a bunch of cranky hungry adults was our waiter Tom I honestly don't think I have had this good of service in years. 

Tom put in our appetizers right away made sure we all had drinks split our checks a million different ways and trusted us with the gratuity. Even though seating is first come first serve they have really large tables that can seat at least 14 people together and its a great place for large groups. 

Now for the food. I've eat-in at other Mellow Mushrooms and the food has always been pretty good - I don't know if I was starving our what but my pizza was awesome. I had the red skin potato pizza it tasted like potato skins on bread it was amazing and I could only it one piece it was huge. OR maybe it was the pretzel appetizer that I was full from. All in all check this place out you won't be disappointed.),(In the land of Charlotte pizza, Mellow Mushroom falls squarely in the good, A-OK category for me. I've been to many a Mellow Mushroom - Atlanta, Charleston, Raleigh etc. and while this location didn't disappoint me, it didn't thrill me either. 

The Good: 
1) The decor is hippie kitschy with a really cool school bus in the middle of the restaurant. I want to eat in a school bus. 
2) The bar is pretty spacious and they have trivia on Monday evenings.
3) Beer specials *can* be good, all depends on the night you go. 

The Fine:
1) I've had a variety of pies from Mellow Mushroom and I've enjoyed the White Pizza and the Veggie.
2) Our server was on point with multiple checks and beer orders. However, we did ask for a few things off our pizza that were left on, though. 

The Not So Great: 
1) The wait can be astronomical - and it's not *just* because it's a new location. Folks flock to Mellow Mushroom. In droves.
2) That being said, there can be tons of kiddos in the restaurant. Now, I don't have any problems with little ones - they have to eat too. The environment can be bit too conducive for the wee ones to run amock and into tables. Not so great. 
3) It's a bit pricey for what you get. Since I don't love love love the pizza, paying $20 for a 14"" pie leans on the higher pie price point.

Will I go back? Sure...if I can have a low key evening at the bar with minimal wait!)"

So I brought my lovely wife here for dinner.

Chicken and dumplings to start was excellent. Lots of tasty vegetables in there. I can't remember the last time I had rutabaga. Yummy. The sweet potato soup was also good.

Ribeye steak (a $12 upgrade) was a terrific piece of meat. I loved that they trimmed the steak *and brought the trimmings on a separate plate!* Great cut and grilled perfectly to the medium rare we requested. I chose the crab cakes and they were excellent. Very well loaded with crab and little filling, a very nice taste and texture. Perfect crab.

Dessert was the only imperfect course.  I chose the apple cake and while the cake was very good, being topped with a rather hard ginger cookie made it difficult to eat. The deconstructed elderberry cheesecake that Mrs. chose was the better option.

Service was top notch excellent. Very, very good attentiveness, sincerity and appreciation for us choosing their restaurant. I love that Heirloom is focused on local sourcing and North Carolina vendors. From the meat to the sauces and the beers\/wines. I wish more places did this.

We'll absolutely be back.),(As mentioned this restaurant features North Carolina products & produce. Even the salt is hand collected on the NC coast! Honey bees on the roof top and pots of various herbs, spices, etc line the parking lot.

That being said, you might want to check the menu first for the day you're thinking of visiting. Not everything will be to your liking or may be a little too frou frou for the average diner. They will try to direct you to the 12 courses as a couple suggesting you share it, but frankly all the courses didn't appeal nor could I imagine eating so much food. Portions are small -- more like tapas -- except for the entree ones that are a little larger than the salads & deserts, but I was happy with 3 for me. And at most, 5 would probably do it even for a big eater.

The night we went, I had first a carrot & Bibb lettuce salad; second steamed clams; and lastly an amberjack course. My husband had the heirloom tomato; then the pork course; then a peach desert. I'm simplifying for space's sake... Each item came with many various garnishes and side items. 

Service was good.. A dining experience so a bit slower. I was glad we went. But I'm not sure I'd come there again.)"

This place is one of those amazing strip mall gems in Charlotte. It's right by another another QC SMG, Cedar Land. It's not fancy at all, but the food is delicious and the staff so friendly. Such a warm and welcoming vibe. 

I wanted to soup and vermicelli, so I decided on wonton soup and a grilled pork, shrimp, and fried roll vermicelli bowl. The broth on the soup was delicious. My noodle bowl, huge and delicious. I had enough to make two meals out of it. Christi and Rose both got child size phos. I laughed when they ordered them, but they really were the perfect size for the ladies. The boys decided to be boys and get extra larges. Holy. I could probably have drowned in one of those. The avocado boba was really good. Rose loved her taro bubble . I didn't get to try it, but it sure was pretty and purple-y. It's on my list to try next time. I was cold, so I went with just a pot of regular ole hot tea.

You'll pay a bit more for what you get, but your belly will be filled with tasty goodness. 

I've tried a few different lunch options here - two standouts include the caprese sandwich (get it toasted!) and the special of the day - asparagus, tomato and goat cheese quiche. Portions aren't gigantic, but they're certainly large enough for a plentiful lunch. Also, if you're going balls to the wall, try the pimento cheese sandwich, it's pretty delightful.

Today I got a medium ""Howie Maui"" which is their name for the classic Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. Well topped with plenty of both, it was plenty hot and it didn't take long at all. I do like quick service!

As far as the chain pizzas go, I would put Howie's ahead of Pizza Hut and far ahead of Domino's, maybe it's almost as good as Papa John's. But like so many things, pizza is a very personal choice. You likely feel different.

If I'm ever looking for a variety of pizzas for a party or a lunch, I think Hungry Howie's would be a good choice. But if I was just looking for a slice, I'd look to Luigi's.

Goodness gracious, check out my photo for the scale of a single slice. It's the size of a small planet, food with it's own zipcode, it's own weather system, and website. Massive, to say the least, and so good. You've gotta fold one of these monsters. Unless you decide to go the fork and knife route, of course. At less than $3 per, two of these guys and a cup of water is a mighty fine and cheap choice for lunch. 

The greek salad and garlic knots were just fine, too. The knots could slay a vampire from behind a steel door. Garlic and garlic aroma: plentiful. 

The service is fine. A little aloof at times and their methodology behind announcing when your order is ready escapes me as being close to efficient. Customers just jammed at the counter and they were trying to figure out whose order was whose. Just a cluster. 

The prices are super affordable and the food is great. I'd come back in a heartbeat if I were craving a good slice of pizza.),(Been awhile since we have been here and overall it was not bad, just overall ok.

You know pizza is good when you don't want toppings, side dishes, condiments, etc. When just a plain slice of hot cheesy goodness is heaven in your mouth, and you start wishing you could eat your weight in it. 
I am not sure if it's true, but when Tony's first opened one of the employee's told me their crust was so crispy and good because they use water from New York. I am not sure if this means they ship it here or have some sort of reverse osmosis time\/space travel machine, but it's great. Tony's crust HAS what many ""New York Style"" pizza restaurants in the south lack...crunch. Your pizza should have so much cheese it runs of the slice, the cheese should be so salty and delicious you could eat it alone, the sauce should marry the flavor of garlic and oregano on your tongue, and if you have to fold the slice to get its entire girth in your mouth then it should snap almost in half!

A few tables and a bar for drinking, but there's no food here. Yes, they sometimes have food trucks come along and that's awesome. But if you're looking for a meal with their great fresh beers (like they do at OMB), then you might be disappointed.

I loved the Cajun spice beer and the Golden Boy Blonde is excellent. Try them all.

Yes, they sell and fill growlers.),(Man. Just when you thought the craft beer scene was peaking in Charlotte, look again. Triple C is holding down another nook in Southend and boy, oh boy, are they doing it well. After much anticipation of opening and itching to pour a few pints for Charlotte's beer lovers, Triple C definitely delivers. 

The interior is all tap room. Tons of beautiful finished wooden tables, bar seating, picnic tables outside, and a few TVs. Nothing too audacious. Love the pallet wood lining the two rear walls. Really makes a fine pattern that draws the eye. Nice touch, dudes!

These guys did it right. Opening with 5 brews gives you the opportunity to sample most of the offering in a flight. In their case, a flight is 4 brews. A rather generous pour in each sample glass and a gorgeous, wooden serving vessel. Check out my photo. 

As for the brews, goodness gracious. The only one we didn't sample was the blonde. I'm typically not fond of blonde beers, so we went for the other four. The smoked amber, light rail pale ale, greenway IPA, and babymaker were all wonderfully different. They've taken the time to fine tune each brew. Have to say that the smoked amber is the most unique. Smokey, almost porter-ish smoke, with the finish of an amber ale. Talk about a wonderful beer to enjoy in the fall. Definitely campfire worthy!

They have growlers available for purchase and refill like most other breweries in town. They are a little on the pricier side. Also, love that you can drink from a pint glass or a schnifter!

They have been making gnarly tacos and are pretty OG as far as food trucks go in the Queen City. Also, I've loved everything I've had from their Uptown location, which is a totally different approach from the truck. Stopped by these guys for dinner recently and happy to report it's still damn good. 

Ok. Pretty much, I'd be happy to gorge on the buffalo cauliflower tacos, pickled veggies, and a few canned beers. Stellar summertime food, man. We went to Food Truck Friday with some friends and the tacos were just as good as I remember. Picked up the special for the night, too. I think they were bbq pork and were killer. 

The sides really round out the tacos. The pickled veggies and bean salad were both awesome. 

What's the secret to those buffalo cauliflower tacos? Wait.....don't tell me. I don't want to know. For now, I'll just tell people that it's magic. Which probably isn't far from the truth. The whole truck is full of some iteration of taco sorcery that I'm forever dig. Keep em comin, boys.

Hat's off to you, TIN Kitchen.),(New food truck in CLT...yeah! 

When I visited Tin Kitchen during the South End Food Truck Rally I was pleasantly surprised by the array of tasty taco options written on their menu board. Despite being super busy, the dudes behind the Tin Kitchen were quite friendly and happy to serve the masses! 

While I was jonesin' for the Thai shrimp tacos, unfortunately, because of their popularity, those little crustacean envelopes were sold out. No worries, though, there were a handful of other delightful looking options to try! 

For $16, hubs and I split the beef brisket tacos & the pork belly tacos (3 each) with kimchi and hoisin sauce. Of the two, I favored the brisket quite a bit more. It was tender, savory and perfectly paired with a crunchy slaw. I was also a fan of the green rice as a side; it was a nicely flavored accompaniment and not the least bit mushy. No one wants mushy rice!

As for the other taco plate, the pork belly was nicely cooked, but the hoisin sauce was almost saccharin sweet and overpowered the pork and the kimchi. 

Overall, Tin Kitchen is off to a great start and I'm looking forward to catching them again soon!),(Blessed to enjoy this food truck two days in a row! I was at NoDa Brewing and experienced the delicious pork nachos. The green tomatillo sauce and goat cheese totally sold this for me! Crunchy chips, creamy goat cheese, spicy tomatillo hot sauce, with shredded pork. Awesome combo! The next afternoon we were shopping for Small Business Saturday and were happy to see the familiar truck parked outside Dudeapalooza in South End. The special was a salmon slider for $4 and wow it was worth every penny! Toasted crispy mini bun with a chunky salmon patty covered in micro greens and a dill sauce, lush!)"

Killer trio right there. 

You know you're doing something right when you talk to people about this place and each one of them has a different must-try fav on the menu.

I've never had a meal that I didn't like. My top three favorites: the Duck Flatbread (root beer bbq should be illegal it's so darn good), Chicken & Waffle Sushi, and the Brew Master BBQ Burger. I'm not one who goes to a restuarant and orders a burger... but when I do it's that one.

On top of the wide selection of handcrafted beers and craft cocktails, Heist also makes homemade sodas and floats. 

Heist also offers a fantastic brunch buffet on Sundays. The spread is insane. There is a different featured protein each week. This can range anywhere from fried catfish to bacon wrapped meatloaf. They also have a waffle station, oyster bar, flat breads, fruit, frittatas... the list goes on and on. Stefan Huebner makes a killer homemade bloody mary mix, but I'm a slave to the $10 bottomless mimosas.

If you want to hit up brunch: go EARLY. Heist fills up quickly. If there's a wait, go ahead and grab a drink at the bar. The wait is well worth it.

Cheers to a a great first year Heist. I'll see you at the anniversary party on the 24th.),(After much anticipation, Heist has finally opened their glorious doors to the culinarily savvy of NoDa and beer-craving crowd of the greater Charlotte population. You wouldn't suspect much out of this old mill turned bar, turned animal hospital, turned brewery, but the decor, service, adventurously ridiculous menu, brews, house-made sodas and potential will make you turn your head more than once. 

First, the decor alone will cause your jaw to drop. The layered wood lining the walls is just outstanding. The pattern it creates draws your eye to being the first thing you see. The main entrance houses a full bar and the booth seating has a gorgeous high back of finished wood. Looks like a dark cherry. Absolutely gorgeous. The chandelier is made of the extra brass pipes from the brewing gear with bullet holes blasted through them! So rad. You can bet that'll show up on pinterest soon....

Service is incredible. There are so many different places to sit -- outside deck, upstairs, main room, tap room -- and the servers ring it up and send it fast. Three different bars to order from, too. 

We ordered the i2PA and the red ale. Both are solid choices. i2PA is by and large my favorite off of the menu thus far. The oatmeal stout is is one of the better choices, too. Next time we're in, we'll have to order a few flights to check out the rest of the lineup. Blueberry Blonde? Sounds crazy interesting!

The menu is just.....insane. Not only from a perspective of fusion, presentation, and taste, but the story behind each menu item. Each item has it's own little quirk and style.

We started with the pretzels and spinach artichoke dip. The presentation of both is stupendous. Pretzels were a little on the firm side, but the beer cheese made up for it. Very nice flavor on the cheese. The spinach artichoke dip was lovely. Served with a flatbread of sorts, and housing huge chunky artichoke hearts. This didn't last long as we scraped every inch of the bowl. Would order both again in a heartbeat. 

 I ordered the Brewmaster burger. A mix of porterhouse and brisket. What? Who in the history of burger-dom has mixed porterhouse and brisket?! It was incredible. Served on brioche, the few standard burger accoutrement, and rosemary tots. These jokers are 2oz tots. Creamy, savory and chewy. The smokiness of the burger was to die for. It wasn't overt, but just subtle enough to inhabit my palate throughout the meal. 

My wife ordered the veggie sandwich. All smokey, grilled veggies on focaccia. A rather hearty sandwich. She ordered the creamed corn with it. Man. Talk about rib-sticking corn! Very creamy and huge corn flavor. 

We ended up ordering dessert as well. We had to sample one of the house made sodas! Went with the orange creamsicle float and the blondie. Both were knockouts. The house-made orange soda was incredible. I can't wait to check out the rest of the lineup. The blondie was just as it should have been. Warm, topped with ice cream, and plenty of rum-infused caramel. What a nice cap to the meal. 

Heist may still be new, but they are showcasing some serious talent all around. These guys hit every sense and beckon for you to dive deeper into the complex menu, both beer and food. These guys will grow and continue to show Charlotte something it has never had before. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Heist!),(For the big 1000th review, I have to review Heist Brewery, a fairly new brewery in a place called NoDa (North Davidson) that I visited last week. My friend's loft is steps away from HB, and it is definitley a good and bad thing. Great since you can go anytime, have a great time, and walk back home, bad, I would definitley spend way too much money and pack on a ton of calories at this place!

Thursday evening, we had a table right next to the bar, so very convenient. It was a special night, as they were unveiling the beer tap handles. Professional photos were being taken, some delicious hor dourves available, and felt like I was in a monumental moment as people were purchasing glasses of beer as people cheered on. 

This place is a lot larger than I had expected, as there's a huge area beyond the front bar. There, you can see the brewery through glass, and it's a large open space of tables and bar tables.

I was introduced to the Moscow Mule, a Russian version of a margarita. It's also poured in these copper (or silver) mugs that keep the drink extra cold the entire time. It was AMAZING! Very addicting, as it's not super strong. The ginger beer was refreshing, especially with the lime provided. I could've drank these all night, and only $9!

We shared a bunch of appetizers, which they have a lot of unique combinations plus your typical bar fare with a twist (strawberry bun anyone?). My favorite by far, was my local friends' favorites as well, the 6 cheese pimento and sherried crab dip. Delicious, especially with the parmesean flatbread provided! I could not stop eating it! Their spinach and artichoke dip was just as good as well! I ordered the jerked chicken flatbread pizza, which was good, but I'd have to say the root beer BBQ duck pizza was even better! We also got the forked-up ahi, which also came with a wasabi soy mist in a mini bottle! How clever is that? 

Great ambience of locals dining and drinking, and definitley had a great night here that ended my trip quite nicely. Would definitley recommend this place and feel like one of the locals in the trendy NoDa area!)"

In an ornately dressed and dimly lit space, Blue Taj offers up a lunch special that is not to be missed! $9 for your choice of salad or soup, entree, rice and naan! And the best part is that it's super delicious and comes out fairly quickly - perfect for a work lunch! Here's how it went down...

1) Salad: 3\/5: A small serving of bright greens with a strange but flavorful strawberry dressing. The dressing was a bit a la strawberry smoothie, but good nonetheless.

2) Chicken Tikka Masala: 5\/5: Spicy, rich and creamy. Perfect with the complimentary rice. The big chunks of chicken are delightful and the sauce is filled with tons of flavor. Spice level three was a nice amount of heat, but nothing to set a fire to my mouth. 

3) Naan: 4\/5: Yeeeeah free naan. Four triangles between my dining partner and I. And it went very well with the tikka masala. 

One other note...if you're headed to the restroom, be careful going around that corner! I almost smacked right into a server carrying a very full tray of eats. Moral of the story - hit up Blue Taj for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch.),(Blue Taj is located in the Ballantyne Village, where everything is shiny and new.  Sister restaurant to Copper,  beautiful space, great service and an expensive menu.  The restaurant is divided into sections, one is dark with pink and orange sheer curtains, a small dining room off to the side has stark white tables with blue chairs and tiny blue glass bread plates, the dining room in the back is dark wood with green chairs and green glass plates.  I thought about changing some plates around, but decided not to aggravate the nice waiters.

Service is stellar and very pleasant.  I think the great service is going to carry them.  The food is very good, I am so bad, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, just like I order at Copper!  It is so yummy.  If you like heat, make sure you remember to tell them spicy.  I think it is pretty tame unless you specify!)"

There is better nearby if you want Mexican (the 1900 around the corner on Park, for instance) or other sit down food (at the Roasting Company).

I've seen people order $12 worth of higher-end items at a TB, which never makes sense to me. I can completely enjoy (within limits, this isn't Ruth's Chris!) a 7 Layer Burrito or a Spicy Chicken Burrito and walk out of here with change from $5. Add the ""fire"" sauce for a little extra zing.

As TB's go, this one is within standards. Sometimes they fold the burrito properly (sealed at both ends) and sometimes they don't and you have to make sure it doesn't all leak out the bottom.

Service is very good and the servers are attentive.  I ordered a Reuben while my wife ordered Phlly Spring Rolls and Potato Cakes.  The Reuben was fair and would have been better if the sauerkraut had been drained so that the whole sandwich is not soggy.  Wife enjoyed her Spring Rolls but the pleasant surprise was the Potato Cakes.  Excellent and far superior to anything I was expecting or could have hoped for

All in all, the food was fair but not to the point that I would make a point of making this a destination.

We've stumbled in on multiple occasions to this location. Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Optimal time for us is a weekend afternoon. Not buzzing with margarita vultures and other seekers of neon drinks with umbrellas in them. We're just here for the food, typically. However, I've seen quite a few neon blue margaritas floating around. They must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea....er...booze. 

My wife and I love the mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla. Perfectly simple and just enough pungent flavor to keep everything interesting. The goat cheese works perfectly with crispy, buttery outer shell of the tortilla. It's somewhat phyllo-esque upon each bite. So flaky and fragile. The mushrooms could be sauteed a bit better, but the flavors are all there. Huge win. 

The tableside guac is an absolute win. Perfect amount for a table of four or two starvacious diners. Balanced well with tomatoes, onion and citrus. I'm not a huge fan of guac that has too many additives. Cantina does it up right. Smooth avocado and the rest of the veggies take care of the chunky aspects. My only gripe is the chips they give you to dip with. Not flat. All folded and intermingling with one another. I want my chips to be separate. Playing by their own rules. Not hugging one another. The flavor is all there. Just too much fraternization. 

Love Cantina. Now, to expand my horizons and check out some of this ever-present booze they have going on. Cheers!)"

The grapeberry was perky, bitter, sweet and had a subtle strawberry flavor. It really grows on you sip after sip. The color is brilliant pink, too. Very odd color for juice, but interesting.

We ordered the Roast Pork Banh Mi and the Cured Ham Banh Mi, both are $5.50 each. Admittedly this is the most expensive banh mi I've ever purchased, but there was a lot of meat in the roast pork. Maybe the ingredients are harder to find in this part of the country and that's why they are more expensive than usual. Despite the price, the bread is 100% authentic and fresh and both meats were delicious, though we preferred the roast pork's flavor. I think they tone down the spice here, which I missed the chili sauce that I'm used to getting. I'm sure that's something I could order if\/when I pass by here again.

My shopping experience was pleasant. I found almost everything that I was looking for, only needing to hit up Publix for a few bits. The deli here needs help and the produce isn't as bright as the others, but the grocery section is great. Beer and wine is pretty good for a supermarket as well.

On the outside, the cart corrals were clear but I did spot some significant litter in the parking lot. And while Meg (who is super!) was ringing up and bagging my groceries, I saw two Food Lioners just leaning on carts and chatting rather than helping.),(This is actually one of the better Food Lion stores I've visited in Charlotte. You can tell they're trying to compete in the grocery wars game. 

I'll admit it, Harris Teeter and Trader Joe's are my go-to's. But let's be honest, that Plaza Midwood HT gets bat ish crazy sometimes. If I can't find a spot in their parking lot, I head to this Food Lion. Don't even attempt that HT when Charlotte loses its mind over snowmageddon, come straight here. I don't love the meat and seafood options, but overall this place gets the job done for a basic grocery store run.

It's a great place for a quick lunch during the weekdays but I would never come here with a sushi craving.  I got take-out one night for dinner (was pretty desperate for food and hungry).  The sushi here is mediocre.  The quality of the fish isn't anything you're going to be impressed with (can't expect it, with the low prices).

This is a good bring-back-to-your-desk lunch for the workaholics out there.

I will agree with the other Yelp reviewers that it's a great place for the money though.),(Hubs and I stumbled onto this little gem very soon after we moved to Charlotte a few years ago. Since we lived in the Fourth Ward at the time, we were thrilled to try sushi delivery just a few streets down. 

We've since ordered KO (delivered to our house - just a mile south of Uptown in South End) and every time we get it, the sushi is basic, but fresh and delish! The delivery guy is always nice and he definitely works hard in the rain on his moped to ensure that we get our food in an adequate amount of time. I don't think we've ever waited more than 45 minutes for our food and the one time it was sub-par (wrong items and jumbled from the ride over), they very kindly comped our next order. 

I would recommend the shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy veggie roll and the Godzilla roll (my personal fave). Per some other reviews, definitely pay attention to the specials - they make this little spot even more affordable than it already is! Just make sure you hit the minimums required for lunch or dinner orders...we never have that problem as we typically eat our weight in sushi. 

Yay for KO.),(GR! yelp address was wrong, this place is ACTUALLY on 3rd street and Tryon (more on 3rd street).

They have some secret February specials that I wish I knew before!
Monday: 10% off special rolls
Tuesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more
Wednesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more (delivery not included)
Thursday: 20% off all nigiri and sashimi
Friday: 20% off special rolls (5pm-9:30pm)
Saturday: 20% off all orders
Sunday: 20% off with valid student id
**All specials exclude combo and fax orders.

I thought it would be a nice little walk to KO, but the area is pretty ghetto and deserted at night. I got asked for spare change EEK! I would recommend just getting take out, besides they don't have indoor seating anyway and delivery is just $1.

Love how generous they are with the seaweed salad. Wish the sashimi was a little cheaper, but still a good dinner option. For some reason I can't get my order under $20 ever. It's still a solid and affordable sushi option.),(So I had to try the u-do noodles folks reviewed about here...

The waffle cones are made fresh in house and are definitely better than the pre-packaged cake cones. We had fresh peach ice cream and a cone of the turtle ice cheesecake ice cream. Both were a delectable treat for a hot afternoon!

The only problem is, sometimes the line gets pretty damn long and you have to wait a while to be seated, but they do the best to accomodate you.  

Originally from Atlanta, where Asian foods, (and Thai) are readily available, I found this place to my preference when it came to Asian foods in Charlotte.  I almost always got the (sometimes extra spicy) spicy basil beef, and it was just the right amount of spicy that kind of burns your tongue a little but doesn't cause you to run in search of milk.  Not sure what the dinner menu is like, but I assume it's more expensive.  I wouldn't pay more than the lunch price for a meal here.),(Will I pay $15 for Pad Thai? Why, yes, yes I will, because it's that good at Basil. When I moved to the Queen City a few years ago, I had a hard time finding really delicious Thai food. I tried a few local favorites but I was never impressed. In comes Basil... 

The atmosphere is chic and modern and the restaurant is well appointed. I'm happy that they added valet service and a bit of outdoor seating - always helpful for local peeps to drop by. As I mentioned before, I positively crave their Pad Thai and always ask them to make mine spicy, but not Thai hot - I'd like to keep my taste buds intact. As for their other dishes, I've thoroughly enjoyed their Pad See Eu, Pad Woon Sen, Basil Chicken and beef satay. The portions are fairly large - but not massive Maggiano's style. 

The service has always been top notch here - the one time that we waited at our table 10+ minutes before a waiter got around to us they kindly sent a free dessert our way. Said dessert was fried ice cream - not my personal favorite, but I appreciated the sentiment. Definitely give Basil a try if you're looking for delicious, upscale Thai fare in the QC. Oh - and for those of you who travel to the coast - Basil has another location in Charleston and is opening a new location in Mt. Pleasant (also SC) in the fall of 2010!),(I have been to Basil twice now in two weeks, both times it has been
delicious.  My first interaction with the hostess was not very pleasurable,
I went into the restaurant at 1120a and they didn't open till 1130a. Gasp.
I wanted to sit down, grab a glass of wine and read Creative Loafing and wait for my girlfriend.  Let me just say I was denied access. 

 I know I have a lot of nerve showing up so early and before anyone explains to me the inner workings of a restaurant, I supported myself, full time, non-stop as a waitress for twenty years.  Let's just say good thing the food was delicious or I would have not been back.  Finally when the hostess saw fit to sit the now three tables at the door, she walked me to my table. 

 I sat down and ordered a glass of Prosecco, it came a little flat, I thought,  BOOOOO, but I couldn't complain, it would just be in bad form.  I drank my flat sparkling, I have had worse.  We started with basil rolls and chicken Larb.  The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.  I have only had Chicken Larb served chilled like a salad, this Larb,  the chicken was freshly cooked and served room temperature. Larb is usually a meat concoction of mint leaves, chili, onion, rice powder
in lime juice and fish sauce.  We also shared some chicken red curry, it was great, how can you go wrong with coconut milk and red curry?   

My second visit I went at a more suitable hour of 1p, so I didn't get any
lip from the hostess.  We had basil rolls again, shrimp fried in egg roll
wrappers and Pad Thai, everything is fresh and the heat index is perfect, you can ask for chili sauce and make dishes as spicy as you like.  I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.

So far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.  I feel like everyone is allowed to have a bad day, maybe I could make sure I am really nice next time I go in there, maybe she won't remember me as that customer that came in too early.  I would rather be known as that lady who drinks at 1132a.

Basil Thai gets a 3 corndog rating.),(Just drinks and hot soup this time, which still brings in around $20....so a special place...not a regular place for me.),(Basil Thai Cuisine was recommended by a fellow coworker to eat for dinner.  Pretty tasty... and pricey too.  Their website boasts as ""Refined Thai""; which I would agree with.  If you ask me, I probably wouldn't pay that much for Asian food unless I'm on a hot date where the guy pays for it though.  Since I was traveling for business, why not?

I ordered the Pad See-Eu.  Delicious but it'll cost you $16.95.),(In the south, Thai food is few and far between. This is THE place to get Thai in Charlotte. It's not a hole in the wall nor is it staffed by people who are actually from Thailand... Basil Thai is on the contemporary-chic side of the dining spectrum. 

There is almost always a crowd in the entryway and the spacious dining area is well decorated and inviting. I have been for lunch several times, dinner and gotten take-out- and it's pretty solid. It's not the most authentic Thai but the presentation is pretty and it's always fresh. Service is also good- very enthusiastic and friendly staff. 

Glad there's a thai place near my apartment- just a quick walk for green curry or spring rolls is good in my book.)"

The food was brought out to my table quickly, where I was enjoyed one of their draft beer selections (Yuengling for $2.50!) The small fries were hot and there would be enough to share. (I missed that they also have sweet potato fries. Dang!)

I opted not to go for the milkshake, but other people in the place were enjoying theirs. If there wasn't a Cold Stone Creamery right next door, I'd say that coming in just for the shake looks like fun.

A few things to be aware of...

1) They charge by the ounce, so if you're being all gluttonous, you're going to pay for it, literally. 
2) The toppings are fab. Everything from Butterfinger bits to Captain Crunch to a smattering of fresh fruit. 
3) The employees here are super nice and will always ask if you'd like to sample anything. Sweet! 

My personal favorite combo is a small swirl of dark chocolate, cheesecake and peanut butter topped with chocolate chips and a dusting of Butterfinger bits. Or, perhaps I'll go all healthy with coconut fro yo, coconut shavings and fresh pineapple. I don't know...it's a game time decision!),(I live close to pinkberry and whole foods, so If I have a froyo or gelato craving I'm in good hands. But yoforia is a nice change of pace. 

It's self-serve and has a good selection of toppings. And while some dislike their flavor selections because they are, at times, on the wild side, I happen to love taro and green tea and pistachio flavor. I think that in order to carve its own niche with competitors in the neighborhood they have to stand out. And based upon the lines I see in the mall to get yoforia, I'm not the only one who likes what they see.

They shut down for a while due to the flooding, but they seem to have bounces back without skipping a beat this summer. I think I'll go back there again later today!),(Good frozen yogurt.  The only complaint I have is they did not have the typical good flavors, like red velvet.  That said, the place was clean, cheap and the yogurt they did have was good all the same.  Some of the more popular flavors would be nice though.)"

Earl's Grocery is several things. Bakery, coffee bar, place to grab breakfast-lunch-dinner, prepared foods, wine and cheese shop, and specialty beverages you can't find in other places. 

My current obsession here is the pork ramen. It's delicious. I also like the dog of the day and the kimchi collard greens. To be honest, I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've had here except the Banh Mi. I have to agree with others on this one. I found it to be greasy and hard to eat. I actually ended up throwing most of mine away, which is not something I ever do. So far, that's the only miss on the menu for me. 

How it works: grab a drink from the coolers and then go up to the kitchen counter to place you order. That way you can pay for everything together and then go sit down to wait for your food. Make sure you pay attention to prices on the drinks. There are some that are a little much. Nothing worse than buying a $6 coconut water by mistake. My last visit here the girl at the counter pointed out how much a drink was. Life saver. My friend immediately swapped it out for something else. Everyone who works here is so nice. 

On top of the tables and chairs, they also have a bar like counter. It is perfect if you're looking to get out of your house and get some work done. Earl's opens up the big windows on nice days.

Important note: Earl's Grocery is open until 8:30pm on week night, but the grill\/kitchen does close at 8pm. 

Parking: street (free after 6pm) or in the lot across the way. The trolley thing will be coming through here at some point when they get it done.

First it was Smalls (now closed), then Viva Chicken, and now Earl's? Goodness me, how are you going to top this? If you take a stroll out of the Visulite or dinner from Customshop without waltzing in for a few high-class chocolates, a few bottles of wine, Charlotte coffee, or pasta from the coolest self-serve station I've ever seen, then you're not truly living. 

Thank you to the folks who have decided to marry the conceptualizations from Dean & Deluca and Common Market. It's edgy enough to where the cool kids will find their way in for a Japanese pour over and classy (albeit clean) enough where all of the Myers Park ladies-who-lunch will stop by for a sandwich during the day. They've really hit the nail square on the head with this spot. 

I'm looking forward to patronizing the coffee bar a bit more in the near future. Pretty cool to see they are supporting Charlotte roasteries with coffees from the bar and also whole bean.

For my entree, I ordered the seafood pasta from the specials board. It was delicious and had a good amount of quality seafood in it. We also ordered cannolis, tiramisu, and lemoncello cake.

Just as good? The lemon cheese pastry with a side of sweetened cream cheese. Delicious!

I sat here at Rush for about an hour and used a good amount of their wifi while drinking my coffee and eating that pastry. Mostly decent music played and there were several interesting conversations going on that kept me entertained.

Cold morning, so the outside seats weren't occupied and there were still a couple of two-tops available inside. I liked this place!),(There is a glint of hope for south Charlotte! A non-chain coffee shop! We're saved! 

This place has great ownership. I've met them before, but can't remember their names. Pretty sure one guy is from Australia and boy is he friendly!

This place serves some high-end product. They recently switched from only selling blends from illy coffee (one of my favorites of the commercial world) to a more recent brand called LavAzza. Pretty good stuff. 

On occasion, I've even seen a bit of latte art come out of Rush! Not sure who the baristas are, but some of them can actually make you something special. Nice to see in yuppyville. 

It's so nice to see some baristas who can actually tamp, pull and pour a decent espresso in south Charlotte. These places are few and far between from Ballantyne to Uptown. Definitely worth asking for something daring, folks. Step away from your cozy and boring triple shot, venti frappucino. Or whatever. This place knows how to make you a cafe latte. 

Definitely worth venturing and trying some of their teas as well. They carry a great brand of bright and flavorful teas to choose from. 

The vibe inside is a little pretentious but that's a bit expected. It's a little too clean and overrun with non-hipsters. Can't be too choosy, though. It is Ballantyne after all. 

If you're in the Ballantyne area, support this local business rather than one of the larger chains. Definitely worth the coin and much more love goes into their beverages. 

Get to know the owners as well! They have great stories. 

Thanks for existing, Rush. Glad to have a place like this in our neck of the woods.),(I go here often because my friends like it. Good prices and great food selection.The Strawberry smoothie was too much milk, not enough berry. I've purchased 2 other coffee drinks but I can't remember what they were...

I am a huge cider fan, so I was pumped when Charlotte finally got a cidery. I get it, when some people think of cider they picture super sweet like an Angry Orchard or Woodchuck. Red Clay proves there is so much more to cider profiles and flavors. There's always a wide variety (dry, semi dry, tart, even dry hopped) and they love to get creative. My last visit here they had Holla Piña (made with pineapples and jalapeno). So good. I also love their fall seasonal pumpkin.

Each of the competition dishes were expected to have used the honey in some way or another. Most seemed to just go with a drizzle on top and there's nothing wrong with that, but after having a taste, it seemed like a limited way to demo this tasty goodness.

Fortunately, Cloister also had a booth at the Food Fight and that gave me an opportunity to not only try their straight honey but the interesting whipped honeys on offer. I wasn't daring enough to try the Ghost Pepper, but the Lemon was tasty!

I brought my wife a pound of honey. She loved it. Go, me! Go, Cloister!),(Oh honey do I love this honey. I first stumbled upon Cloister Honey at the Atherton Mill Farmer's Market, where the nice man behind the counter let me sample all 10 of their delightful honeys. Raw honey in a myriad of different flavors, pepper infused honey, whipped honey in chocolate, lemon, cinnamon oh my! My personal favorites are the Sourwood raw honey and the cinnamon whipped honey. I could pretty much slather this stuff on anything and wolf it down. 

Price wise, expect to pay just a bit more than your typical grocery store honey, but it is well, well worth it. The folks take care of their bees in a non-mass production way and it shows. The staff are all sweet, knowledgeable and passionate about their product. Plus, it's all based in NC - including the bees!

Barbecue capitals of America. You should include Charlotte, as we know 'cue here in this town and don't y'all forget it. So when you're changing planes here our very fine Queen City airport, stop in the main atrium (between the B and C concourses) and get yourself a plate of barbecue.

Yep, there's a line. Yep, it's totally worth it.

I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with one side. Mac & cheese is it. And of course, a fried pickle spear. You Yankees who ain't never had a fried pickle? Try it, you might like it.

They'll offer to put barbecue sauce on the meat. Your answer here is ""Yes, please.""

At the register, grab one of those locally brewed beers that you probably won't find elsewhere. OMB (""Olde Mecklenburg Brewery"") or NoDa or a Carolina Blonde from Carolina Brewery up in Mooresville. Maybe a little cup of banana pudding too.

And find a place to sit. In this instance, I don't recommend the rocking chairs as it's potentially messy food and you don't want to wear it.

Pick up your sandwich and dig in. If it's like mine, it's tender and juicy and tangy and delicious. Mmmmm... that's barbecue. Welcome to Charlotte. Enjoy your stay!),(Why 4 stars? Because this is very solid for airport BBQ.

   ---   ---   ---

When you're at an airport, standards are definitely lowered. I fly through Charlotte fairly often, and must definitely attest that the fare at the people-mover-capital-of-the-world is uninspiring. However, Brookwood is a drink of water in the middle of the desert.

It's a fast casual spot, in the midst of a giant food court that's centered amongst all of the terminals, so convenience is a 5 out of 5. 

I went with pulled pork, brisket, hush puppies, a fried pickle, and mac-n-cheese. It also comes with corn bread. Clearly, I was counting calories during my visit.

All items were at least average or better. I don't like fried things, but ordered the hush puppies due to the feedback on Yelp. They were definitely better than I anticipated, especially considering that whole 'they live in an airport' thing I just mentioned. But I still probably would order for something not fried on my next visit. The pickle was definitely worth ordering again. 

Charlotte is probably the city I've laid over in the most without ever actually visiting. Until then, this is the closest thing to authentic Carolina BBQ I've had. I have failed.),(OH my LORD... Have merci on my soul. 
The veggie place is to DIE for! The black eye peas are,cooked perfectly with the rut amount of sweetness. The mac & cheese is just mouth-watering delicious, perfect amount of salt and softness. The hush puppies? Don't even get me started on the hush puppies! Everything here at the Brookwood Farms BBQ is made with a precise balance, EVERYTHING. I even ate a fried pickle for the first time in my life and maaan I'm LOVIN' it.  Seriously our next trip is out to the south were the food is good and the music is loud! ;) I highly doubt ill be able to eat Southern\/Soul food in Cali now... I've been marked by the natives! ;)),(I used to fly through CLT all the time and was pleasantly reminded why I didn't mind spending a couple hours here on my travel days. The reason is this BBQ spot. Its quick because its done fast food style in the food court but the food is delicious. Probably the only place in here with a line because people literally search it out.

I get the same thing every time - pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and a fried pickle on the side (comes with it). The pork has tons of flavor before you even put sauce on it and their sauce adds that much more. It's not my favorite style of BBQ sauce but no complaints by any means.

I think the fried pickle is my favorite part. Every time I get fried pickles they are done as chips but this place throws in a battered pickle spear with your meal. I need to look for more places that do them like this.

If you're in an airport with terrible options this place is a savior.),(Decent option of the airport, I guess.

They have all kinds of bbq and sides here, so the selection is not a problem. I just though there was too much vinegar in the bbq. I know that this style of bbq is vinegar based, but I think my serving or the bbq from that day was ""over vinegard"". I know that is not a word. This is Yelp, not a vocabulary test.  

The meat I got was pulled pork and brisket. The mac and cheese side was decent and the fried pickle was my favorite.),(Our morning layover in The Queen City led us straight to Brookwood Farms BBQ, which was serving up breakfast at the time of our visit. Two breakfast sammies and a couple OJs came to around ten bucks, which was pretty reasonable for the airport. The food court-style seating area nearby was clean, the sandwiches were tasty (bacon, egg, cheese and a hashbrown on a biscuit), and with that we were on our way.),(I was excited to try this place out. Yuck! The mashed potato tasted like cardboard. Sour cardboard. That's the best way to describe it. Stale, old, dry, and sour. Never had a potato experience like this. How do you make potato sour? Really gross.),(I have never had fried pickles before but now i am a fan.......A must try. Some of the best beef brisket i have ever tasted. The corn and mac and cheese didn't hurt my feelings ether. this is a must try),(It's a good option when you're not in the mood to eat at one of the national fast food chains offered at the airport. The bbq won't blow your mind away but it will do its job decently. The employees seemed irritable and weren't helpful. I recommend getting the junior plate if you have a small appetite. It comes with 1 meat, 1 side, and corn bread. I got the beef brisket, which was thick cut. I got a piece w some fat in it, so I was pretty happy. There are a variety of standard bbq sides to pick from. I chose the collards. They were good.),(This place has good food, good service and they are really fast. You need fast at an airport. This restaurant is located the the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte North Carolina. 

By the way this is really a super nice airport. See my review on this airport. So we were on our way home from Las Vegas and anytime you are on your way home from Vegas, your pretty bummed out. So being sad that I have to go home and go back to work, I needed a nice meal to cheer me up and let me tell you I found a super nice meal the Brookwood Farms Carolina Pit BBQ joint. Yes my Yelp friends this restaurant cheered me up. 

The Carolina's are famous for their BBQ and this place won't let you down. The food is already prepared so all you do is order and they fix your plate and your done. This is important when you have a connecting flight. We only had about 45 minutes between flight and we needed good fast and this place is set up for just that. 

The employees are really nice and seem like they enjoy their jobs. I got a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries. It was Carolina BBQ at its best. The pork was moist and tasty, the Cole slaw amazing and the fries crisp and tasty. Just what you need when traveling. I feel like I want to drive the 6 hour drive from my house in Virginia to North Carolina just to have lunch or something here, it's worth the drive. 

If you are ever flying through this airport, then stop and get yourself a great BBQ sandwich. You'll be happy you did, enjoy.),(Stopping through the Charlotte airport during prime lunchtime, I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for and there were actually plenty of options. I was a little skeptical of airport BBQ but after reading a few of the reviews, I decided WHY NOT?!

I went with a brisket platter which came with two sides. I opted for baked beans and fried okra. It also came with a fried pickle and cornbread. Trying to cut calories here, ya know. (Yeah right.)  

The brisket was surprisingly tender, to the point where I could cut through it with my plastic fork. I really like the BBQ sauce on top, as well. The fried okra was a little soggy, baked beans pretty standard, and the cornbread good. May not sound like the most rave review, but I almost devoured the entire plate and was overall quite satisfied with my Carolina BBQ experience thanks to that meat.

It wasn't the cheapest. For the platter and an unsweet tea, I paid around $16; however, if it's BBQ you crave, I would suggest giving this spot a try.),(With a few notable exceptions (PDX being one), airport food sucks. It's a collection of bad fast food and off-brand, trying-to-act-bougey-and-gourmet joints managed by HMSHost or some similarly uncaring, vanilla, corporate overlords. However every once in a while you find something decent, even at an airport otherwise dominated by chains. Since I travel a lot, I have gotten pretty good at seeking out the diamonds in the rough, and this is one of them. 

Now, would this stand up against the best BBQ in the downtown area of your average city? Probably not. But when it comes to airport food, this is millennia ahead of everything else. It's assembly line, which makes it quick. The brisket is pretty tasty. The baked beans are good. The greens? Passable. Is it expensive? Sure. But hey... so is EVERYTHING here. It's an airport. 

This is an easy choice for anyone not wanting gross, industrial foods from notoriously gross fast food chains. It's actually decent. And it served me quite well. Do yourself a favor and skip the BK, Quiznos, and other garbage and go here instead.),(What do you do when you have a three hour layover in CLT with no reason to leave the airport? Well, why don't you try snacking on some Carolina BBQ for starters?

I've heard of Brookwood prior to coming to CLT for my short layover. Somehow I expected this typical food court style restaurant to taste and feel like a university dining hall. While they were able to definitely quell my BBQ cravings, I left feeling like I wanted more.

More sauce? More meat? Perhaps a bit of both.

I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich which comes with a decent amount of meat tucked in between two buns, which weren't toasted. You have a choice of two sides so I opted for the cole slaw and mac n' cheese. They also throw in a fried pickle which was an added bonus.

For $10, I would rate this airport BBQ better than expected, but still lacking some of that genuine BBQ punch I was hoping for. The bread used for my buns was very stale so I ignored that entirely. Pulled pork on the other hand was right up there, although I would have liked a bit more smokey flavor. Can't win em all at an airport right?

If you're looking for options, Brookwood should definitely be on your list of places to try here at CLT.),(I always hope the food will be awesome and every time I'm disappointed. But average BBQ is better than most airport food options...)"

Our server at our go-to Sunday football spot was out of town this weekend. So, we decided to switch things up and try AAP. Some of the group adamantly did not want a venue change. They were outvoted.

The place was PACKED. Inside and out. I didn't realize Bengals fans congregate here. It was rocking after their big win against the Patriots. 

We had about ten people in our group (a group made up of current and former service industry peeps). Every single one of us was just completely blown away by the service. It seemed as though AAP had 400 people working. An empty glass wouldn't last on a table more than five minutes before someone was by to snag it. At one point, I was dropping things on the floor just to see how quickly they would be picked up. (Okay, I made the last line up, but you get my point) Our server Stacy was completely on point. Never skipped a beat the entire seven hours we were there. No one was ever drink-less. Food came out quickly.

Bravo AAP. You guys are a well-oiled machine on game day. Now if only I could say the same thing about the Panthers....),(Been here a couple of times. Actually had lunch here today with some friends. 

I like the interior. Definitely has an all american bar vibe to it. Big booths, very spacious, lots of tvs. We actually sat at the bar today.

Service is pretty good. The bartender was very friendly and the servers are usually very friendly and attentive. 

Now onto the food. I ordered the philly cheesesteak, one of my friends the BLT with egg and the other friend the fish sandwich. We also shared the chicken nachos. Overall the food wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. The portions were pretty huge, I have to say. My last few visits I've ordered and liked the wings. I think I'll revert back to that habit. 

The had a nice list for drinks and had daily drink specials which is always a plus. Prices were pretty reasonable too. Some of the entrees were only a couple bucks more than the sandwiches. I hear that on weekends they move the tables aside and turn it into a dancefloor. lol

Overall I won't gush over the food. It's not bad, yet not outstanding. but if you're looking for a fun place in southend to catch a game, this place is cool for that. Decent bar food choices, even better drink specials, reasonable prices, and pretty good service too.)"

Typical of this food style (like Moe's and Qdoba), it's an assembly line of meat, veggies and then salsa in a burrito or a salad. It's nice to be able to see your food prepared right in front of you so you can see exactly what's going on and ask for more (or less) of any particular item.

I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken burrito, which has an excellent spicy taste, especially when you go with the medium or spicy salsa and add some of the made-in-the-store guacamole. Rolled up, it's always just barely big enough to fit inside the soft tortilla shell. My wife prefers the fresh grilled chicken quesadilla with the corn salsa and a zesty cheese.

The soda fountain has Coke products (including Coke Zero) but I usually end up with the 5 calorie Lemonade which I refill to go.

Unfortunately, they are not open on Sundays (possibly because they're surrounded by mostly office parks?).

Very friendly staff and the place is always clean and tidy. A couple of TV's are usually tuned into CNN or Fox News.

It's like the Subway\/Chipotle model of made-to-order pizza. It's quick, it's custom and it's tasty.

They have a handful of ""set"" combinations, but those are nothing more than hints. Meat lovers, veggie lovers, that sort of thing. But they're all completely open to customizing as you and your pizza make your way down the toppings line. And yes, everything's a set price.

I opted to start with their ""White Pizza"" adding chicken and extra garlic. Once topped, it went into the oven and then maybe five minutes later, it was out of the oven. A thin and crispy crust with all the toppings nicely melted. Very delicious, if I may say so myself.

Inside and outside seating.),(Blood orange lemonade. Get it. You need it in your life. 

I am in love with these fast casual pizza concepts in town. You can add as many toppings as you want and it's still the same price, here it's around eight bucks. They make the dough in house every day and also have a gluten free crust. I always get the spicy sauce, a mix of cheeses, turkey meatballs, and then decide the other toppings based on my mood that day. I recommend not going way overboard and adding too many. There's 40 to choose from, so choose wisely. I also recommend eating your pizza there right after it comes out of the oven. It only takes a few minutes to bake. For me, I usually can make two meals out of a pizza. Or, I could just as easily crush the entire thing in one sitting. 

Parking: several of the reviews here say there's no parking. If you can't find a street spot or don't want to pay a meter, Blaze does offer free parking at the Camden Gallery garage for up to two hours.

Misc: the workers always have smiles on their faces. I've met the owner here, both him and his wife are both super nice. The outside tables are great for people watching. Get a s'more pie for dessert and make sure to get it toasted in the oven. 

Seriously though, blood orange lemonade. You're welcome.),(It's basically Subway for pizza, and you should expect the same quality. 

Most of the employees were friendly, but when trying to make one guy laugh, he just looked at me with a scowl. The pizza is average at best. It's the fresh toppings that hide the lack of taste. I also ordered a Caesar salad but took it off the order once I saw it was boxed. The s'more was decent but nothing memorable. 

If you're into the hip vibe above taste, then go for it. If you're into quality pizza above style, then you might want to skip it.)"

Our server and food runners were very helpful an attentive, and gave excellent entree recommendations. The dining crowd that night consisted of mostly families and it was a lively bunch. 

The meal came with salad and bread. Both of which were fine. My entree (chicken Portofino) first of all was pretty huge and excellent!  I usually finish my entrees in restaurants, but I had to take it home. It was delicious that night and pretty darn delicious for lunch the next day too. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well. 

We also found the meal to be very reasonable. Not pricey at all. So oversll, the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. I cannot wait to take my parents there when they visit. In fact, I can't wait that long, I'll be back there very soon! :)),(best italian food i've had in Charlotte, the pizzas are great, the puttanesca is some of the best i've had, the chicken gorgonzola is no joke, and the tiramisu even my old italian dad loved when he visited.)"

Their lunch prices are quite inexpensive for the amount of food you get .  You have your choice of 6 different sushi lunch specials which all come with 2 different rolls and a salad or miso soup from $7 to $12.  These are no scrawny pieces of sushi either.

They also have a nice selection of chinese dishes that are tasty...if you like lettuce wraps give them a try here.. of course they are not PF Changs but they deserve a mention.

Been awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.

My wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.

Only negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.

My Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.

Service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.

The sandwiches are really small and bland (got the hot mushroom sammy, which turned out more like luke warm with a few mushrooms on stale bread). All the sandwiches are premade, so they don't taste very fresh and you can't customize the ingredients. Sandwiches come with your choice of dipping sauce which makes it slightly more tasty. For $6.95 you can get a half sandwich\/salad or soup combo which isn't too bad. But the side salad options are no good, stick with the full sandwich if you have a choice. I had the couscous and it was so sour I just threw it out. 

Also, the entree salads are pretty small and they lack topping variety. I wish I went to chick-fil-a. Adding an extra star for friendly service, but I'm definitely not coming back here.)"

Service was good. Be warned that they put a lot of ice in the sodas, but they do give free refills.),(Sometimes you walk out of an intense yoga class feeling all great and think wow, I want to go eat something bad now. That was my Tuesday. And this was my naughty transgression. 

I love this place. It doesn't matter how awful of a day you may be having... you walk into Mr. K's and immediately feel happy. This place has been family owned and operated for more than 45 years. All of the warm fuzzies. 

My go to order: chili dogs. Make sure to have them throw the dog on the grill. Love the chili and it's always the right amount.

They've been serving ice cream for almost 50 years! 

Stumble in for a burger or a milkshake in the dog days and you can't go wrong. You'll be hard pressed not to think back to the good ol' days when you were a kid. Walking into Mr. K's is like walking into a museum. Lower ceilings, tiny booths (good enough for one person on each side, haha) and an old school shotgun style exposed grill top. Familiar smells and hard to choose on lunch or dessert! 

Mr. K's makes a mean milkshake, though. I've been in here a handful of times and always have left with a milkshake. Chocolate and strawberry are always choice. Thick and good to eat with a spoon or wait for that perfect melty consistency and stick a straw in it.

Even though Mr. K's serves up some tasty burgers and fries, I'd much prefer to spend my time (and calorie allotment) on the sweet treats.

Mr. K's is such a Charlotte staple - an old school joint with greasy eats and amazing ice cream creations. Don't expect to grab ridiculously upscale and creative ice cream creations here. Instead, on the sugar front, Mr. K's serves up incredible milkshakes, soft serve and sundaes - the brownie sundae is my personal fave. It's a large portion of creamy vanilla soft serve with a sizeable brownie topped with a massive amount of chocolate and caramel sauce and whipped cream. 

The employees here (especially the owner) are extremely kind and always seem very welcoming to each customer who stops by. Be sure you bring cash, as Mr. K's is cash only. I'm a big, big fan of Mr. K's and I'm always looking forward to my next cool treat from this famous ice cream joint just down the street.),(When I was a kid, it was always a bonus when we got ice cream and it turned out to be soft serve.  It was my favorite!  I still love soft serve ice cream.  I have driven by Mr. K's and never had any inclination to stop.  I thought this is a Charlotte institution, I need to go get an ice cream.

After reading the rave reviews and seeing the most amazing spread of appetizers and entrees on the dinner menu, I gathered a couple of my colleagues and went down the street.  I would make a reservation, as this place can get packed even on the weekdays.  If there is a wait, you can wait by the bar that has ample space.

This is a nice place to take a date, but is well-suited for group dinners as well.  The atmosphere is comfortable and kind of has a woodsy feeling.  The lighting is perfect - not too bright and not too dim.

Note that their online menu may not reflect the menu they have for the week, which changes.  Also, they may run out of dishes as the night goes on, i.e, shrimp and octopus.

To start, we got the ceviche, which was perfectly marinated in a tangy lime sauce.  The scallops and yellowtail they used was fresh.  I don't recall seeing any shrimp in it, though.  Comes with a delicate shallot cracker.

For my entree, I ordered the rabbit.  The rabbit was some of the best I've had.  Tasted like it was slightly smoked.  It was well seasoned and soft and cooked to the right temperature.  I've never had rabbit so substantial before - it was so much meat!

Dessert was a highlight.  They were out of the pecan pie and the caramel tart, but to our surprise, their other desserts were just as amazing.  The homemade cinnamon honey ice cream was absolutely delicious.  It wasn't too much cinnamon and tasted a bit like horchata - SO GOOD.  The panna cotta was some of the best I've ever had - not too heavy at all and melts in your mouth. Since they ran out of so many things, they doubled up the chocolate duo dessert for us.  The multi-layered espresso cake reminded me a bit of tiramisu and had a wonderful chocolate ganache on top.  The chocolate semifreddo had a delicious crust and the semifreddo itself melted in your mouth.

I will absolutely return to Halcyon to try the stuff that we weren't able to try this evening.

Also, excellent, friendly service.),(Another Charlotte Restaurant Week experience!

Again, it is my personal belief a participating restaurant should put their best foot (or dishes, for that matter) forward during restaurant week. It's two weeks out of the year, folks. Do it up and do it right.

That being said, I was absolutely jacked to try The Mint Museum's newest addition - Halcyon! Their fresh (no freezer on site) farm to table concept is just as lovely as their decor. Gorgeous twig chandeliers, lots of deep, rich browns, ocean blue wall, interesting silverware and more. Plus, that patio is going to be stunning during the warmer months. Service was friendly and efficient and we were in and out within an hour. I can, however, imagine staying a while once CRW is over. 

The food, however, is where Halcyon fell a bit short of wondrous, both in flavor and in portion sizes. I see on their Yelp biz categories they listed small plates and new American, perhaps I should have paid more attention to the small plate mention. 

Listen, I don't expect grandiose portions, but I left Halcyon hungry. That's sayin' a lot. Here's what I had:

Amuse Bouche - Hummus w\/pita points: 3\/5: This was actually a generous helping of hummus, especially for an amuse bouche. Our server brought us extra pita points because the heaping pile of hummus only came with three. Ha. I love carbs, I'd like some extra pita. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the hummus,

Farm Salad: 4\/5: Local butter lettuce with a few sunflower seeds, tasty tomatoes and a delicious mustard vinaigrette. Great texture and full of color. I really, really enjoyed the dressing. 

Short Rib: 3.5\/5: Let me put this out there right away - I love the flavors on the plate. Loved the tender short rib, the tasty glaze, the potato puree and the root veggies. My problem with this dish? There wasn't much of it. At all. Three very small slices of short rib, two bites of potato and the equivalent of two baby carrots diced. Normally I offer hubs a few bites of my dish, but I didn't have any to share. Color me disappointed, but they said this was supposed to be a main course*? Maybe I got the runt of the short rib  - it was very short. 

*In the same vein, hubs ordered the chicken and I chuckled when they set it down. The chicken was the size of a kiwi with a protruding bone. 

Creme Brulee: 2\/5: Very cold inside and the texture was pretty off. Not smooth, creamy and delicious as I had hoped. Plus, the flavor was lacking. 

So, maybe I should have paid more attention to the small plate classification? I'll take a bit of the blame, but that could have been advertised a bit better on their CRW menu and website, for that matter. I know I'll come back to Halcyon as I really adore the concept, but I'll be sure to have a snack before I arrive.),(Halcyon is a beautiful restaurant, there is a patio that screams, ""cocktails.""  Went in today to meet a friend for lunch, I was a little early and hadn't had any coffee yet, very happy to relax (text and email furiously on my phone), you know relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.  

Service was very nice, no rushing or acting weird because I was taking up a table, he served me a beautiful cup of coffee.  Freshly made, strong, served in a large, simple, ceramic cup.  It was the best cup of coffee I've had in Charlotte in a restaurant setting that didn't specialize in coffee. Shockingly delicious.  Then I wondered how much it was going to be...  two bucks. I can afford that!  

My friend arrived we ordered a few items to nosh on, French onion soup and a grilled scallop and brussel sprout dish.  They brought me the wrong item, the server was really nice about, the food runner was prompt in taking care of it and my scallop dish came out really fast.  Handled very professionally.

I cannot wait to go back, the first sign of warmer weather, you can meet me at the Mint!),(This time it was only drinks at the bar.  Due to the limited menu and higher than normal prices, I cannot afford to eat here all the time, so just cocktails this time and finally found out they have their freezer, so ice cream is available....my next to do the next time I'm there.),(What a fantastic find - thank you, OpenTable!  A coworker and I checked this place out on Tuesday night and had a great experience - everything was top notch!

The decor is just beautiful - I loved the fabrics, wood tables, chandeliers...everything!

Our server was great!  He truly explained the menu, made recommendations and certainly didn't steer us wrong.

And...the food!  So good...we shared the fried green tomatoes and the special tomato salad, each tried the trout and the pork special and shared the peach cobbler.  If I lived in Charlotte, I would go here often as it is that good!

Thank you for a great evening!),(A large group of us stopped in a few weeks ago and took the large center table in the dining area.  3 hours and a stack of cash later we were full and happy.

The Highlights:
+  Cheese tray was impressive (we went with every cheese they had)
+  My duck entree was perfectly cooked, tender, and was a shining example of how duck should be prepared.
+  Nice wine options in the $10-$15 a glass range.
+  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  The lighting, the table, the high ceiling.  It worked.
+  Scallop and Pork Belly was spot on.  
+  Hamachi - clean and fresh tasting.  I enjoyed it.
+  My bacon cocktail was awesome.  Mmm... bacon...

The Meh:
o  The snackboard was a miss.  The farro was overcooked and the eggplant was a bit bitter (and had a funky texture) .

The Fail:
-  The foie gras boudin blanc with my duck was awful.  Bitter, funky, and not good.  I had one bite and left the rest.  **Note** I am a fan of foie gras AND have never met a boudin blanc I didn't like... until this.

Overall it was an impressive meal and it ended up being a great time.  Thanks to the staff and team that made the experience so great.),(Upscale dining even during lunch. Earth tones, wood, metal, stone, large, open dining room and flood to ceiling glass windows; the space is simply blissful. Add great food and delicious wine, you have a little sanctuary here. 

The service was on point; friendly, efficient, prompt and accommodating...all things that make me happy. Halcyon sits atop the extraordinary Mint Museum offering a beautiful view of the downtown Charlotte area and just a few steps away from some of the city's most amazing art forms. 

I wanted to keep it light so I opted for the Spinach Salad which included goat cheese, hard boiled egg, sunflower seeds, roasted mushrooms and succulent scallops paired with Chateaumar, a French red wine silky and divine! I am highly addicted to dark chocolate and absolutely love truffles so dessert was a no brainer....an adorable truffle board garnished with fresh berries and powered sugar, also perfectly paired with a glass of Chateaumar.  Needless to say I did not want to leave Halcyon. EVER. I will be on the lookout for locations in other cities. If you are on a budget bypass Halcyon, my lunch alone was $50 before gratuity. 

~Christy),(Despite the weird fucking name, I really like this place.  Walking in was like wow, beautiful decor, inside and out.  Inside was like being in some crazy woodland adventure with snow white while on crack.  Outside was more subdued and got great views.  At 3pm they told us the menu was limited and we can only get like 6 things.  My friend got the pork belly and I got the oxtail.  Let's just say, both dishes blew my fucking mind.  ESPECIALLY the pork belly.  Every bite, with the sauce, was phenomenal.  And the dishes aren't large so I was suspicious that we'd still be hungry but we were surprisingly full.

It was a busy Friday night and being a former waitress I can understand being in the weeds, but my table was definitely sacrificed.  I was so excited to have the carpaccio it is one of my favorite things on the menu but it never came, are dirty martini's were not dirty - and the food overall was just blah this time around.  i guess it was just an off night.  The table next to us seemed to have a similar experience.),(On an evening where basically every other restaurant was packed full (aka Valentine's Day), Customshop was one of basically no restaurants with reservations left.  Me, being semi-anal about having actual reservations before going anywhere that is going to be packed, plucked the last available spot on OpenTable.  

The restaurant itself is conveniently located in Elizabeth (close enough to Uptown) along a street with many other popular restaurants such as Carpe Diem and Passion8.  The lighting is pretty dim, but it matches the atmosphere of the restaurant, which isn't too loud or too quiet, but just right... maybe because the entire restaurant was of couples? We were seated closely to another table, but didn't have to listen to their conversation the whole night.  Our server, Zoe, was an absolutely delight and was super friendly to us the whole evening.  The drinks took a little long to arrive, but it may have been because it was a full house... so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

As for food, we chose to order a bunch of small plates and one main entree:
- Tuna crudo - slightly different texture than what I'm used to, but the flavor was okay.  Could have been a bit more tangy
- Beef carpaccio - holy moly this was the motherlode of all beef carpaccios.  It's a LOT for two people.  
- Razor clams - best flavor of the night, but some of them were a little overcooked and very chewy
- Pork belly - could have been a little more melt-in-your-mouth and was rather bland
- BBQ octopus - I was a little apprehensive about ordering BBQ anything, but this actually turned out to be the best dish of the evening.  I liked that it had a little kick to it and was more flavorful than the other dishes
- Smoked duck - cooked just right... loved the crispy skin.

Overall, the food was a bit lackluster in that many of the dishes simply were not flavorful, salty enough, or just quite bland.

BUT... for dessert, I ordered the brownie souffle with coffee ice cream and that solved all my issues for the night. The souffle was the perfect amount of chocolate - not too rich, and just melty enough.  The cold ice cream and the melty goodness of the souffle complemented each other so well. I ate the entire thing by myself, thanks to my dinner companion that evening, and have zero regrets!

Excellent service and atmosphere, blandish food, but amazing dessert.  Prices were reasonable.),(Meat and cheese and wine, oh my! Customshop is the place the hubs and I will visit for a hefty serving of all of the above. While we've had a full meal here, I think they shine with their appetizers and wine selections. Their meat and cheese boards as well as their crudo, are fantastic. If you're a Kobe beef fan, their carpaccio is very good, too. The menu items are definitely not cheap, but I'm ok with that because of their local focus and quality.

I know that they update their menu with seasonal (and usually local) offerings and each app has been delicious. Definitely ask your server or bartender about wine and cheese\/meat pairings. The servers are certainly educated and each one has been very friendly. Their bartenders are also very talented - I had the most amazing Blood Orange martini that the bartender made off the cuff. 

Inside Customshop is, as Veronica O. says, a great dark bistro. It's definitely got some mood lighting, dark wood booths and a plethora of candles. Romantico! 

On a few side notes, I've also been there for brunch and I wasn't overly impressed. I had their brioche french toast with marscapone and it was lacking in the marscapone department. Major bummer for a cheese and sweet lover like myself. 


Also, I think this restaurant was really hurting the past year due to all of the construction on Elizabeth Ave. - now that the trolley work is done, I'm really hoping they pick back up. I'll definitely head back over to Customshop for a martini and a big slab of proscuitto and cheese.),(So having not been here since the last Yelp event, we decided to check out the place and have a little dinner.  Having not checked out the menu before we went in, we discovered the pricing to be a bit on the high end, though all the food and dishes are made via Slow food and local fare, we sat there wondering if droping close to $80 on food and drinks made sense?

So instead we opted for small plate items and side dishes and in the end we were full, had some nice cheese, meats, and side dishes along with the mussels all for a lot less than the $26+ entrees they have on their menu.

Server wasn't sure what to do with us when we ordered that way, but in the end came around and did a good job waiting on us.

Nice place, lovely space, great food.),(When the big eyeball emojis are staring at you from the table, take that as an indication to order some wine. 

Other than that, listen carefully to the specials your waiter tells you about. There are some winners there that you should take note of. 

Our dining experience here was excellent, mostly due to our awesome server who we all pretty much were crushing on in a 90s sitcom kind of way. He was funny, charming and overall, on top of his game. 

I went a little bit out of my normal lane and ordered the Squid Ink Linguine alla Chitarra. Didn't really think I could go wrong with squid ink and shellfish, but must not have read through the description carefully enough and to my surprise, came in a red sauce. It was tasty and made sense with the sausage also in there, but pretty much me and everyone at the table were a little surprised. (Looking back at the description, it's not completely clear but I should have asked.)

My friends ordered the scallops and risotto, which I believe was one of the specials. One bite of it gave me food envy, so if it was on the menu I would definitely re-order that again for myself.

Overall, the small plates were a highlight for me, with the BBQ Octopus and Burrata as the two standouts of the night for me. Obviously, there are just enough for a few bites each if shared, however small but mighty definitely applied to both.),(I haven't had a really fabulous main dish like this in a long time! Especially one where I truly wanted to lick the plate after I was done. Hats off to you Customshop, because I will think of you and drool.

I ordered the special, the scallops and risotto. Scallops were light and fluffy, the way they should be, as well as the risotto being a nice creamy texture. Seriously, plate licking should have been involved.

We also ordered a round of apps for the table. The burrata was good, although not as creamy and rich as I remember others being. The squid was good too, but it wasn't impressive like my dish was. This however will not change my view that this is a solid restaurant to visit! 

Service was stellar, as our server was super friendly and attentive. He did a good job of suggestions on food and drinks. So good that I left definitely feeling very happily buzzed on some great wine. Whoops!),(So have been traveling back and forth to charlotte for work lately and while out in the city in February, we decided to go take an early night and grab a bite to eat at a local joint. The options were limited given the last minute booking but customshop was available so we decided to give it a shot. We walked over from the Sheraton (would recommend uber for those in downtown directly). The walk was pleasant from the hotel and we were soon upon the small strip of hip restaurants around. Was able to find this spot quickly for our reservation and were greeted promptly upon entering the joint.
 
The space itself is a ""long restaurant"" and therefore stretches back. I was pretty excited to see a well stocked bar as I need to have my whiskey neats flowing for any night (don't judge). Our server was an absolute gem (Zoe) and was very friendly the entire time. She was a sweetheart and wish that all of you are lucky enough to have her as your server! After looking through the menu, we decided to order the tuna crudo, beef carpaccio, razor clams, pork belly, bbq octopus, and the smoked duck. The portions for all the dishes were solid but there seemed to be a slight lack of kick to a lot of the flavors leaving it a bit short of what I had expected for each dish. The tuna was OK but I wish there was a bit more tang with either some type of vinaigrette or something else to give it a bit of jazz. The Carpaccio was good but the portion was a bit off putting and it was hard to finish all of the dish. The razor clams were a welcome addition, however some of the clams were cooked better than others leaving a hodge podge experience. The ones that were cooked well were quite delicious while the opposite left a chewy texture. The pork belly was a heaping piece of meat but again there was something missing from kicking some flavor into it. The BBQ octopus was an interesting take and was probably one of my more favorite items despite me not liking octopus that much. The smoked duck was delish and something I would definitely get so was glad to have the two items be a solid contender.

All in all, this place was just OK for me as it relates to food. There is so much potential and the service was phenomenal so hopefully with a menu shift they are able to add some ""jazz"" to the food to kick it up a notch. Prices were reasonable for the food as well which was a nice plus.)"
sdYkVaTy7EJwUkO8Ie_qPg,"Restaurants, Peruvian",Charlotte,1,35.2134205994,-80.826022401,Viva Chicken,849,4.5,"(Parking for Viva Chicken was a super hassle. Ugh, I didn't have any coins for the meter and then I had to install some app on my phone and then create an account and the whole time I'm hoping a meter maid doesn't come by.

Okay, enough unrelated nonsense. Viva Chicken is right across the way from the Presbyterian Hospital's main lobby entrance. Inside dining and outside on their small patio. Order at the register and pay, get your drink filled and then your food's brought to you a bit later.

I chose ""The Great"" sandwich - a good portion of pulled chicken with the usual lettuce and tomato on a toasted ciabatta roll. It was excellent. The chicken was nice and moist with a good flavor. For my side, I chose the sweet plaintains which were perfect. Plump and juicy and really flavorful.

A great sandwich, I'll hope to be back here again!),(Viva Chicken, I can't quit you.

The quinoa stuffed avocado is still my obsession. I love that there is a half order option. Make sure to add chicken to it. Add to that obsession list- the fried rice. During my most recent visit, one of the workers brought me a sauce from the kitchen. Game changer. It's like a hoisin type and is absolutely delicious. Sadly, it was just a seasonal sauce they had for a salad. I'm a big fan of all the sauces here. They're all so different and tasty. The chicken is amazing. I don't think there's a wrong way to order here. The herbal limeade and passion fruit juices are made in house. Note: there's no free refills on those specialty drinks. So, show some restraint and don't chug your drink. 

This place gets pretty busy, so I typically get my food to go. You can order online for pick up now. All the workers here are really nice. It's one of those places where you can't help but leave happy.),(I'm a long-time lover of Peruvian cuisine and anything that even hints at having plantains, yucca, rotisserie\/grilled chicken, and South American pastries....or anything with ""Dulce de Leche"" in the name. I'm a sucker, I know, but Viva exudes all of the aspects of a staple in town for a quick-service resto. It was pretty astonishing to learn that this joint is totally Charlotte-based. 

There are so many things that gave this experience 5 out of 5 for me. 

Service: Holy cow. The woman at the register was super helpful. She gave me some background on everything I had questions about. I'm a firm believer that the more questions you ask, the more likely you are to find out what you'll end up loving. The gentleman working the line was equally helpful. He gave us some background on the housemade drinks, Inca Kola (tastes exactly like bubblegum, by the way), other processes, Peruvian cuisine, and the back story. They give you a number if you dine in and bring your order to your table. They were even so kind to spell everything out, give some info on flavors of the different Aji (sauces), and came back to ask how everything was. Top notch service indeed. 

The flavors. Oh, my. First, The Great. This is the staple chicken sandwich under this roof and it's a force of culinary nature. It all starts in the ""Green Oven"" they have straight from Peru. It's a rotisserie\/grill hybrid that gives the chicken immaculate flavor. Imagine pulled, tender, juicy chicken with charred flavor and absolutely no compromise in texture\/chew. I was astounded. It is served on ciabatta with red onion, tomatoes, and a spread of some sauce. Add avocado and provalone. You won't be sorry you did. 

The yucca and plantains were top notch. Dunked heavily in the Aji Amarillo and the green Aji sauce. I'd eat these with every meal. 

We also ordered the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Sounds odd, looks odd, tastes AMAZING. Balsamic is a nice touch. Don't be scared. Just try it if it's your style. 

The alfajores, shortbread cookies with dulce de leche, are incredible. Coated in powdered sugar and only beckon a tall glass of milk. Buy them in two or four packs. They make these suckers in-house, too. 

Inca Kola. Loved it, so interesting, can't wait to have it again. Ever wondered what a liquid version of Bazooka bubblegum would taste like? Here ya go. 

Prices vary on dishes. Some of the entrees are a little more pricey (as expected) and the sandwiches, sides, and apps are a bit more modest in price. Definitely a little more pricey than some, but you can get out the door with a meal under your belt for between $10-$15 no problem.

The whole experience was awesome. I loved all of the background on the concept, preparation, kitchen, etc. Such a nice dinner and I'm already planning a menu for my next visit. That chicken is just too damn good to not be in my life. Viva...Viva Chicken indeed!),(Bored of eating the same old sub or salad everyday for lunch?  Me too, I  really needed some new lunch choices and something close to work and boy oh boy was I happy to find Viva Chicken.  If you haven't tried Peruvian food yet then this is your chance, and you will not be disappointed. 

Thanks to JJ G.'s review I went for the Tacu Bowl (but with chicken) for me!  It's the delicious green sauce that really made the dish, I don't recall the name but I'll take a gallon of it please.  Fresh avocados and plenty of food to fill this hungry belly.  The menu has plenty of options even for the picky eaters out there.  I also noticed a summer menu at the register featuring some good looking salads.  

While looking around the restaurant you can see just about every patron munching on the Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian rotisserie chicken) I know this is the thing to get at this restaurant and I can't wait to get back to try it.  You can even order a whole chicken and sides to go walla dinner is served. 

For lunch or dinner Viva is a great choice the outdoor patio is awesome and filled with plants and cute decor.  Even though it's counter service you still feel like your getting full service at you table.  Fast, healthy, and authentic just what I was looking for!),(Excellent food!  My son took a bite of ""the great"" and you would have thought he'd never eaten food before.   I had the chicken salad and it was very good, the presentation seemed old on first take as the balsamic dressing was rather clumpy and the lettuce was just a huge mound of just lettuce with a few feta cheese pieces but again very good taste overall.),(I've been hearing about Viva Chicken since I started traveling down here for work over a year ago and I only just now tried it today.  Why that is... I have no idea.  I feel like I've been missing out on life for so long.  I first attempted to order via Postmates, but the place was so busy that they cancelled my order and stopped taking new ones.  So... I hopped in an Uber and made the short drive over to the restaurant and picked up my phoned-in order.

The minute I walked into the restaurant I knew I'd made a good decision.  The place was insanely busy and it smelled amazing.  I was able to quickly pick up my order via the dedicated order pick up line.  Make sure you throw utensils inside because they didn't include any with my takeout order.

I ordered a 1\/4 chicken combo (comes with 2 sides for under $9!) with a chicken soup and sweet potato fries.  The rotisserie chicken here is probably the best I've had anywhere, including a few Peruvian restaurants in NYC.  It was extremely flavorful and almost didn't need any sauce to go with it.  The chicken soup was also delicious, but for some reason all the veggies were almost raw - not sure if it's supposed to be like this.  The sweet potato fries are pretty standard and slightly soggy.. might taste better if you dined in.  

They have 3 sauces with different bases, but you can choose from mild, medium, and spicy.  I went with medium, which was a lime\/cilantro flavor with a kick as well as the spicy, which was more creamy and pepper based.  I liked both, but neither are like the green sauce I've had at other Peruvian places.

I saw a lot of people get their fresh drinks... may have to try that next time too.

Overall, an excellent deal for delicious rotisserie chicken and sides.  The menu is pretty clean too and nothing too unhealthy (you can choose all white meat, too).  YUM!),(Round up your llamas! This Peruvian place is legit! 
I know my Peruvian food. I've spent time eating ""Cuey"" in Cusco. Cuey is the national food of Peru, guinea pig. Unfortunately, this restaurant doesn't serve Cuey. But they do have some amazing Peruvian food. 
The quinoa stuffed avocados were amazing. They put some chicken in with the quinoa, and the avocado was grilled to perfection. It was delightful. 
We split a half-chicken, the stuffed avocado along with some yucca fries and fried plantains. The food was marvelous. Seriously delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The avocado was stuffed with quinoa and chicken, and roasted. 
The best part of this place is the sauces. They have a variety of authentic Peruvian sauces of varying tastes and levels of heat. None of them are incredibly hot. 
The service was great, and the decor was interesting. 
I saw that they even sell Inca Cola, the Peruvian version of Mountain Dew. It's awesome.),(I am ever-passionate about Peruvian chicken. I grew up eating the tenderly roasted delicacy and consider myself a true pollo rico fan. While I'm more accustomed to authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by the Viva Chicken approach. 

Seemingly out of a cool California operation, with its eco-chic interior and practices. Celebrating sustainable and recyclable practices, Viva seems to care about its impact on the environment and clearly has a heart too. On a select weekday night, they'll feed someone in need for free.  

To acquire some of the best chicken you're bound to ever eat, simply place your order at the counter and then patiently wait for your take out or dine in (should you choose to stick around, there's indoor and patio seating available). I opted for the pollo a la brasa (1\/4 white meat) and 2 sides (cilantro infused rice with canary beans). While it plays host to fast food ordering, the dishes taste anything but rushed. For a mere $7.95, I dove in to my meal and compare it to the best of places I've visited. Were I to call myself a Charlotte resident, Viva would be in regular rotation.),(Got it to go so I can't speak to the actual restaurant inside or service but the food is some of the best I've had. Think chipolte meets Peru. Great portion for your less than $10 price and the sauces are amazing. The food is absolutely yummy without the three sauces but I couldn't get enough of the sauces. I wish I lived in Charlotte and could get this more often.),(When I am in the Carolinas, I usually look for barbecue or for Southern comfort food (frahd chicken and banayna puddin', in particular). Although I am aware that Charlotte is a major city and home to several global financial institutions, I still was not expecting to be so deeply enamored with a Peruvian restaurant in North Carolina.

Viva Chicken is somewhat of a local chain that serves up a fantastic pollo a la brasa (tender, moist, tasty, honest-to-goodness, rotisserie chicken rubbed with a mildly spicy seasoning). The arroz chaufa (China Peruana fried rice) with pulled pollo a la brasa is another hit. What takes all this deliciousness to the next level of awesomeness is the house made sauces. The roasted rocoto sauce is the spiciest but also packed with the most flavor. The aji amarillo is smooth and creamy with a slight kick. The huacatay is basically a blend of jalapeños and cilantro; spicy, but not that special. 

The alfajores (chewy shortbread cookies with dulce de leche - caramelized milk - sandwiched between them), are a great way to finish off the meal, and the passion fruit juice and chicha morada are instant refreshment in the North Carolina heat.)"

It hasn't changed at all. My daughter and I ended up in one of the booths along the wall.

The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.

My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.

Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.

Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.

If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way.)"

I'm not from Philly, I've never had a cheesesteak in the city of Philadelphia. So, I'm definitely by no means a connoisseur when it comes to this. I will say, it's a damn good sandwich at a damn good price. I'm a huge fan of the burger here as well. Their fries are hand cut. I always say I'm going to order something different here on my next visit, but I can't quite that philly. 

This is a grab and go kind of place. There's only a couple tables and they are outside. I like to take my food over to Romare Bearden and eat in the park. If you don't work uptown, skip the parking decks and look for a spot on one of the nearby streets. The Park Mobile app makes it easy to pay and it's super cheap (it's like $1.12 an hour and you can add more time from your phone).

Since this Boneheads is (currently) the only one in Charlotte, I wanted to check it out one sunny afternoon strolling around Ballantyne...

The ambiance is super clean, efficient and plenty of seating. You'll see tons of bright colors, tables (both high and low) and a couple of big booths. The menu is chock full of fishes. Fishes of all sorts, cooked in a variety of ways. Hubs wanted to start with the crispy shrimp app (tossed in a spicy aioli with a hint of Piri Piri) and while it's definitely not a health-conscious choice, it was damn tasty. Lightly fried shrimp with a spicy glaze...party in my mouth time. 

For my lunch I went with the grilled mahi. All fish is chargrilled and lightly seasoned with Boneheads' special spices and come with seasoned rice, choice of a topping and a side. I chose the pineapple salsa topping and grilled zucchini strips. The fish was perfectly grilled and the pineapple salsa was very fresh and a perfect accompaniment. The rice was meh and while the zucchini strips were nice, grilled and crunchy, they were more akin to zucchini logs than strips. It was a bit tough to cut through them!

Overall, Boneheads serves up fast and fresh grilled fish that will please many. Be aware that it's not the cheapest option on the block - but for a nice piece of grilled fish and plenty of sides, it's a healthy, tasty choice.),($3 fish tacos were really nice & I would come back for them. The Asian slaw was delicious & has me craving more as I type. 

The outdoor seating is lovely with overhead string bulb lights & a fountain which would make for a romantic setting in the evenings. I did notice the service was quite slow so make sure you're not in a rush.

It's a bit expensive for a meal but you're getting nice quality fish and goodies. They have a small beer & wine selection in addition to sodas.)"

Extremely loud music and really, not all that good. But we had a couple of beers and managed to shout over the racket for a bit.

If you're planning a visit, I'd recommend avoiding the band. Why does it have to be so damn loud?),(While EpiCentre can be a little crazy on some evenings, filled with youngins poppin' their collars and drinking entirely too much, BlackFinn has always been a solid stop for me. 

I've been here a few times for drinks with friends (not super late into the evening, mind you) and once for lunch. Both visits I enjoyed great service, a fun & vibrant atmosphere and limited engagements with 22 year old party kids. A few things to note...

1) The space itself is great. I haven't made my way upstairs yet, but I've heard it can be a fun time. Downstairs is more akin to a pub atmosphere...plenty of TVs, booths and high tops to grab a seat. This space can get pretty crowded when a popular game is on, so just be patient and polite. Or go somewhere else.
2) Their fries are goooooood. Really good. Especially after a few bevvies. 
3) When I popped by for lunch, I had the roasted veggie pizza. Damn, Gina! It was super flavorful, generous in portion and filling. I would absolutely go back just for that reason alone. 

Keep an eye out for drink & food specials as well as plenty of event nights here. I hear they are offering a champagne special for ladies coming up in April?! Yes please. Bubbles. Now.),(I had two completely different experiences at BlackFinn.  

Experience #1:  Upstairs about an hour prior to close.  It was DEAD.  The one server working was robotic and clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed.  I was impressed that she could breathe, however, since she had her bewbs pushed up to her throat.  Seriously kid, this isn't Hooters.  

The drinks were overpriced, but the food was decent.  The frat-boy types at the bar, hooting and hollering at the Braves game, made me wish for industrial strength rubber bands  (either to shoot at them, or to shoot at myself.  Either way, I'd have been distracted).

Experience #2:  Downstairs after the upstairs had closed.  The prices were still too damn high (more expensive than my local bar in midtown Manhattan!), but the server down here was a complete doll!  If I would have known the  bottom part was so awesome, I would have come here right from the start.

Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.

Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.

Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.

Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly.),(Like a fine wine... this place just keeps getting better with age.

Now three plus years old, Pisces has expanded into the space next door to create a trendy bar and lounge area.

Cocktail genius Bob Peters continues to pull more tricks out of his bag. If you go to this place and order a Bud Light- you're doing it wrong. This is what real bartending is all about. Whether he's using a carbonator, playing with new liquor infusions or adding smoke to a cocktail... put your drink decisions in this man's hands. Intimidated? Tell him what you like. He'll come up with the perfect concoction for you.

Hungry? The best bang for your buck happens at lunch with the all you can eat sushi deal for $14.

My biggest problem at Pisces is narrowing down my order. I have to issue self-imposed restrictions or I will easily convince myself that I need five rolls. They're all delish but here are my current three favs (yes they change every few months):

Leo (tuna, mango, avocado and chili oil). I love the chili oil kick of this one.

Kissy (mango, crab, cream cheese in soy paper, re-wrapped with basil and rice paper) There is just something so clean and delicious about this roll.

XoXo (crab, avocado, topped with baked scallop and a honey mayo eel sauce) The topping just takes this roll to a new level.

I'm also a big of the Tuna Bruschetta for starters and Tempura Oreo with green tea ice cream for the grand finale. 

For the late night crowd, Pisces also serves food til 2AM on weekends.

It'll hypnotize you for hours.),(I've been a long-standing fan of Pisces and can't believe that I haven't written a review until now. Easily one of the best places to eat at The Met and happy to say that they have some of the better sushi in town for the price. Also, with the $14 all-you-can-eat sushi during the week, it's a solid joint for lunch, too. 

Recently came in for dinner with the Mrs and we enjoyed our time heartily. 

Tempura Veg - Stellar
Cali Roll - Textbook
Spicy Tuna Roll - Perfect
Screaming ""O"" Roll - Not my favorite, but I had heard quite a bit about it and had to try it. There happened to be a minute amount of wasabi lurking somewhere within, so I wasn't too keen on the flavor. Other than that, great stuff. 
Cocktails - The Fresh Fruit Gin Fizz and Pocket Fours are both wonderful. Nothing fancy, just served in a pint glass with tons of freshness. Not too boozy either. I'd order both again in a heartbeat. 

The service was great as well. Our server was nice and to the point. Not too much nonsense or over-communication, which I appreciate. 

Pisces is a great choice for sushi and cocktails. Also, never had the chance to witness him in his element behind the bar, but I know Bob Peters slings a mighty fine beverage.),(Boo - I guess I knew going in for the all you can eat sushi for $12 was a little too good to be true...my instinct was right.  The plus was the atmosphere I think the restaurant was decorated very hip and they had these really neat little booths.  The sushi was not good though you could have served balls of rice and it would have been equivalent to what I received.. The nigiri pieces I did get didn't taste very fresh which is always a bad sign for me when I'm eating sushi.  

But I still would be willing to give this place another chance perhaps for dinner and ordering off the full menu.  I've seen some good reviews on this place and don't want one bad experience to scare me away.),(Another sushi bar in Charlotte, ok, sure, I'll bite! 

Never one to turn down any sushi experience, hubs and I rolled into Pisces to grab a quick, light dinner. The interior is modern, but more casual (and a bit smaller) than I anticipated. Regardless, we were seated right away and greeted within minutes. Our server was quite friendly and offered a few roll suggestions when asked. The sushi menu is pretty extensive, but at least half of the rolls have either cream cheese or some fried element in them. Not my favorite types - I prefer fresh fish and spices to cream cheese and fried goodness. At least in my sushi. 

Soy paper is available for $1, which is a nice addition for those who aren't seaweed fans. Hubs and I tried just two rolls, the First Love - crab, avocado, shrimp, mango, and the Rainbow Roll - California roll with assorted fresh fish on top. Both rolls were well-made and the fish was supremely fresh. Overall, the rolls are priced fairly all around. 

I read about the $9 All You Can Eat sushi lunch buffet and I'd definitely like to check that out when my tummy's a-rumblin'.),(Some fantastic specials everyday, is one reason why Pisces has easily become one of my favorites in Charlotte, and I haven't been here two weeks yet! My new friend took here in my first weekend in town, and now I'm kinda hooked on Pisces. Also, Pisces is my sign ha ;) 

We went on a Saturday for a late lunch and it was packed. Thankfully, we were seated right away. I got the Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi entree, which was served with garlic noodles (extra $1) along with miso soup and ginger salad. Also, we had an order of Crab Dumplings to share, and Holy Moly, those were ridiculously delicious! 

Pro-tip: Check out their made to order all-you-can-eat Sushi lunch for $11.00\/person: with 26 Sushi rolls options (all rolls are 1\/2 of a full roll: aka 4 pieces-which you can't get it to-go btw) and kitchen items like fried wonton strips, fried rice, garlic rice, veg. spring rolls and fried pork. However:
- Keep in mind you might be fined for all-you-CAN'T-eat-Sushi if you wasted too much food, as they're trying to avoid food wastage. 
- Nigiri cost $5 extra.

I love sushi and their lunch buffet is excellent. It's always fresh and they have great selections and a great value.

What I like about Pho Hong is that they do indeed have a lot more dishes than say, Pho Hoa down the street, including dishes such as Bun Bo Hue and Bun Rieu.  They also have authentic Vietnamese desserts and drinks.

The restaurant is fairly large and is located in the same shopping center as Food Lion.  Plenty of parking all around.

One of the things that stood out the most to me here was not their food, but their friendly service.  Everyone at the restaurant, especially the waitress, which I assume might be one of the owners, was extremely friendly and always smiling. 

As for the food, is it slightly more pricey than most Vietnamese I've had both in the South and in NYC.  A bun bo hue and bun rieu cost over $10 each bowl.  The bun rieu I had didn't have as much of the shrimpy\/fishy flavor I was looking for and was way too salty.  The bun bo that my friend ordered tasted more like a pho with spicy sauce rather than a lemongass soup base.  That's not to say that the food was bad... I just came with high expectations given the many, many Vietnamese restaurants I've been to as well as my own personal past, growing up with a ton of Vietnamese friends in Georgia.

We had the goi cuon (shrimp summer rolls) to start and the ingredients were fresh and the rice paper perfectly moist.  We also had an egg soda (raw egg yolk, lime (?), condensed milk, and club soda - this was surprisingly very refreshing and tasty.  Neither of us had had this before.  For dessert, we had a ""che"" - Vietnamese desserts - coconut milk, crushed ice, red bean, jello squiggles, and mung bean - it was sweet and my friend absolutely loved this stuff.

Overall, my friend (who is Caucasian in case you were wondering) really liked the food.  I introduced him to several ""weird"" foods including blood cake, and he even thought that was okay.  Perhaps it takes a more complex palate to detect the minor differences between good Vietnamese food and mediocre Vietnamese food.)"

I've been a big fan of the original Peel in Cotswold for years. Confession: I use to order $40 worth of food so Foodie Call would deliver to me. So, yeah I've been pumped and counting the days for this new location to open.

My hands down favorite pizza here: Thai's Tong. Chicken, Thai sweet chili sauce, basil, onions, red pepper. The sauce just makes this pizza pop. Yum. In 92 pt font. First runner up: the buffalo chicken. Nachos are great. Bruschetta is addicting. Once I start eating it... I can't seem to stop.

The inside looks amazing. Walls are wood. They brought in an old piano from The Common Market in South End. Peel plans to bring in someone who can play it. What else can you expect? Music trivia nights, a ton of great beer. All of the beer. The GM knows more about beer than any other person I know. 

One thing though bums me out: the location does not have my favorite menu item. Sad face. I love the curry rolls at the Cotswold location. I dream about them sometimes. They take awhile to make, so currently they can't handle both locations. My fingers are crossed that this somehow changes in the future.

Congratulations on Peel #2. This city is a better place with not one, but two of you.),(Always been a huge fan of The Pizza Peel and was lucky enough to check out the new spot in Plaza upon a recent weekend visit. It's the same as the good ol' original in Cotswold, but with a slightly different interior layout and a much more awesome patio. 

Same great beer selection, amazing fish tacos (of which I will argue are the best in town), and that killer Secret Pizza Menu. Definitely worth a gander if you've never had a chance to do so. 

The factor that makes me want this location in the ATL is the disc golf basket out front. Not only is it a perfect distraction for the kids to go out and play, but it's a great way to kill some time al fresco with a beer in hand. Really love what they've done with this spot. A definite plus to the choices in Plaza.),(If you know me, you know much I love Pizza. However, Pizza Peel did not appeal to me. Probably because I'm more of a thin-crust-lover?!

The Great:
+  Our server was great.  She was friendly and helpful, if a bit over-eager to make sure everything was OK.  
+  WiFi.  Thanks for letting us work over our lunch!

The Average:
o  Typical pizza joint menu, but on the upside they had quite a few toppings available.

The Meh:
-  Mediocre (at best) crust.  Doughy and lacking flavor.  No offense, but it reminded me of something you'd get at a grocery store.
-  The Toppings.  While the topping list was extensive, I was simply not blown away by the flavor.  What can I say, I'm a pizza snob.

Sorry Pizza Peel - just not for me.)"

I have been here before, but it was the first two for my two friends. They were skeptical when we parked. It only took five minutes of being inside to turn them into immediate fans. 

The beer selection is not only wide, it's filled with a lot of different and creative selections. There's craft beer here to satisfy anyone. I enjoyed a couple Noble Cider's Cherry Cider. 

The menu is perfect for a place like this. Flatbreads, piadina's (sandwiches with a few handcrafted ingredients), salads, cheese plates (with North Carolina cheeses), and charcuterie. The store portion of Craft doesn't have a huge selection, but it has some unique options. There are shelves of bottled beer options. 

The patio isn't huge, but it's simple and nice. As beautiful as it was yesterday, we actually opted to sit inside because we loved the vibe and feel.

But, we still had a great time with our friends to whom I owe the 5 stars versus Teds. 
The ambiance of this location is great (5\/5) and being a new store it was contemporary in design and the seating was laid out nicely.  Albeit the interior was smaller than I imagined it would be.  And the entrance does seem to be oddly located as noted in another review. 
Our server did an overall good job (4\/5) and apologetic when advising us the kitchen was just backed up, although the restaurant didn't seem that crazy from a volume perspective.

I'm always leary of visiting a newly opened restaurant within the first couple of weeks they are open because it's a learning experience even with trainers.

The East Cobb Ted's in Marietta is a favorite of mine and my son's family who lives in Marietta.

Last time we went, I played a trick on my wife. She was not feeling well so she stayed at the hotel and asked us to bring something back for her. Brought her back a great meatloaf which she enjoyed until I told her last night it was Bison. If looks could kill.

I was excited when I read last year that Ted's was coming to Charlotte. They opened a week ago last Wednesday.  Today we drove down from Cornelius to give them a try.

The Ted's in Marietta is nice but a bit dated while this one as you would expect is nice and fresh. Beautiful bar as you walk in and you are immediately at the hostess station. We were seated immediately in a booth on the edge of the main dining area. Nice dark woods and muted colors that work well together,

Our server was there immediately with menu's and to take our drink orders. She is good for the store in up selling because I had not thought about an appetizer till she mentioned it. Went for a cup of the Bison Chili and it was great. The slices of jalapeno made for a nice contrast in both taste and texture  The Bison Chili is reason enough to come here.

For my entree, I had a Knife and Fork Bison Chili Cheese Open Faced Sandwich with a 50\/50 side of fries and onion rings.  Portions were very large and it's a delicious concept. Really enjoyed that one.

My wife and a Black and Blue Steak Salad which she really liked.She asked for the Sirloin Steak to be cooked medium and it was exactly that. Again large portions.

Can't believe how well this place is run after such a short time in business. I've know a number of very good restaurant today that did not get their feet on the ground for several months after they opened.

Definitely a keeper and it was worth the drive down from Cornelius. We will be back.)"

Started with the ""knock out rolls."" Standard rice paper rolls with vermicelli rice noodles, tofu, cilantro, carrots and cucumber. The hoisin peanut sauce wasn't my favorite, but was reminiscent of other Thai places I've been to. These suckers were huge, too. Much bigger than your typical rice paper roll and the wrapper was a little more al dente, which I enjoyed. 

The Pho....just perfect. All of the standard fixin's and just right. Perfect for the colder air that has abounded as of late. 

My wife ordered the pineapple curry. Man, this was incredible. Coconut-y, creamy, with chunks of pineapple and great pieces of pan-fried tofu. Served with white rice. The flavors were so complex that each bite had a little more creamy, coconut flavor, or chili spice, pineapple and other spices. So creative and good. 

The service is stellar. So friendly and attentive. Your water cup will never be empty.

Seven cupcakes, three varieties. 

The kind employee mentioned that they were getting another batch of cupcakes around 6:30 pm...but unfortunately I didn't have 30 minutes to wait for a cupcake.

Not so much. The carrot cake was moist and well made but I expected more creme cheese in the frosting. 3.5\/5 for this one.

Wife had mint chocolate chip and I tried it and after my eyes stopped rolling to the back of my head, I realized it was GOOD.  They have a point program to earn a free scoop and it's reasonable as you don't need to purchase like 50 scoops to get one.  I believe it's 8 or 10.  I hope he's successful as he serves a very good product with matching service levels.)"

It's great to see Neapolitan type places popping up in the Charlotte area now. Desano has a handful of locations across the country. The space is pretty cool. Good sized, industrial chic with communal tables. Fantastic patio, garage doors. The kitchen is wide open. You order at the register and they bring your food out to you. 

Our order: the San Gennaro (cashier told me it was their most popular), Lasagna, and Capricciosa. The San Gennaro was the winner for me. I'm a sucker for a anything with peppadews. The Cappricciosa was also delicious. Loved the artichokes and mushrooms. It was all good. They have a condiment-type stand where you'll find add-ons like parmesan and what not to sprinkle on top of your pie. My small pizza with tax ended up being almost $17. 

There is a full service bar. The bottle wine selection was decent, but the ""by the glass"" selection only had a few options. We tried to order beers at the register with our pizza (we could see them in the cooler behind her), but she said we had to go to the bar. Think there was some confusion there about that. 

Desano is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back.)"

Right down to the chrome all over the outside. Nicely placed with a large parking lot. Very close to the stadium, so expect it to be filled with fans wearing their Black, Blue and Silver on game days. Booths and a few tables inside.

Traditional diner menu with burgers and eggs and things. I did see other people with waffles and wings, but it was actually breakfast time when I was here. I chose to go with the ""Uptown"" which is two eggs and hash browns with a waffle. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were both crunchy and soft. The waffle, however, was beyond desciption. Crispy on the outside, flully inside, it was still nice and hot to melt the butter and it soaked up the hot syrup. Excellent flavor.

Service was great. My waitress refilled my coffee often and cleared plates as I emptied them.

Free wifi, though no power outlets that I could see.),(Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night, hangover cure- Midnight Diner covers it all. 

The menu is huge. This is one of those places where if you can't find something you like here, well the problem is probably you. Their fried chicken is delicious (heads up: it does take a little longer, worth the wait). Marinated overnight, hand breaded- get it over a Belgium waffle or French Toast. Shrimp and grits (their most popular dish) is also really good. Burgers, BLT (huge), wings- you can't really go wrong with anything. 

The place is not huge, so there's often a wait during peak times. They do have a full bar with beer (including local selections) and liquor. Music is always really great. I found myself dancing in my booth today while chowing down on a grilled cheese and green beans.

They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Warning: if you go here late night, just be careful. There have been a few incidents of crime, violence outside of the diner.),(Just take a half-step inside the shiny, chrome doors and see how Midnight Diner came to rest on Carson\/Tryon. Uhhh....not so much hammer-and-nail here, but how about a nice trip down the highway on the back of a semi-truck? Sure. Rad. Pretty rad indeed. 

Churning out pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, omelets, and burnt coffee like they're going out of style, Midnight Diner is a haven for late-night carbloaders from all corners of Crown Town. If you're showing up for a 5-star meal, you might want check yourself at the door. It's a diner through and through. Low ceiling, cushy booths, counter seating, jukebox, old waiters, waitresses, line cooks. Like a Norman Rockwell. Just great. 

You'll most likely walk out smelling like a mixture of vegetable oil and bad coffee, but sometimes pancakes are the only thing that will satiate an all-night rage before you hit the sack. 

I'm especially fond of the hashbrowns that come ""smothered, scattered, and chunked."" Cheese, onions, and ham. Also, biscuits and gravy in this joint are spot on. 

Glad that Midnight Diner is around and keeping Charlotte's nightlife well-fed with good ol' ""brinner.),(Never had my son say it was the best burger he's had. And we eat out a lot. My chicken and waffles were awesome and so was the banana pudding. The vanilla wafers didn't taste like they were from the box but tasted like mini cakes.),(Let's just say I waited a few months to let Midnight Diner work out the supposed kinks I've been reading about, because I had a pretty tasty dining experience here! If I could give half stars, Midnight would earn a 3.5 overall. 

The place: 24\/7 diner that's quite snazzy looking. It's a really modern take on a vintage diner, if that makes any sense at all. 

The scene: 8:30 am breakfast with a buddy on a chilly Thursday morning

The staff: Really, really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Lisa, our server, was really laid back and offered some great menu suggestions - even noting that certain items were best for a hangover. That's important knowledge, folks. 

The food: I went with a veggie egg white omelet, side of wheat toast and they let me sub fruit for grits. My buddy and I also shared a side of turkey sausage, too. My omelet was of average size (not behemoth) and stuffed with veggies and melty cheese...just what I was looking for. The toast was, er, toast! The fruit was fine but I'm not sure how fresh it really was...almost tasted like it had been refrigerated for some time. No worries though. The turkey sausage patties were flavorful and a nice accompaniment to my eggies. 

The price: A touch more expensive than I expected, but then again each order comes with quite a bit of food. I believe my omelet was in the $7-$8 range but it comes with a side of grits or hashbrowns and toast. Carby carby! I will note that the turkey sausage was $2 for two small patties...a wee bit pricey but tasty nonetheless. 

So, overall the food was good - a solid choice for a low key meal. I'm sure I'll be back to Midnight Diner as it's really, really close to my house and one of the few spots open all hours of the week. However, I do enjoy another local diner quite a bit more due to the freshness and overall vibe of that place.),(I've had bad experiences and good experiences here but what else could be expected of a place that has such high volume. This restaurant is very popular for a good reason. It has an awesome location and is open 24 hours plus has an extensive menu and booze!

I FINALLY got a chance to stop by Harvest Moon Grille and sample some of their delectable lunchy foods. If you're unaware, HMG usually parks it (literally) somewhere around the Trade\/Tryon vicinity and doles out great, quick food all made from local ingredients. They offer two  different dishes each weekday and one very fresh side item. They even have a map on their cart with push pins and little flags showing where your food came from. I love that!

They typically serve two different lunch options with a side for $7-$9 each. If you're thirsty they offer a few different beverages - a flavored water (fresca), bottled water or local soda. All delicious as well. When I walked over to the big orange cart (and stood in line) they were: Chicken Carnitas with a slaw of cucumber, squash + zucchini dressed with their own tatziki, sprinkled with Ashe County cheddar & Late Summer Griddle Cakes - okra, onion and basmati rice bound with egg whites and fried in a delicious patty. Topped with pear chutney. The side for either choice was chilled bulgar salad with cucumber and tomato.

I went with the Summer Griddle Cakes....mmmmmm. They were fresh and flavorful - especially with the pear chutney (which was served on the side). The bulgar salad was a great, light accompaniment...perfect for summer. For two meals and two drinks it totaled $18.50 - a bit steep, but hubs and I are fine paying a little extra for all local ingredients. If you're super, duper hungry this may not be enough to satiate you (just keep that in mind). The order takers are super nice and friendly - they are genuinely happy that you are lovin' on their food. 

I adored Harvest Moon Grill and I'm excited to go back and try another meal pronto.),(Food carts, though becoming big hits in some major cities are limited to the Queen city for several reasons....permitting being one of them and brick and mortar competitive issues that may be having an impact on them.

There are a few in the center city, but mainly hot dog or BBQ and those are more ""stand"" like than ""Food Truck-esk"".

Harvest Moon Grille is a breath of fresh air in food that is good, local, creative and reasonably priced and a nice option for food on the go.

Now it is winter....Sooooooo....the cart doesn't serve lunch during this time of the year, but their Harvest Moon Grille at the Dunhill restaurant is serving great local food (another review I need to do).  Though I think..........though I'm not sure...they do show up on Saturday's at the Charlotte Regional Farmers Market?

These folks are mad crazy about local fare...just a sample of the things they use in their offerings from local farms.....pork: italian sausage, shank, shoulder, jowl, greens..... (peppers, eggplant, specialty condiments)....United Hmong Association of Catawba County - (short-grain rice) ......Bost Grist mill - corn meal .......Lloyd Lewis Farm (cukes, peppers, squash, potatoes) ......Lingerfelt Farm (sweet potatoes, tomatoes) .......Underwood Family Farms (garlic) .......Carlea farm - turnips, eggplant .....Windcrest Organics - salad greens ......Wade Farm - collards .........Pat's Pickin's - mixed greens, turnips, cabbage ......Sunny Creek Farm - squash ......Davis and Son orchard - apples ......Uncle Scott's Root Beer ......and I'm sure I missed something here, but what is interesting about this list.....all the veggies.....no processed food.  

This should be a lesson to folks....we eat WAY too much processed food...way too much salt, fat, and sugar....these folks are a nice change for our overwhelmed taste buds in the world of overpackaged over processed food.
So you want something good...and good for you.....check them out.  I did and I'm a fan.)"

Scanning all the sandwiches, I (as usual) couldn't figure out what I wanted. The guys behind the counter immediately jumped in to help. Really nice. They said their best sellers are the Italian (on the cold side) and the pressed turkey cordon bleu (on the hot side). Score, I already had my eye on the Italian. I got a small with chips and a drink for $8.55. 

The Italian was loaded with meat. The toppings were fresh. Solid little place to get a sandwich. I'll be back to try that TCB.

We decided to get up reasonably early on Saturday and arrived at the market at about 9:00 AM. It was quite busy even this early but we managed to find a decent parking space. And then we started making our way through the sheds. So many choices!

Fresh meats. Fresh eggs. Lots of tomatoes. Green vegetables. Fresh fish. Potatoes. Cilantro. Bread. Jams. Oh, my. I hit the ATM (only a $1.50 surcharge!) and we filled a shopping bag with stuff for dinner. Fresh trout, potatoes and broccoli. Just amazing. And the prices? Quite decent.

The Saturdays: Crowded. fun. local love all around. nice farmers.

Overall, I prefer Atherton Market for intimacy, year round availability and location, but this regional farmer's market is most definitely worth a trip when in season!),(Three stars in comparison to similar grab & go vendors. The turkey and gouda wasn't spectacular (matter of fact, the cheese is waxy, sweaty and downright creepy), but the veggies were a bit more ""in the present"" and the turkey is layered on thick.

Made in the same commissary, therefore, it's the extra snacks that give Farmers Market the edge. Kettle Chips, Late July and Food Should Taste Good, in addition to protein bars, fresh fruit, kale crisps and more give the impression of holisitic eating in the heart of CLT (somehow).

Specials you need to know about:

-Margarita Mondays: Half price, rocks or frozen. Like a little heat? The jalapeno margarita is fantastic.

-Taco Tuesdays: $1 tacos. Get there early. Full house every time.

-Kids eat free on Wednesdays. If you do not enjoy children, probably want to skip this night.

-Sundays: $1 tacos in the bar area only. Nice spot to watch games.

The parking lot here is kind of awkward. Sometimes it's difficult to get in and out when it's busy. Great patio. Very spacious and dog friendly.),(Loco Lime is one of those places that I tend to love infrequently as there are things that sing loud and clear....and some things I could do without. It's a killer location with a lively patio and tons of seating -- optimal for a Sunday lunch or any Tuesday (Taco Tuesday). 

As it goes any given day of the week, I love guac. Guac, guac, guac all the time. Loco Lime's fare is definitely a cut above with the table-side preparation and tender care. Throw a candle in that bowl and I'd eat it like a freaking birthday cake. Good stuff. 

Taco Tuesday -- $1 tacos. Why would you need to know more? 

The only thing that tends to lack a bit is the service -- a bit uneducated as far as the menu goes, spotty at times, and a bit uninterested. No deal-breaker, but can tend to be a bit more than lackluster. 

Still love ya, Loco Lime. $1 tacos, guac, and my own bottle of Tapatio is all I need.),(I say give this place another try - the first time I came to Loco Lime I really wasn't that impressed my tacos were extremely plain and boring but I did enjoy my jalapeno margarita a lot.  However I went back again and think I ordered the right thing this time... some crab queso and a veggie burrito...now I wish they filled my veggie burrito with more veggies but it was a nice combo - rice, portabella mushrooms, plantains, squash etc and get the red sauce it was tasty.

The service was also very good and the hostess let me know before she sat us that they were having dollar tacos if you sat in the bar area as well as $13.00 for mixed buckets of beer. Sunday nights for a cheap dinner this may be the place.),(I'm going to go ahead and echo Tonya & Cathy's reviews...here's what I found at Loco Lime:

1) The menu is pretty standard...you won't see too many risks here. You want Americanized Mexican? They have that here and it's just fine. 
2) The portions aren't as gargantuan as other Mexican restos in Charlotte. And that's fine too - but occasionally I like leftovers!
3) The flavors are a bit bland overall. This goes for the chips, salsa and chicken fajitas. Where's the heat?! 
4) Service was spot on all the way through. Friendly, efficient and helpful for beverages, chips, salsa, orders and splitting up the check. Much appreciated! 
5) The space is great - huge, comfy booths and a spacious patio.
6) The drink menu looked pretty fab, so perhaps if I need to score a margarita this will be a sweet pick. 

Overall, A-OK is a perfect description for Loco Lime.),(The Loco Lime is not very loco or very lime.  It is an amazing space, it has an industrial feel, outdoor seating, chips and salsa and tequila.  What more could you want?  The downside, it kind of had a corporate vibe.  We were told to try the jalapeno margarita, we did.   It was good, but nothing to sing about.  We ordered a chicken sandwich to start, we shared that and didn't want to order anything else.  Meh, I've experienced better, it was fine. I would go back, but not anytime too soon.),(They are moving up with both service and food.

I'm sad for the sushi-loving residents of Charlotte. :(),(*3.5 stars, bumping it to 4 stars for the nice peeps and the quick seating.

Dear Cyros, 
Thanks for being conveniently located to South Park and a low key sushi joint. 

Hubs and I ducked in here one very rainy Thursday and it was SLAMMED. So slammed that the servers, owner and hostess thanked us for our patience. That was indeed a nice touch. That being said, I'm really glad we made a last minute Open Table reserv and were seated right away. The place itself has simple, yet modern decor. Not too many frills and not too many tables either. But that's ok, as long as the food is delicious it doesn't matter much to me!

We ordered a handful of rolls and one appetizer...

Yellowtail Hamachi with Jalapeno: Fresh, thin slices of yellowtail topped with slices of jalapeno and a peppery, citrus-y sauce. The fish was great and I liked the taste of the sauce, but not the consistency. It was a bit grainy.

Nobu Fire roll: Really fresh fish and super duper spicy. Like I was draining my water over and over again spicy. Next time I'm getting the sauce on the side. 

Spicy Tuna roll: Their basic spicy tuna. As others, very fresh.

Firey Tuna Roll: Another spicy one with a generous helping of spicy tuna on top. 

Overall, Cyros is a pleasant sushi stop in Southpark. Will I be a lifer here? Mmm, I don't know...as another South Park sushi joint set the bar pretty high in my opinion.),(Hey Mister, have you got a dime?  OK, so the coolest thing on the table at Cyros is the soy sauce mister, or actually Julia S (victorian nerd) corrected us and said it was atomizer. We atomized our sushi bites, much better, you get the flavor without the sushi falling apart from dunking and I am sure the salt intake for your meal has to be a million times healthier.  The staff is very genuine and our server Meghan was off the charts enthusiastic and knowledgeable. 

I am also a big sake fan, I love to try different sakes.  If you have only had warm sake in the tiny white cups, you are in for a treat with all the fancy smancy sakes around town. Cyros has an extensive sake menu and offers half bottles, they seem expensive, but these are small batches, hand crafted rice wines.  The cloudy, unfiltered, served cold are my favorite and most high end sakes are also glutten free. For all the people who still want a buzz but have food allergies.)"

Yep, the chips are thin and salty and perfect for scooping up their salsa. I liked it, other than it needed more zing to it. Firm and not wet, easily scoopable.

One thing that sets La Paz apart is their Tamales. They are handmade in-house and are delicious. perfectly tender, just a little dry, hint of spice and the presentation is just as it should be. I got the pork Tamales. They come with slivered almonds and raisins and a few veggies mixed in. If you've ever had a sweet fruit like apricots, dates or raisins with pork, you know how much of a marriage it can be. This was nothing less than a welcomed flavor. Savory, salty and sweet with the pairing of a fresh Tamale. Definitely the bread-winner of the establishment. 

The rest of the dish was mediocre at best. Standard ramekin of black beans. ""Roasted"" veggie medley which was in desperate need of flavor. The sides were lackluster and were left untouched. 

My wife had the mushroom and spinach fajitas. Not too bad with all of the mise en place that came with, but there seemed to be a hint of soy in the veggies. I'm not calling shenanigans, but I'm thinking the chef is using soy sauce on their fajitas. Strange....

We at at a sunny, outside table. Service was friendly and attentive.

Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.

The place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NC
The occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversary
The channel of reservation: Open Table
The scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday evening

We made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. 

Our server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.

Beefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4\/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. 

Chilean Sea Bass: 3\/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. 

Goat cheese whipped potatoes: 3\/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. 

Creme brulee: 2\/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. 

Other notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. 

Overall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.),(Delicious steaks and crab cakes. Excellent waitstaff. Surprisingly good beer selection. I also really like the decor. With all of the caricatures... Personally I try to stay away from the steakhouse chains, but the palm is topnotch. If you're a fan of steaks it doesn't really get batter than the palm. A+),(Ok, so my review of the Palm in South Park is LONG overdue, I mean three girlfriend's in the past overdue. I visited in the spring of 2012. The day started with a Bark for Life walk off of Morrison in lovely South Park on a picturesque day with one beautiful blonde date, and culminated with another first date a petite, cute redhead at this location. To get right into it, I have to say, they gave us great service at the Palm. That's something you can't put a price on. I mean really good service. Imagine having butler service for three hours, and the butler is driving a Mercedes, so you know he takes his job seriously.

I met my date among a bustling crowd on a beautiful Saturday night.The waiter went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, and he was very attentive to our needs. I ordered the steak burger, it was very juicy, delicious, and bursting with flavor. It was an excellent portion size. The type of meat, we'll lets just say it was the expensive part of the cow, not rump roast. Unfortunately, I had only six bites of it because I had already eaten a sashimi appetizer at the Village Tavern in the Rotunda building in between dates. My date ordered the filet mignon, and it was delicious, cooked to perfection.

One goes to a place like the Palm for a special occasion, or like me for a blind first date on rare occurrences, but either way, you go for the service and the great food. They treated me like a king, and I will be back for sure. Come see how the other half lives at the Palm. It is sure to be a delight for you and your significant other. I wouldn't recommend the Palm for kids, unless they are very well behaved.)"

They know how to get me. 

The lobster mac (seasonal) is my hands down favorite. They're all delicious- Little Green Muenster, Mushroom & Gruyere. Pig Mac is probably the one they are best known for (pulled pork, mac n cheese, bourbon onions). I love their tomato soup. I always have to order their housemade pickles. Recently, I was lured here by the return of the French Onion. And you're damn right I dipped a soup inspired sandwich into the tomato soup. 

Follow them on social media to see where they are every day and to check out the menu. 

This year, they were on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri. Spoiler alert: he LOVED them. Congrats to Brian and the entire Papi Queso team! So proud of you and all your success. You deserve it.),(The sheer fact that there is a food truck in town, specializing and capitalizing on one of our planet's most universal comfort foods, brings a smile to my face....and heart....and taste buds....and stomach. Had the pleasure of checking these guys out at their launch and whilst getting boozy at Triple C. Brian, owner, and his staff are churning out grilled cheese like mom used to make....and some mom has never even heard of. 

Gotta hand it the menu for these fellas. You can certainly venture for au originale or something a little more on the adventurous end of the culinary spectrum. Can't say there is anything better than a standard grilled cheese, but the varieties with pork, southwestern chicken, leek & mushroom, and the dessert option with nutella are certainly worth shaking a stick at. 

We all know a grilled cheese is best accompanied by soup, chips, or something comparable. Brian has you covered. Rosemary and truffle chips and the tomato soup are available to turn your sammy into a dynamic duo. Pair these jokers with beer from Triple C and you're well on your way to a fine meal fit for the streets of Crown Town.

Prices can seem a little steep at first, but do yourself a favor and talk to Brian or the staff about what kinds of cheese they're utilizing. You'll be happy you did. Also, they have Square, so those of you with no cashola, fear not. 

Catch these guys at a food truck roundup or chillin' at Triple C!),(Today was my third visit to Papi Queso, it's everything I love, a simple menu with limited items, fresh\/real products, great service and Papi makes each sandwich as if it were for himself.  You can tell each sandwich is prepared with care.

I do not think I can drive by Papi Queso without stopping.  Warning Papi, I'm coming to get you!)"

After the ""basket dropper"" was out of the picture, my bank account was a little more flush with spending money and I decided to treat myself to some tea related items I had been eyeing for some time.

I wanted a traditional cast iron tea pot, but sticker shock had me back off.  Instead, I bought a nice glass kettle, some teas, and a new glass much as well as a little contraption to steep my tea.

All in it was over $200, so this place is not for the faint of heart when it comes to good tea and tea products, but every morning now when I get up and do my tea routine I smile because the experience got better.),(If you're a fan of flavorful teas and tea blends and you like the idea of blending different teas, then you'll enjoy teavana.

 They have white, green, oolong, black, herbal, rooibos, mate, even blooming tea. And they have various tea accessories such as tea sets and travel mugs.

 You can sample different teas or even purchase a hot cup of tea if you're on the go. The staff is pretty nice and informative and if you shop there often you'll get mailings and emails for coupons and stuff. 

It can be a bit pricey here, not only for tea, but also for their tea sets, so just a heads up. But the quality is top notch, and you can taste the difference. It really is premium quality. We like to stock up around the holidays when there are specials\/discounts and such.)"

Even an open kitchen so you can watch roll out your pizza dough fresh! There is a cooler out front with a gratuitous amount of pastries. One thing I thought was awesome was the beer cooler. Plenty of single bottles and 6packs! Also, they have to-go lasagna. Take and bake at home. How cool!

Rullo Di Pasta has the potential to be something great and I believe they can get there with a few small tweaks to their pizza and wings. Where I'm a huge fan of any local place that makes their own dough, a feat not easily accomplished, it does come with some difficulties in the kitchen. Also, I'm a firm believer in a well-done pizza crust. 

We went for a half four cheese and half veggies. It smelled amazing, it looked amazing, but the first bite was tell-tale for need of improvement. It lacked that well-done flavor. It wasn't even really cooked fully, in fact. The veggies were still raw, the cheese didn't have time to meld together and the crust was still entirely too doughy. The simple fix? Just leave it in the oven longer! I firmly believe that this would have changed the landscape of the pie tenfold. I'd definitely order this again if it were cooked better. The flavors are there, but just needs a temperature boost.

The wings...sub par. Again, I think these could have been cooked longer as well. They were a little limp and lacked all of the crunchy bits on the exterior. Also, the bleu cheese was pretty weak. Not sure if they make in house or not though. 

All in all, this place has a great story and I look forward to trying them again in the future. I think with those few small tweaks, they can be cranking out great pizzas and wings! Cheers!)"

They finished a major remodel recently and in the process, they managed to jam all the other departments (grocery, electronics, clothing, personal care, jewelry, pharmacy) into the store. And by jam, I mean that the aisles are barely wide enough for two wagons to pass carefully.

Good luck doing a food shop here - in the evening hours, the place is a sardine can. Way too many people trying to figure out where everything is. It's not their fault. It's a little scrambled. Dairy and cheese is in two different fridges (the fridges are actually pretty good - double doors and they can be opened first from either side). It took me three passes down the food aisles to find the small section with coffee. Product and brand selection, even for Wal-Mart, is limited.

As for the rest of the store, it's also mixes. For example, there was a display of pillows in the kitchen area next to the crock pots. I am not kidding you. The ""home"" section was in one area but the ""home office"" was in a different area of the store.

I picked up what I absolutely needed and I got out. If you're looking to save money and buy Wal-Mart, then I suggest you spend the 20 minutes and drive to South Tryon or Charlotte Highway in Fort Mill.)"

The restaurant was mildly busy though plenty of well spaced tables were available. Smaller 4 tops as well as a 6 and a round table, plus a long ""family-style"" table in the center. Lots of good space and windows on three sides of the restaurant - a great location, well designed to be welcoming.

On the weekend, they have a brunch menu until 2:00 PM plus their regular sandwich, burger and salad menu. They also offer an eclectic selection of domestic and imported beers, as well as wine. Today seemed like an Eggs Benedict day, so I ordered that with coffee. I was given a number to display at my table and went off to prepare my coffee. A regular and a decaf urn were available with creamer and the usual selection of sweetener products. There is also a soda fountain with Coke products and urns of sweet and unsweet tea.

The eggs were brought to my table a few minutes later. Fresh, hot and looking delicious. Two perfectly poached eggs and sliced ham on ciabatta with a good amount of hollandaise sauce, sliced melon and chicken sausage patties (bacon is also available). I found it heavenly and a good portion for $8.99.

After finishing my meal, I hung around the restaurant for a while. There is plenty of reading material - newspapers abound and two large screen TV's were tuned in to ESPN and the Food channel. The free wi-fi was easy to connect to and was speedy. Because it was raining, I stayed inside, but they have a dozen tables outside that would be really nice on a sunny day.

This is one of those places where they assemble it in front of you, sort of like a Subway of burrtos. They also offer quesadillas, tacos and salads. The Mexican pizza is something I've not seen at other places.

Otherwise, it's the same as other places. Chicken, beef, pork, etc. Guacamole, salsa, other veggies and the same.

The seating area in this one is interesting. It's more cantina-like with the usual booths and tables, but also a small bar area with a half-dozen seats there. Plus some seats outside.

It's okay, but I prefer the salsa bar that they have at Moe's.

Warning: The chips and salsa\/queso are extra. It's a clever upsell, since they ask if you want salsa or queso and you might not be aware that it's a combo. But the chips I had were good. Nice and crispy with the right amount of salt.)"

They have a restaurant and bar, with a separate bar menu if you want to order smaller plates. The kitchen closes at 10pm so make sure you get there in time!

The burgers here are gigantic and delicious. Like every other restaurant in Charlotte, there is a rule that you cannot cook anything under 144 degrees (medium well), but they are still flavorful and juicy. They serve it with a generous side of onion rings or sweet potato fries.

This restaurant has a bar and restaurant, and the food and drinks are priced reasonably compared to the Westin in downtown. I ordered a small plate $10 worth of scallops which was a mere 2 scallops with a delicious side of pea shoot salad and candied watermelon. I washed it down with North Carolina blueberry port. 

If you're hungry, the highest value small plate are the fish tacos.

If you want variety you can get a 5 course or 7 course meal that starts at $69.

They offer whiskey tastings and have a good variety of top shelf alcohols including a slew of top shelf whiskeys. The bartender is friendly and knowledgeable about everything. 

I would definitely return if I stayed here again.

Just a couple tips about the regular menu:
- Duck was excellent, moist, and tasty.
- Porkchop was very dry and lacked flavor, it needed sauce.
- The Fillet was surprisingly good considering this place isn't a steakhouse.
- They have fried mac n cheese tots. 
- The fries are great!

The waitress at the bar is grouchy and mean. The waiter is much nicer but doesn't know anything about wine.),(I came here for the 7 course tasting menu. The popover was excellent and the staff was wonderful, but the food (for the summer menu) was consistently mediocre, from the amuse bouche through the next four. We ultimately left before it was finished as it wasn't worth sticking through to the end. Maybe their dishes a la carte are better, and I really wanted to like it, but the tasting menu should present some of the best or at least most ambitious samples of the chef's oeuvre, and these fell flat.

For the server and ambiance and the decent-enough dishes, it gets 3 stars, but it was disappointing and I wouldn't go back.)"

It's an interesting little location that kind of juts out of the strip of businesses. True to the bar n' grill scene, Char Bar 7 is a good location in a pinch. 

Ample bar seating in this place. There is a larger dining room, but we decided to have dinner in the lounge. The service was friendly. Nothing above and beyond. Most of the younger servers seemed a little inconvenienced to be there, but hey, it was a Saturday night. Started with the pretzels and they were just right. I like the addition of parmesan to the top and not just razor-sharp salt crystals. The cheese dip was nice and stood out from many others I've had as of late. Not the standard American cheese or beer cheese. This was made from, what tasted like, white cheddar or white American with nice pimiento and pepper chunks. Really dig the flavor these had. I'd order these again. 

I ordered the Leap Year. Burger, bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. Got the bleu cheese slaw on the side. Neither were amazing by any stretch but had a nice touch. If you order a burger without a bun, it is served on a piping hot castiron skillet. Seriously...watch out for that stuff. It was hotter than Hades. I almost scorched my mouth with the first bite. The burger tasted just fine and I ate about half of the slaw. My wife ordered the mushroom risotto on the side of her veg burger. It was nice, but just like other risottos. Creamy, heavy, and a nice filler. 

Major downside is the lacking draught beer. This place would be a 4 in my book if they had some locals on draught being switched out on the regular. I ordered the John Daly cocktail and it was great. Sweet tea vodka, lemonade, and a few other mixers. Nice, but too fruity and a longshot from a beer to work with my burger. 

I will say that the patio is amazing. SO nice for the winter time. They have a cozy lounge with a fireplace and couches, completely enclosed and heated. Take that, cold air! I'd love to come back and just chill on the patio with some pretzels and another John Daly!

3.5 for sure. Cheers!),(So I have waited tables for quite some time and like I said in my note that I left for the waitress, this has to be one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. A server came to greet us, got us drinks and got our appetizer in. Things were fine up to that point. Someone else brought our appetizer out, it was delicious. Then it took forever for us to get drink refills, I had to ask the hostess. We still had to wait for drink refills after this, but ok. Then, after a very long time our food finally came out. It was cold. The server\/bartender never came to ask us how things were, and pretty much tossed the box on the table that I asked for. The tip I gave was generous considering how awful the experience was. I was advised not to go there, I should have listened. Won't ever go back.)"

After two visits, I have a list of tips and suggestions for attendees:

Get the VIP tickets. These get you in at 12:00 instead of the 2:00 ""general admission."" It starts to get very crowded after 2:00 - the waits to get samples are much longer and the free tschotchkies are mostly gone.

At least this year, they were not ""sold out"" of VIP tickets at 12:00. Some folks were buying tickets at the gate.

Bring ID. If nothing else, you must have proof you are over 21. Yes, even if your friends call you ""Gramps"" or ""Pops"" you'll still need to prove it.

You do not have to get there at 11:00 and wait in line. If you arrive at 11:00, you'll get in at 12:00. If you arrive at 11:45, you'll get in at 12:05. If you arrive at 12:00, you'll get in at 12:10. There's no need to wait in line!

Parking, on the other hand, dries up as 12:00 approaches. Consider parking early, then hitting up one of the restaurants nearby for brunch.

Check the weather and bring a poncho. By the time the rain starts, you might not be able to get a 'Yelp' one from the CM! Sunscreen and a hat are also recommended.

If you have a folding chair, bring it and set up in the shade. No one's gonna steal it. After a while, you'll want to sit down.

You will not get arrested inside the event no matter how drunk you get, as long as you are not belligerent. If you are one of *those* drunks then you'll get tossed.

There are a very few samples of food for free. Everything else is not included with admission. Most of those vendors only accept cash. So bring cash.

Either have a designated driver or arrange a taxi or Lyft or Uber.

And most importantly, have fun. Try things you wouldn't ordinarily try. Like the organic strawberry beer? Sure, why not. And also enjoy the tequila, bourbon, scotch, vodka (French vodka??) and tons of beers of all varieties!),(Beer, Bourbon and BBQ. That's one threesome I'm down to be a part of. 

What do you need to know?
-There's not a ton of free BBQ samples, so plan on spending money on food there. 
-You will get drunk. Plan accordingly. Uber, DD, cab, something. 
-To VIP or not to VIP... VIP. Definitely worth it to take advantage of everything before the general admission crowd gets there. 
-You can bring chairs. There's a nice tree and shade area. 
-Drink water in the AM. A lot of it. You're going to be boozing all day. It will be super warm outside.
-Stop by the Yelp tent. Yes, that's a shameless plug for myself. 
-Leave the kids at home.

I have to give StrikeCity an extra star for two reasons: the TV layout and Heather. 

This is my go-to place for football on Sundays. IMO, it has one of the best TV setups in and around the uptown area. On any given Sunday (see what I did there), my group consists of Panthers, Bucs, Bills, Bears, Giants, Lions (on my!) fans. StrikeCity has a TV for all of them... better yet a TV each person can see from our table. Sound for all the Panthers games with a DJ to play music during the commercial breaks.

Bartender Heather is fantastic. She's so sweet and so good at her job. I am even more spoiled because she gets out from behind the bar and takes care of our tables on Sundays. She should wear a cape and be called Super Server.

Bowling: Strike charges for lanes by the hour. The more people in your group... the cheaper it is. You can have up to 8 peeps. The best deal: All You Can Bowl for just $15 all day and all night every Monday

Food: Feel weird about ordering pizza or pasta at a bowling alley? DON'T! It's from Libretto's. Get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I also like the three way chili on the game day menu. Be sure to wear a napkin bib.

Great drink specials throughout the week. Strike also throws a lot of fun events. The private rooms are great for birthdays or corporate parties.),(Attended a graduation celebration for a fine young man. It was our first time in strike city which offers dining coupled with bowling. The food was by my wifes account pretty good except for the beef skewers which folks said could double as bowling pins.  Outside of that the other items on the buffet were good.  We were really more there for sharing in the moment and good times with very close friends who are really our family.   But if you are in the mood to eat and bowl, look no further.),(Oh how I wish this place were more affordable because I would for sure come more often. Listen, my game was taken care of for a bday party and it was a really good time. If I had to pay my own way it would have been a little nuts...it's still bowling, folks. I guess I come from the belief that bowling should be a bit grimy, beer should flow cheaply and freely and the shoes should smell. Basically, it should put the ass in classy.

Anywho, Strike City is indeed a nice, clean bowling alley with a large bar smacked in the center. While the aforementioned bowling and drinks aren't cheap, it is a convenient place to get together with buds to watch a game on their umpteen screens or get together at the Epicentre. Service has been spotty each time I've visited - our server within our private party was friendly and ran around like crazy to make sure we were taken care of. Conversely, the servers at the bar have seemed a little entitled, almost snarky, at times. Listen, dudes and dudettes, I'm sorry I need a minute to look over your drink menu for a moment. I felt like I kept inconveniencing them with my (basic) drink order. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a nice, convenient space but it can get cramped and a bit noisy with douche bags and super drunks from Alive After Five. I will say, though, their pizza comes in from Libretto's - a major positive note there! If you can get your lane paid for, it's definitely a go!),(Great bowling, I wish they had more small balls! Minus 1 star for charging $3.75 for socks.

THE BOWLING:
The lanes are cool and have TVs in front. There are some booth and open bar seating. Additionally, they have a private room for corporate events if you need to reserve for a small party. If you contact them they will set you up with whatever food\/drink needs your party may require.

THE FOOD:
I highly recommend the...
- Pizza (yum, thin crust NY style!!)
- Garlic cheese bread (SO GOOD).
- Chicken wings are ok, and the spinach triangle pastries are really flaky.

Do not recommend:
- Brownies (because they taste worse thee grocery store)
- Roast Beef on bread appetizer. Tasteless on stale bread, ick.
- Champagne\/""Cava"" (it tastes like the $3 Crystalino kind from World Market and costs $6.50 per glass).),(Living in center city one must have a go to place for cheap drink specials...this is it.

On Tuesday nights they have $2 drafts....even Fat Tire!?!?!?  Wow.

I've bowled here with folks from my company and if you are considering doing it, try and get the 2 private lanes on the far right of the place....its like your own priviate room or for a bigger event, reserve the big daddy room in the back with its private 2 lanes, private bar, and pool table.

I haven't tried the food, but the drinks and entertainment are good.  Service at the bar was not as good as I would have liked it to be...they seemed a bit disinterested...was it me or that I was ordering their $2 beers???

Regardless, a great place, good prices and fun to boot.),(I like this new twist on the traditional bowling alley. It has so many elements that appeal to different members of the family. I visited with friend and we waited about 30 minutes for a lane. It's best to do a reservation on a Saturday. The places gets pretty busy. Luckily there was a Yelp check-in offer and I several others were able to get free shoe rental! Yay! We had a waitress attend to us the entire time. Now, if you have someone who doesn't want to bowl, but comes along for moral support. Let them post up at the large bar or bar area. The bowling alley is located in the busy EpicCenter, but there's a parking garage close by. The place is upscale and modern, which is better than bowling alleys I've been to anywhere. I'd go back again.),(Went here for on a weeknight for a work function for some drinks, food, and bowling. 

Some quick notes:

-Great service
-plenty of TVs with sports on
-bowling and arcade games 
-solid drink options and draft beers
-good bar food selection and quality
-great for large groups),(What terrible service. I ordered wings nothing special and 45 minutes later they still haven't gotten here. The group that ordered 15 minutes after me has already gotten there food. Completely ridiculous. I will not be coming back here. Neither should you. Only reason to come would be not to eat or drink but just watch the games. Lowest possible recommendation.)"

I strolled into Polka Dot and ordered four cupcakes, all of which I cut and tasted immediately when I got home. Before I get to the cupcakes themselves, the shop is pretty cute. It's a bit hidden off of the Park Rd. strip - so just be aware that it's inside that upscale strip mall off of Park & Woodlawn. The young lady who took my order was very friendly and offered some great suggestions. I also noticed they sell brownies, cookies and pull apart cupcake cakes. 

When I was tooling around on their website, the pull apart cakes look pretty adorable. Prices are a bit higher than I was expecting, but hey, it's a specialty baked good! $2.50 per cupcake and there are discounts when you order one dozen. All the cupcakes were just so pretty! 

Here's the rundown of my personal cupcake tasting...(keep in mind their flavors change daily!): 

Red Velvet: 4.5\/5 stars: This was my favorite cupcake, mostly because I'm a total sucker for cream cheese frosting. The cake was pretty moist and I loved the flavor combo. My only gripe - too much frosting! I had to scrape a bit off as it was taking over my cupcake. 

Key Lime: 3\/5: My least favorite of the bunch. It just didn't taste very key-limey to me except for a very, very small bit in the frosting. I like the actual cake part, though. 

Pumpkin Turtle: 3.5\/5: Besides the bit of caramel within the frosting, I didn't see where the turtle came in, but I really liked the cake part and the cream cheese frosting. It tasted like a great pumpkin bread with tasty frosting (albeit a bit too much for me). 

Vanilla Bean: 3.5\/5: I adored the actual cake part of this cupcake - it really is quite lovely with the vanilla bean. My ish? The frosting again! This buttercream almost gave me a cavity it was so sweet. I scraped off 80% of the frosting and then happily enjoyed my treat.

Will I be back to Polka Dot? Absolutely! It's an adorable and sweet edition to the SouthPark area.)"

It was CnF's grand opening week.  I immediately posed my food allergy questions to the manager\/owner Hitesh, who went into the kitchen and quickly emerged with the pastry chef, who informed me that their chocolate croissants ($1.75) are corn-free (no baking powder in the batter, and neither corn syrup nor powdered sugar were used in the chocolate ganache filling and frosting).  Out of the individually-sliced French cakes, I could only try the ""chocolate-chocolate"" cake (I swear this is what Hitesh called it), $2.50 plus tax.  Again, no baking powder used in the cake, and only semi-sweet chocolate chips and heavy cream in the ganache filling\/frosting!  How did they taste?  I loved the croissant's ganache filling.  The pastry, however, didn't fare so well.  With the exception of a very few flaky nibbles, most of the bites instantly felt gummy, like I was chewing on leather.  (Have you ever chewed on a moist piece of dried mango?  Yeah, something like that.)  No exquisite bites of buttery flaky crust that descend onto the tongue... I decided to just throw the bread away, but not without eating all the chocolate first!  But, oh, the chocolate-chocolate cake!!  Do yourselves a GRAND favor and buy a slice today!  One of the best chocolate cakes I've had in a long, long time!  (I've had to pass on so many recipes...)  So moist, and so devilishly good!  If I were the pastry chef, I'd give it the unoriginal, but spot-on name of ""Devil's Food"" cake!  The chocolate coin on top, however, was a big letdown.  Almost no flavor at all.  A waste of cocoa, that one.  I just tossed it away.

I had asked if my nephew could sample their chocolate-chip cookie and was handed a shortbread cookie.  My sister, our Mom, and my nephew all gave the cookie the thumb's down.  (I couldn't try it due to a food allergen used.)  I hope this isn't a sign of the quality of their cookies, but no worries.  As long as Cakes N Flakes offer their chocolate-chocolate cake, people will come!

p.s.  I finally received a reply to an email I sent inquiring about location address and website URL.  Looking over their online menu, I'm surprised to find out that Indian food is also being served here, alongside the pastries!  I did not spot any menu listings on the walls that advertised savory foods.  Now my sister and I willl have more reasons (as if we needed more than one reason, the cake!) to come by!)"

As for the shake, she pronounced it ""meh."" Unimpressed with not enough peach in it and the few bits were too small.

That being said, the cajun fries are OK, the hush puppies are unimpressive, and the Cook Out style burger is a typical fast food burger. Its a little better than steak & shake but that isn't a tall order.

See if they can give you a spoon with your milkshake unless you have the soft palate muscle strength to suck a golf ball through a garden hose*. It is very thick.

So when Cafe South eventually opened in the same building with very few changes, we thought we would give it a try.

Yep, nothing structural has changed. The same doors, the same hostess stand, the same tables and the same counters. The menu, on the other hand, has changed quite a lot. It's what I would call ""New York deli"" but with a Southern flavor. A wide variety of plates and meals, ranging from meatloaf to burgers to baked chicken to Thanksgiving turkey dinners. Breakfasts include the usual egg plates, but also a challah French toast and grits and biscuits. Like I said, Southern.

For dinner, I went with the meatloaf and for some reason, the brown gravy. Dumb mistake on my part. Meatloaf should be with a tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was okay. But I feel like I let the side down.

Service was very friendly. Helpful and sincere. Enjoyable, even.

We will absolutely be back again!),(Numerous positive Yelp reviews led us to walk over here from our nearby hotel for dinner. We were seated promptly in a booth and immediately could tell the building previously housed a Bob Evans, with the exact same lay out of tables, booths and counter I've seen many times before.

Hungry from driving all day, we looked over their lengthy southern comfort food menu. Indecisive over so many mouth-watering options, I finally decided on one of my faves, hot open-face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. When our waitress came back and looked at my quickly disappearing meal she said, ""I'm not even going to ask you how your meal is...you should slow down and taste it."" Yeah, it was pretty darn good, just like her sense of humor.

With a convenient location (right off I-77), wonderful food, affordable pricing and great service, I completely concur with all the other positive reviews. If you find yourself in the area and hungry for some tasty southern dining, find Cafe South and enjoy.)"

I booked a reservation for Sunday brunch because I really hate waiting around for a table and when we arrived at 300 East, even though we were early, the hostess brought us right to a table despite others who had arrived ahead of us without a reservation.
The food was excellent. I really enjoyed my crabcake benedict. Lots of crabmeat! The cheese grits were excellent. The coffee was good. My wife really enjoyed her meal as well. and especially her peach fizz.

Bad...
Service was slow. The food took a long while to appear and when it did, it was not very hot. Barely warm. But we *hate* sending food back and so we both dug in rather than complain.

There was a big chip in my water glass on the lip.
$2.75 for a refillable cup of coffee. Really.

The food was great but I can't really say that I would go back.),(I'm not sure what's more cozy here, the charming old house this place is set in or the French Onion soup.

Do you like French Onion? Well, make sure you get it when you come here. I order it every time. It's like a giant hug in a crock. I imagine this is what it would feel like to cuddle with that bear from the Snuggle commercial.

300 East is two levels and has a nice patio. Menu-wise, I've pretty much loved everything I've had here. App-wise you can't go wrong with the Sweet Potato Ravioli or the Baked Marinated Vermont Goat Cheese. And yes it deserves to be mentioned again, the French Onion. My goal is for this review to get French Onion trending on social media. I love the Sopressata pizza. A warning: it is spicy. And delicious. Grilled Gorgonzola-Stuffed Filet Mignon is great. If you order the crab cake, please note that is singular. My friend Ski was disappointed during our latest adventure here last night. Specials are always pretty good. I went with the corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day last night. It came with homemade soda bread, butter and cheese. Holy. It was all absolutely fantastic. 

I have yet to order dessert here in the almost 11 years I've lived in Charlotte. Why? Well, I'm usually stuffed. I do know that Guy Fieri shot Diners, Drive Ins and Dives here last week and he had the Butterscotch Ice Cream Sandwich. If it's good enough for Guy, it's good enough for me. I am definitely getting it my next trip. 

If you enjoy a great cocktail, you have to get the Matilda Wong. It's like a boozy punch type concoction that comes in a small pitcher. It's a must get if you feel like enjoying a drink. 

300 East also does brunch on Sundays. I usually go with French Onion and Matilda Wongs, so don't ask me about the rest of that menu. I'm hoping to have enough will power one Sunday to be a grown up and order the Crabcake Benedict.

Service can be slow at times. I'm not really sure why. However, everyone who works here is super nice. Not sure what to order? Ask them.),(I've been to 300 East now for both dinner and lunch and I can't choose a favorite. The location is splendid and conveniently located off of East Blvd, the old house is outfitted nicely to fit the targeted ambiance, and the food matches everything above. 

Our last visit consisted of a few apps and entrees: 

Baked French Onion - Small crock, croutons, textbook flavor, gratuitous provalone baked on top. Can't find a thing I don't love about it. 

Sweet Potato Ravioli - Nice mix of savory, sweet, and creamy flavors. A little too heavy on the cream sauce, but the rav was al dente and sang on the forefront with holiday-esque spice. 

Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - The dressings alone make this salad crave-worthy. Sesame, soy, ginger, hoisin, of which are perfectly balanced. The tuna was gorgeous and was even better with each bite. 

Much like aforementioned by the infamous Jeff S, the Matilda Wong is not only a right of passage for first-time 300 East-goers, but for booze lovers everywhere. It's 32oz pitcher, quite literally, filled with three different kinds of booze. It tastes like liquid candy and goodness gracious I love it. 

Parking is straight up atrocious. Forget about feeling comfortable leaving your car behind this old house. A half dozen signs screaming ""Your car will be tortured by a towing service if left here."" Not the most comforting parking arrangement. Find a space on the street if you can.

Regardless, this place rules. Pricepoint is fair, food is great, booze is even better.),(1\/2 price wine bottles on Wednesdays HOLLA!  I've always loved 300 East but I haven't been back in a long time.  For good drinks & apps 300 East is a great find.  Their sweet potato raviolis are unbelievable.  The salads are addicting add some crabmeat for some protein:)  I am not that crazy about the entrees that I've tried but it doesn't keep me from coming back.  I can't resist a restaurant in a house after all.),(While I still haven't made it here for brunch (sad panda), I somehow seem to make it here for lunch or dinner every other month or so. The ambiance is still casual and cozy and service is typically on point and friendly. A few items I've snacked on recently that I much appreciate:

The Fall Salad: 4\/5: This is my go-to. Direct from the menu it's: Port Soaked Cherries, Goat Cheese and Toasted Pine Nuts over Mixed Greens with Pancetta Dressing. The dressing doesn't really do it for me but, frankly, there are so many other delicious items nestled in this salad it doesn't seem to matter. The port soaked cherries and goat cheese make a beautiful match. Get it with chicken. 

Sweet Potato Ravioli: 5\/5: If you seek the most delicious, creamy, dreamy, not-good-for-you plate, get the sweet potato ravioli. It's what fat dreams are made of. Hell, it's what my dreams are made of. 

Baked Goat Cheese Appetizer: 4\/5: Um, yum. Tons of baked goat cheese with sun dried tomatoes and plenty 'o garlic. It's worth it. Save the mints for later. 

Fish tacos: 3.5\/4: For a change of pace, I dig the fish tacos. They're fresh and tasty, but nothing that blows me away. They fill the void of a dinner that's a bit of a lighter fare. 

If you're never been to 300 East, I implore you to visit. There are just tons of great tasting items in this sweet little restaurant.),(Best Hanger Steak I've had yet. In Charlotte of all places! So tender and flavorful.

The special of the day, Sturgeon, was really moist and flavorful also. Probably the first time I liked a spicy mango salsa on top of my food. And I was pleasantly surprised at how well they cooked the coconut rice! Next time I would opt to skip the $3 special starter (pasta with mushrooms) only because it was nothing special and the entree was big enough to fill me up.

The salmon was basted with what tasted like a sweet teriyaki glaze. Also good, but tasted very homemade, and I would try other items on the menu before returning to this one.

The brownie is gooey on the inside and topped with ice cream. I also liked the blackberry apricot cobbler which really tasted like peaches and cherries? Maybe I'm hallucinating, but in any case, both desserts were good and plates were licked clean in record time.

Minus one star because....I was not a fan of the complimentary bread, and the hummus was just decent. The main thing that bothered me was the noise level; I blame it on the half off wine special and the plethora of women who filled this place up, but the venue is fairly small and two stories and I had to yell to talk and lean over the table to hear anyone. Extra half star for the server being willing to split the bill to the exact penny!

Tip: Accepts AMEX. Make reservations and sit al fresco!),(300 East is adorable. I love the setting of a cozy house, complete with a large front porch, staircase and balcony overlooking the front of the restaurant. I made a reservation for Saturday on Yelp and we were seated promptly upon our arrival, being lead upstairs to the cute little dining space. At a private-ish table for two, we sat along the wall and were greeted by a very friendly server. I had a (non-alco) Peach Fizz, served to me in a wine glass, while my boyfriend had a red wine. 

We started with the falafel app- super good with great flavors accompanying it. I was torn between the pork, the filet and the crab cake, yet somehow decided on the farro saute- our server suggested I add salmon to it, so I also added a crab cake side- available for $9 to add to any entree! I adore farro and vegetarian entrees so the salmon + crab combo was a perfect addition to this dish.

I really love the ambiance of 300 East- food was solid and the cozy atmosphere was even better. It would be great to come back for brunch or on a sunny day- I hear they put tables out front when it's warm!)"

They serve heaping portions of fried seafood, when it comes out of the kitchen it is consistently too hot to eat.  Isn't that what counts whilst eating fried food?

The theme of Red's must be sweet all over - sweet staff, sweet barbecue and sweet lemonade. While the effort is there, the meal just didn't thrill me overall.

Open face turkey sandwich, tuna melt, all the variations of loaded fries, the big holla (it's like a grilled cheese on steroids), breakfast... I've never had anything bad here. During our latest trip here, my friend Andrea got the cheeseburger wrap. It looked incredible. I will definitely be ordering that during my next visit. 

We also discovered something new on this latest adventure to Mattie's: Chrissy's Buffalo Chicken Dip. Reido talked about this the entire drive to the Diner. When we got there, the rest of us were distracted by a mini cooper outside filled with stuffed animal dogs (I'm confused too... some kind of contest promotion). Not Reido. He went right inside and ordered the dip the minute he sat down. It was delicious. I think the best part of it is the homemade pita points that come with it. I could eat those by themselves.

A long list of shakes, malts and floats. I try to save room for these, but I tend to eat way too much food. These also have a fried oreo sundae. The only thing that can make an oreo even more delicious is to fry it. 

The service is quick and friendly. There's one super sweet server that I swear must be there every single hour of the day. I always see her. Does she ever get a day off?!

Tons of free parking. The place is kind of small inside, but there is also outdoor seating as well.

Love this quaint little spot across from the NC Music Factory with it's superior diner decor, complete with mini juke boxes at every booth. 

They've got all of your favs here. Pancakes, french toast, eggs, hashbrowns, all types of toast, coffee, juice. All the fixins for a great bfast. 

Tried the Padrino omelet. Wow. This mammoth omelet is covered in marinara, stuffed with a gratuitous amount of banana peppers, italian sausage, and mozz. Packs a flavorful punch and each bite only beckoned for another. Loved every last bit. My wife got the spinach and feta omelet which was equally desirable. Those fluffy, fluffy eggs are made with such love on that flattop. 

If you have read Nicole's review, she's absolutely right. Pancakes are unreal. Perfectly crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy\/soft on the inside. Not your average pancake, though. A nice accompaniment of nutmeg  comes along with these breakfast fav. Quite a nice addition and definitely makes you wish for more. They are pretty big pancakes, too. They fill most of the large plate they are served on. Any more than two, and you might as well be going for a record of sorts. 

Prices are super cheap and the food is delectable. Another solid choice for breakfast or late night. Love ya, Mattie's!),(Finally I made it back to Mattie's.  After the amazing yelp event we had here I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into some good greasy diner food once again.

I had heard great things and read all of the shining reviews they had to date. I was pleased to find a very humble dining room, complete with appropriate music. I love me some Indian tunes!

We started out with the standard pappadaam cracker bread. Very brittle and filled with flavorful spices. All three dips\/sauces were choice. Fresh, pungent and never lacking in flavor or interest. 

Next, pakoras. These little fried bundles of joy make something as boring as cauliflower AWESOME. An assortment of lightly fried and seasoned veggies, dusted with cumin. Tender, flavorful and intriguing. Worth every penny. 

Then, garlic cheese naan. If you don't get this, you're missing out. Awesome flavors. A perfect marriage of textures as well. If you have some of the sauces left over from you pappadaam, USE THEM. All work with the naan and rather well, I might add. 

Entrees. My wife had the Palak Paneer. Green and savory sauce. Filled with fresh herbs and chalk full of hefty chunks of fresh, house-made paneer (Indian Cheese). Tofu-ish texture and perfect for topping on your rice or MORE naan. I'd get this dish and I'm not even a vegetarian. 

I had the Lamb Korma. Dude, I love me some lamb. They do this up RIGHT. Tons of flavors swirling around a hilarious amount of steamed rice. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this dish. Other than when it was all gone. *tear*

Service was top notch. Get ready for some contestant visits from your server(s). They'll upsell you a lot, too. Always will ask if you want more of....EVERYTHING. 

Price is very reasonable as well. Me made it out under $50 for the two of us.

JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg,"Restaurants, Italian, Food",Charlotte,1,35.1976211,-80.8522725,Fiamma,264,4.0,"(I'm not much of an Italian food fan boy, but Fiamma is definitely one of the more understated powerhouse restaurants when it comes to the well-executed Italian fare in Charlotte. Made it in on a weeknight for a semi-late dinner and had a fantastic time. 

We skipped the drinks this time around, but they had a rather extensive wine menu. The focaccia and pesto they start you with is phenomenal. I'm a huge proponent of good focaccia and Fiamma's recipe is perfect. I barely have words for how good that pesto was. Fresh, aromatic, and strong. The smaller breadsticks in the bread basket were a nice touch as well. 

Entrees were stellar. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the veal chop, which was the special for the evening. Side of gnocchi and a killer red wine reduction. The veal chop was tender and packed with flavor. Stuffed with spinach and onions and each bite was better than the last. While hugely different than what my typical order would be, I was very pleased. The gnocchi....man. So good. Subtle, chewy, sweet with the tomato sauce and fresh herbs, and a perfect combo with the chop. I'd order that as a side dish again in a heartbeat. 

What really set this place apart from other eateries was the service. Our server was one of the most professional I've had in a long time. He knew the menu like a second language and offered great input. Also, being served some comp limon cello at the end of a meal is always a nice touch! Great flavor and super strong. 

They also had live music while we were there. The guy had some serious talent and really set the mood. Really looking forward to heading back in for a special occasion or date night.),(I was a bit hesitant to write a review on Fiamma....mostly because my first (and only as of now) experience was during Charlotte Restaurant Week (CRW). But, alas, I believe CRW is a huge opportunity for restaurants to shine. And in a sink or swim kind of world, Fiamma floated. 

First off, hubs and I had a bit of an ordeal with our reservation. As soon as the dates of CRW were announced, I called Fiamma one early January afternoon and made a reservation. Moments later I realized the guy on the phone never took down the time. Hubs called back a few days later and confirmed the date and time - which were never written down in the first place. 

Because of the inconsistencies we called a few hours before our reservation to confirm the exact time (as we never received a confirmation phone call, etc) and we're pretty much told - yeah, come on in around 7 or 7:30. Um, ok. 

Nevertheless, we walked into a very busy restaurant and sat immediately at a table next to the door. Chilly in January, I say! It's important to note that the CRW menu had a plethora of choices for each course...lovin' the variety. Here's a breakdown of the meal and service:

Bread basket & oil: 5\/5: I have to mention the bread & olive oil mixture because they were slammin'. Freshly baked in house and different varieties.

Delizia Contadina: 3\/5: Mixed greens with pears, spicy walnuts and Tuscan pecorino cheese sticks. This lightly dressed salad was nice and refreshing but the dressing was a little tart for my taste. Regardless, it was a nice size and a decent start.

Ravioli of the Day: 2\/5: The CRW feature was fresh lobster and shrimp ravioli in spicy tomato sauce. I took major issue with this dish. It was so, so bland - I didn't taste any spice whatsoever. And the filling within the ravioli was pretty inconsistent - it varied from a delicious lobster mix to a fishy shrimp mix. I appreciate they make the pasta in house, but this dish let me down.

Tortino Al Ciccolato: 4\/5: You can always get me with chocolate. While I expected more of a baked torte, this little nugget came out as a mini lava cake. The flavors were nice and rich. I would have liked a bit more ice cream, though! 

Service: 3\/5: It started off really well - our server was attentive, helpful and efficient. But as soon as we had our salad course, it really fell off. Now, I'm sure he was super busy considering CRW and the full restaurant we were dining in. However, we waited at least 35-40 minutes between our salad course and our main dish...and we only saw our server once in that time increment. You may think I'm being nitpicky, but when you shell out a bunch of cash (yes, well over the $30 per person), you hope for nice service. 

Fiamma was a fine meal, but not the great meal I was hoping for. I will absolutely give them another try when they aren't overworked during CRW. Hoping my next visit will leave me more enchanted than the last.)"

I order a glass of Prosseco and I tell the server if it isn't fresh, I will take the Sauvignon Blanc.  Simple.  She serves me flat prosseco and tells me it's a new bottle.  Really?  And then she got pissy because I didn't drink it and asked her to take it off the check.    I will post the photo of my sparkling it looks like still wine in a Champagne flute.  It's kind of funny now.  

On a lighter note, I ordered a burger and fries and the fries came out piping hot.  That settled me down for a moment.

The chicken fajita burrito was served on a very hot plate with a large amount of rice and no refried beans. Freshly made, it had a lot of flavor and good consistency. The rice was cooked properly - I've been to other restaurants where it was dry and crunchy. Not here.

There were a few large screen TV's set up and tuned in to the sports channels.

The waiter was attentive, but not too much so. We were left to enjoy our meals in peace. Separate checks were offered without our having to ask.

As Mexican restaurants go, this was good. I've had better. And I've had a lot worse. Three stars today.),(Sometimes, I drive here for takeout chips 'n salsa then walk next door and grab soup from the Chinese place. Does that make me a fattie? Oh well.

A-OK nails this place. It's not bad... it's not the absolute best. 

When you sit down, there is a big empty bowl in the middle of your table. This is something I like to call guacamole entrapment. You may not have wanted to order it before, but you will now. 1900 will make it right there in front of you.

I pretty much order something different every time. What's my current food mood? Tacos? Fajitas? Something I can't pronounce that is covered in cheese? (yeah, that was my most recent order on Sunday). No complaints about any of it.

Although I have moved away from the Montford area, I relocated to a 'hood where there is another location. So don't consider this a break up 1900... just an it's complicated.)"

Now, Threes has set up shop and has the welcoming arms of a good spot for lunch, glass of wine, draught beer, or sushi. 

Made it in for lunch and was absolutely ravenous. In search of adequate vegetarian  sustenance, it was nice to find so many easily modifiable menu options. Ended up ordering the Banh Mi and substituting the pork for portabello mushrooms. The baguette it came on was a little softer than usual, but had a great chew. Tons o f veggies and a creamy sauce. I was so hungry, I could have probably eaten double the given size. I'd definitely order it again. My wife ordered the veggie sandwich on ciabatta. This was the winner. Tons of veg and a nicely balanced pesto. Nice touch with the fresh mozz, too. We also ordered a side salad to split. Spinach base with tons of veggies as well. The white balsamic dressing was light and perky. 

The aspects of Threes that really shine forth are the wine options and draught beers. Tons of local brews ranging from NoDa, Birdsong, Triple C, OMB, and others. Though I'm not much of a wine drinker, the space lends itself well to lounging about with a glass or splitting a bottle amongst friends. Love that the wine racks are out in the dining area. It has a feel like you are in someone's den rather than a restaurant. 

Also, just as a sidenote, and the fact that I'm a bit of a notable bathroom seeker, Threes has Dyson Air Blade hand dryers in the restrooms. Now, if you've never experienced one of these bad boys, you're in for a treat. The most efficient way to dry your hands and one of life's simple joys. Each time I visit the restroom here, I always smile knowing I get to use it. Odd? No. Smart hand drying? Oh, yes. 

Also, I've heard they have sushi here in the evenings and I'm looking forward to coming back to try it out.),(This is where Press wine and food use to be I never went to press but I'm assuming it's the same place with just a new name.

Also, there isn't a really easy place to walk up to the entrance if you park around back near the construction side of the building.

And your $6 bag of tiramisu caramels, how I wish they were free.

I like to visit you before I head into a movie,
And smuggle in a chai latte, that's super duper groovy. 

You are a chain but I don't mind too much,
Because you continuously offer me a filling, tasty lunch. 

Yes you're expensive but I love your free snacks, 
I sometimes pretend it's a buffet and initiate my attack. 

I know I'll be back to partake in some eats,
And probably leave with a bag full of treats.),(You can always depend on D&D (dungeons & dragons) for good coffee and sandwiches.  I know it is a million dollars, but it's good quality, so you let it slide.  They are offering omelets now, they have a little omelet station, a few toppings for $6., I couldn't believe my eyes.  I also had a great cup of coffee today too.  When we were leaving, they put out grill cheeses wrapped in paper to serve with a cup of soup.  What a great idea!  They also had some jars of soup for $11, just to remind you that you are at D&D!),(Another date night and another couple of glasses of wine at this great little place.

I actually thought they were closed as it was just before 9. We started with a bottle of Parcel 141. I ordered the Chilean Seabass. Very light and flaky with a mild buttery taste. The server was on top of us for the whole meal. Aces to this place, as well as the eclectic mellow atmosphere. Very relaxing. We took a bourbon pecan pie and key lime to go as we had already eaten more than enough. Or was that drinking I was thinking of? Great place. Would love to go back!),(Gourmet delicious goods. Excellent quality. A bit pricey with certain things, but you get what you pay for. 

I'm here a lot. I used to come here every morning for coffee. I have since changed my routine and moved over to whole foods because the delicious pastries and breakfasts at Dean and Deluca are just too tempting. But that's a credit to the quality of Dean and Deluca. 

I don't really do grocery shopping at dean and deluca. I come here for the espresso drinks, pastries, omelets, gourmet sandwiches and soups, sometimes the sushi, and the desserts. I'm in and out a lot depending on my craving. 

The staff is super friendly and Dean and Deluca underwent a major renovation since first moving here. The end result was amazing. 

It's also a fun shopping experience here, wandering around and looking at all of the great options that you don't see everyday in other grocery stores.

It may try and pose as an Irish pub, but this place is just a good ole neighborhood bar. 

This is going to sound odd, but this is a great spot for taco Tuesday. They do $1 street tacos (chicken, veggie, beef, and fish) for dine in only. No they're not authentic or fancy, but they're just some cheap and yummy tacos. The day of the week I end up here the most is Mondays. I am a huge fan of their all you can eat crab leg night. It's $29.99 and comes with a salad (basically lettuce in a bowl) and hush puppies. They do get pretty busy on crab leg night, so get there sooner rather than later. It's a pretty solid start the week when you can get down on some crab while enjoying a nice night on the patio.

Wednesday is trivia and 1\/2 price burgers. They have TVs on the patio. If you come here on Sundays for football, just be aware that they are a Cleveland Browns bar. I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms if you are not a fan. What's the saying? Misery loves company? Poor Cleveland sports fans. 

The parking lot is kind of small. I'm not sure of the current rules with neighboring parking lots. Currently, the old Philosopher's Stone is empty, so I've been parking there. I would just be sure to ask the hostess or manager on duty when you get there to make sure you're parked in a safe place.),(So impressed with what they have done to this place...stoped in late with some out of town guests on a Sunday night the place was dead but to be expected on a Sunday and after a big holiday.  Either way we really had a good time the bartender Michelle was very friendly and welcoming.  Can't wait to come back and try the food.),(It's not my favorite Restaurant for Irish Cuisine but it's still very good and the bar scene can not be beat.

We were in the area today and stopped shortly after 11:00 for an early lunch. Being early, we pretty much had our choice of seating. Most of the seating is Bar Seating on stools but there are a couple of regular booths over on the side. We choose a booth.

My wife almost had a fit when we walked in because she is from Pittsburgh and this is a Browns Bar. I reminded her that Killington's in Huntersville is also a Browns Bar and she relented and went in and in the end, had a great time.

Our server was very good and we did not want for anything. She took our drink orders quickly and gave us enough time to make up our mind on a very extensive menu.

She ordered the 7th Street Steak Sandwich with Mac-n-Cheese as her side. I had Shepard's Pie with Tater Tots as my side.

She enjoyed her Sandwich and proclaimed it to be one of the best she had had. My Shepard Pie was good although I am a traditionalist and prefer lamb. Plenty of beef however and a good savory taste with ample portions.

Another couple who came in later and sat on the porch had a yellow lab puppy with them and being animal lovers, it was a nice touch  and added to what was already a nice  atmosphere.

We have to go back down in a couple of weeks and this will definitely be on the table as a dining option.),(I love the area in Elizabeth right across from Philiosopher's Stone.  The food was pretty great and I love outdoor seating where I can people watch from up high.  Trivia night was the best I have done since Wild Wing and the staff were friendly and sweet.

As a former New Yorker myself, I know a good bagel. While the interesting flavors they offer at Panera and those other chains are... interesting... the stuff they have here at Poppy's is the real deal. Everything, Sesame, Pumpernickel, all the classic flavored bagels and they're all large and fresh and fluffy with the great chewy and crunchy bagel texture that they are supposed to have.

Tip: spend an extra buck and get the salmon spread on your toasted bagel.

It's probably not the sort of place where you sit around all day, like a Starbucks or Panera, but it's nice for a quiet coffee (good coffee, by the way!) and a friendly meet with your buddies. In the nicer weather, sit outside in the sun. No wifi.),(I freaking love bagels. Basically, anything made out of bread, or within in the family of bread, typically makes its way into my heart....and stomach. I greatly appreciate a good bagel with cream cheese and pretty much at any point in the day. 

Poppy's totally delivers. A quaint shop off of Sharon Amity\/Providence with a a ton of options. A semi-shotgun set up with ample seating and plenty of natural light. A great place for breakfast with a buddy or the whole family. Also, there are 4 coolers filled with beverages. OJ, other juices, sodas, milk and tons of other choices. I'm a big morning beverage person so this is much appreciated. 

There is also a ton of other items the main cooler. Deli items galore and plenty of salads of all types and chopped items good for a picnic or potluck. 

Now, the bagels. Phenomenally large bagels with a nice chew and plenty of space for schmearing butter or cream cheese. The honey wheat and blueberry variety were choice and both are worth their weight. Many other flavors to choose from and I can't wait to check the rest of them out. Love that they slice the bagels all the weight length wise and only half of the way for the width. Super helpful when you're driving and need to tear off a honkin' piece!

The staff is super friendly and they move quick. Love it and can't wait to head back in for breakfast!),(Yay I'm a fan - this was one of the best bagels I have come by in the Queen City - well maybe in the south in general.  Definitely New York style bagels.  It looked like all the cream cheeses were made in house and you can make your own omelet to top on any bagel you want.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I would love to come back for lunch and give them a try - all boar's head meats and made from scratch soups.),(Mmmm carbo-licious. 

I met the lovely Ms. Tonya P for a brief bagel this morning and 'twas delicious. Carby, crunchity toasted bagels (mmm sesame) and fab cream cheese. The schmear has to be homemade right? Because I dabbled in the chive and the vegetable - both were equally tasty. 

Inside Poppy's has a smattering of tables and a cute little patio outside where Riley (my pup) enjoyed some bagel bits off of the concrete. Tasty. Be aware that the patio can be quite noisy with the umpteen cars passing down Providence and Sharon Amity, but no worries, I had my bagel and great company. 

Next time I'm in the area, I'm definitely going to pop in and pay homage to Poppy's by indulging in a nice toasty bagel and a pound of cream cheese. Nice to know that there's another local bagel joint in CLT!),(Wandering around Harris Teeter Morrocroft (Taj)  this morning, decided to pick up some smoked salmon with all the fixins'.  Did not want to drive to Poppy's for a bagel, so I decided to just break down and buy a couple from Harris Teeter. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Bright light shining, angels singing.  POPPY'S bagels are in the bin at Harris Teeter!!),(New York-like atmosphere. A lot of energy and the efficiency is excellent. It was crowded when we went, which was 12:30 on a Sunday. This is a positive sign. I always worry when a restaurant has few-to-no customers at peak times. 

As far as the bagels, one was soft and the others were more on the well done side. The toasted bagel was very good, and my wife really enjoyed the everything with vegetable cream cheese. On the other hand, we live in Huntersville and usually go to Bagel Bin. While Poppy's Bagels are good, we like Bagel Bin bagels more. We didn't try any sandwiches, soups, or salads at Poppy's Bagels, so keep that in mind. And a big positive for Poppy's Bagels is that their prices are better than Bagel Bin.

Overall, Poppy's Bagels is recommended. Since it's a long drive for us, we wouldn't go back unless in the area. But if you live nearby and like bagels, then you should probably check it out.)"

Orrman's is a cut-to-order cheese shop sourcing seasonal selections from small dairies. What does that mean? We're talking cheesemakers making the cheeses by hand. If you're hosting a party and want to impress your guests, come here and have them make you a custom cheese board. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Rachel and her staff are all so helpful and friendly.

Along with being a cheese shop, they also offer a small menu for lunch and dinner. Small, but well done. You can't really go wrong with any of the grilled cheese options. All of the sandwiches are created from the products on their shelves and cheeses in the case. 
Personally, I always get the farro salad. I think it is so delicious. I usually get a soup as well. They are made from scratch and they source the vegetables from local farms.

We have a cheesemonger in 7th Street Public Market now. That's right! Owner, Rachel, is knowledgeable cheese master hailing from the Chelsea Market in Manhattan. What a nice breath of fresh air this addition is to the market!

I was stoked to the shop being built out and ever more enthralled to see it up and running earlier this week! Stopped by to check out the quaint walk-up shop and we talked through some of her cheeses. She was just getting ready to slice into an aged Wisconsin Gouda and my eyes got wide. She sliced off a small piece and handed me a sample. Sold. I ended up scoring a decent sized wedge to bring home. Also, I got my hands on some delicious almonds near the register. A perfect addition to any cheese plate you'd like to concoct. 

For those who appreciate fine cheeses, this should become your go-to in Uptown. Curated and sophisticated, but not out of reach for the cheese-craving commoners. Worth every second just to see all of those rounded and wrapped wheels of cheese!

On the flip-side, there are also tons of other items at the shop as well. Local jams, peanut butter, goods from Polka Dot Bake Shop, and other small items.

It's the usual menu with burritos and bowls and salads, plus the usual chicken and beef and carnitas and vegetarian options.

For Chipotle, it's nothing super special. For the food court, it's a great option. I'm a fan!),(Chipotle in the SouthPark mall? Uh...yes, please. 

Very nice to see Chipotle's stainless steel surfaces from across the food court. Definitely the black sheep amongst the menagerie of lunch\/dinner choices. It's the only place in the food court with it's own seating INSIDE! Not very common to see this in a food court. 

All of the regulars found here. Chipotle's common fare and pricing. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just straight up amazing flavors. 

The flow of customers is a little odd, so beware. You kind of have to jam into the place to get in line as it starts always on the left and winds out of the door into the walk way. May be a bit of hustle and bustle while waiting for your burrito fix. 

The only grievance I can report is the staff. Not your typical Chipotle staff. Had qualms with requests and didn't really understand the concept of guac going on a burrito bowl....Also, the woman at the register had a little bit of ""back talk"" with one person in my group. Maybe just an off day for this crew. 

Still speedy and churning out customers left and right. 

Understandably still new and working out the kinks. Not a frequent mall rat, but if I'm ever at the apple store or picking up something from Urban, I'll be grabbing a burrito. 

Thank you, Chipotle. The SouthPark Mall just landed a spot on my mental\/culinary map.)"

Great lunch buffet and good service.  Good naan and freshly-prepared dosas, although, as Mimi B. mentioned, the crepes aren't as crispy and golden as I've enjoyed at other restaurants .  Chai is good, but the desserts are even better!  Loved the carrot halwa.

I always feel like I'm eating a little bit healthier when I am here. Perhaps it is their commitment to reducing waste and recycling or their hormone free cheeses and meats.

As to their selection, yes it does seem a bit more limited than other ""build-it-in-front-of-you"" places which have different types of burritos and more salsas and toppings and nachos and that one where they shout at you as you enter that has a salsa bar.

Great staff. The girl who put the toppings on my burrito was super happy and really excited. I know that some of her enthusiasm rubbed off on me and improved what was already a good mood.

This is a small location with very few tables inside. If you're here during a busier time, expect to get friendly with someone as you share the table.),(Parking is awful. Just get ready for that. However, don't let it deter you from a great burrito. 

Lots of pretty sunlight in this location. Kind of OG in my book for Crown Town's Chipotle stops. Love it. Eat it frequently. Plus, I always enjoy the burps. 

In fact, I think I'll go right now.),(I kid you not, this Chipotle has some of the nicest staff around. So happy go lucky making burritos, taco salads and the like. 

Every time I roll into this Chipotle I'm impressed with the super clean facilities, exceptionally nice folks behind and counter and, let's be real, their burritos have yet to let me down. Massivo barbacoa burrito bowl, pinto beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, lettuce medium salsa, if you're askin'. Super fresh and, frankly, Chipotle does a nice job of sourcing sustainable ingredients from their suppliers. Check their website if you don't believe me. 

My only gripe is that they charge $1.75 for guacamole (on your burrito or as a side). That's pretty steep, amigo...especially because I love me some guacamole. But besides that little hiccup, this Chipotle makes me happy with solid burritos and fantastic, friendly service.),(This place is a good solid burrito place.  With a nice selection, but not too complicated, I can order and get my eat AND drink on (as they serve beer too).  

Much better than individual places that claim to be SO good (i.e. Phat or Johnny Burrito) Staff is fast and you are in and out in no time.  Add in a nice little patio area to watch traffic go flying by *grin* this is a nice little place to add a few inches to your waist line *wink*.),(I used to come to this location a lot (until they opened one up in South Park mall). I like the service here. The staff is super friendly and while it does get busy, I haven't had any issues there. 

It does get busy and the parking here in horrendous. 

But outside of that, what's not to like. Excellent burritos and burrito bowls, fresh ingredients, fresh guac, fresh chips, great salsas. The prices are also pretty reasonable too. 

Chipotle is solid and it's consistent. It never disappoints.)"

I used to drive past this place all the time. I had no clue there were even businesses operating in this rundown shopping center. So I braved the parking lot, knocked the alignment out of my car probably 10 times. And it was all worth it.

For the newbies, here are some important things to know:
-You can't see Le's from the parking lot. You have to get out of your car and go inside the mall. Go past the Dollar Store at the second Asian Mall entrance. Walk through the hallway. It is on the right.
-Cash only
-They close at 6
-Seriously, the parking lot looks like a serious of bombs went off in it. Be careful driving through it.

As for the food, I knew right off the bat that I wanted the #6 grilled pork banh mi. With the prices so cheap and the fact that I survived the parking lot, I knew I wanted to order another one for later. While staring at the menu trying to decide, the super nice man behind the counter suggested the #8 BBQ pork. Oh man, delicious. The bread, the pickled veggies, the meat... both sandwiches were just fantastic. The #8 wins for me.

Two giant sandwiches... just eight bucks. You can't beat that.

Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this small slice of Vietnamese sandwich heaven. Can't wait to go back and try the sugar cane juice!),(Equal parts adventure, experience, culinary safari, near scrapes with overtly life-threatening conditions for any vehicle, and personality. Goodness gracious. I've loved Banh Mi for years, but Le's has sparked a fire-y passion in my little Vietnamese cuisine-loving heart. 

Made it in on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed, and we were amongst tons of regulars. It was a great. My being green around the gills was easy to spot all the way from the cratered parking lot. 

Follow instructions on every other review you'll read here. Asian Corner, walk down the (awesomely dirty and strongly loved) hallway, hang a right, and get ready for a sandwich worth it's weight in gold. 

Now, there are tons of options. I wanted to swing for a grand slam of ""Wow! I've never even heard of that!"" but decided not to vie with au originale. #6 on a long baguette, please. It was....so good it rendered me speechless and with a face full of fantastically balanced Banh Mi. The bread.....my dear, sweet....it was perfect. So crunchycrispy, soft interior, slight chew. What kind of delicious sorcery made this bread?!?! Just absolutely perfect. The veggie combo -- standard pickle-y carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The pork. I've been missing out on this the entire time I've lived in Charlotte until now. One bite and you'll be a believer. (I've been told to call an audible and add paté to the #6. Next time: Done.) Oh, and much like the aforementioned, suckers are like $3 a pop. 

I'm a believer. Addict. Cheerleader. Wondrously and deliriously complete now that I've experienced Le's. If you're reading this, Owner\/Management\/Sandwich Artist, please accept my humble Thank You for all that you do.),(I'm so glad I finally went to Le's Sandwich Shop. While it's definitely not in the nicest area of town and the area looks pretty sketch-tastic, the sandwiches are absolutely worth the trip. 

I don't want to completely echo what all the other reviewers are saying but here's the low down:

-Incredibly friendly owner
-The sandwiches are $3 each and are damn delicious. 
-The baguettes are super fresh provide the perfect amount of toasty crisp 
-The #6 is delightful. Grilled pork, pickled veg, spicy jalapeno, bunches of cilantro, special sauce. Get one. Get two. Get three to go. 

It is the best bahn mi sammie I've had in a very long time. Even though Le's isn't much to look at, the sandwiches are unearthly good. If this place was closer to home, I'd probably set up a cot and live there.),(Every time I drive around Sugar Creek and Tryon, I think it is time to try Le's Sandwiches and I never stop.  Today I was craving Middle Eastern food, as much as I wanted tabouli, I decided today was the day for bahn mi from Le's. Yes, today is the day!

It is everything a foodie, eatee, adventure eater, tourist, you name it, it fills the void.  Off the beaten path- check, inexpensive -check, fresh ingredients 
-check, friendly service- check, in a shopping center that feels like it's abandoned - check.  A little sketchy, where you see all walks of life- check. 
A funnel cake vendor in the parking lot-check.  A group of car detailers in the parking lot- check.  A huge Asian market to stock the pantry -items that are a million dollars at Harris Teeter- check. 

Props to a simple menu, fresh ingedients, made with love and reasonably priced.  Le is the man.),(The location is rough but SO WORTH IT. With multiple closed stores and a pothole riddled parking lot, you'll think you're in the wrong place. Walk inside the large, Asian market storefront and turn right at the empty fountain. You're sure to find a line out the door waiting for Le's famous sandwiches! Cash only.

Crispy, savory, and delicious! Great fresh bread, insanely awesome marinated meat, vinegary crunchy carrots and onions, spicy sriracha. A perfect combination! I ordered the #6 which is pork but they also offer other meats. $4.25 what a deal! I tummy was happily full all day. I would like to try the other sandwiches but honestly the pork is just so incredible I can't stop thinking about getting another.),(Get  the  #6.  Best banh mi in Charlotte.)"
Y7lpoA_lJ1rx3NNqHMgGwA,"Burgers, Asian Fusion, Restaurants",Charlotte,0,35.1716684,-80.84926390000003,Nom Nom Burger,107,4.0,"(Burger night, we headed to Nom Nom in the shopping center on the south east side of Park and Woodlawn. Downstairs, I think this used to be a Mama Fu's?

Sunday night, the service was a little show. I think the waitress specifically didn't take our order because the kitchen was running behind. She was really the only waitress staffing the dozen and a half tables, plus two management types (owners?) were bringing completed food from the kitchen and bussing tables.

When we did get our order in, I chose Olde Mecklenburg Brewery's Captain Jack (a local brewery) and the Nom Nom Burger. Rather than the standard fries, I upgraded to the Sriracha Fries. Our burgers arrived not too much later. Cooked as ordered, it was medium rare with a nice pink center. Lots of meat here, topped with melted provolone, mushrooms and onions. Excellent. The fries were good, tossed with Sriracha sauce for a really nice bite.

The waitress was really trying, but the service was slow despite her efforts. Maybe it was busier on a Sunday than they expected. YMMV.

I've had better, I've had a lot worse. I would probably return. Four stars.),(One part burger... one part Asian. Put them together.... Delicious. Yes, that's with a capital D.

I walked in to grab lunch this afternoon. The door hadn't even closed yet before a friendly worker walked up, greeted me and informed me the host would be with me in just one second. Then another smiling employee. Everyone here is beyond nice. Love that. All restaurants should strive to have a staff like this.

I wasn't sure what to get. The host took the time to walk through the menu with me. I finally landed on the sliders. I wanted a chance to try three different burgers. The Nom Nom was hands down the winner for me. The special teriyaki sauce... the shittake mushrooms. So good. The Pad Thai was also great. The Banh Mi was my least favorite of the trio, but it's hard to compete with the other two. 

Alright, here's all you need to know when ordering a side item: GET THE SHRIMP CHIPS. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Just order them. They are just fantastic. I dipped mine in the sauce that comes with the Banh Mi. Each chip sizzled like pop rocks candy with each dip. Don't mind me... I'm just a big kid playing with her food.

The wipe off board has Ramen listed as a Winter special. You can pick the broth and protein. I cannot wait to go back and try that. I also want to try the Not So Lonely burger. Several people have told me it's one of their favorite turkey burgers in the city.

Local craft beers on tap. Convenient location. Will be a great place to eat lunch outside when it warms up this Spring. Solid place to grab lunch or dinner. I will definitely be back... probably sooner rather than later!),(Well, well. Look what's made it's way off of Woodlawn. Not just your average burger joint, but one with a twist. Made it in for a late lunch on opening week and, from a food perspective, have to say this place has some serious potential. Stopped in to dine solo, which I never do, just to sample the menu. I'm glad I did. 

It's a simple interior. Nothing special, some kitschy decor, ample seating...nothing too daring. 

Seated, drink in hand, menu in hand, and food ordered. Went with the Ahi Tuna Burger. Dude. I've never seen anything like this sucker. Bun made from sticky rice wrapped in a rice paper. Talk about innovative. It held up well through over bite. Great blackened Ahi tuned, sprouts, avocado, and a killer ponzu sauce for dipping\/pouring over the monstrosity. The flavors were magic. Though, the rice ""bun"" did end up being super filling. Served with ""shrimp chips."" I've had these before and love them. If you've never seen them\/had them, think pork rinds, but sans the porky flavor. Dip em into the ponzu and listen to them crackle! So gnarly. 

Biggest downside is by far the ""wait to be seated"" and ""wait to be served"" atmosphere. Think they'll be better off with ordering at the counter, seating done by the guest, and then having numbers on the table. The service just seemed a little disjointed.

The pricepoint is a little steep. $14 for my burger. There are a few items that are closer to the $10 range. 

This place has some serious potential. My interest has been seriously piqued. Will I be back? Big time. Next time, it's beef all the way.),(Burgerlicious! I was so excited to check out Nom Nom Burger it has been bookmarked as a must try for awhile now.  Thanks to Ben G. for setting up a CMYE and helping me get out here to try this place once and for all.   The verdict amazing!  

This isn't your typical burger joint a lot of people were comparing it to Cowfish in Southpark but without the sushi.  Think of it as burger fusion  - burger meets Pad Thai for instance.  The Pad Thai burger was just one of the combos we got to enjoy some other notable favorites the Nom Nom burger (this was #1 for me), Kalbi burger (Korean ohh yea), and the Banh Mi sandwhich (a tasty chicken sandwich with pork pate - say what!) This place is unique and definitely stands out against the other burger places in town.  

So stop by on Park rd and check Nom Nom out - bring the kids too it's a great place to take the family.  Great outdoor seating is available I recommend enjoying some Asian beers on the patio like the 33 a Vietnamese beer which is a great choice for the summer months.  Don't be shy to ask your server what to order they know the menu well and can make a suggestion for you. 

*If you're not in the mood for a burger the shrimp tempura was some of the best I've had in town and you can not go wrong with an order of garlic fries!),(Ordered the Kalbi burger this time and it was simply the best burger I've ever had; no joke...maybe I'm partial to the kimchee and fried egg, and those are big components but the meat itself and the way it's marinated is simply an unbeatable combo in my judgment. Awesome!!!),(Been here twice! Once during the weekend of the Wells Fargo golf tourney and once after finals ended. Gotta say that I'm definitely a fan. 

I would describe it as an Asian Fusion burger joint to those that are curious. If you like Banh Mi sandwiches (Vietnamese sandwich for those that aren't familiar) or Korean BBQ (Kalbi burger), for instance, Nom Nom has their take on them in burger form. They also have the more traditional, classic burger options, and appetizers too. There's a good selection on the menu and you can get either fries or shrimp chips with your burger.

I tried the Kalbi burger my first visit and the Banh Mi on my second trip. The Kalbi burger rocked. It was super delicious. The Banh Mi was pretty good, although I personally prefer authentic banh mi to their version. But it was still tasty. The fries are super thin and also very tasty. The shrimp chips are a nice change of pace too if you're feeling something more like a chip. 

Service was cool. It's not cheap to eat there, but not outrageous. If you're expecting fast food prices, think again. The prices are on par with cowfish burgers or even something like Cheesecake Factory. Personally I think it's worth it, but to me pricing is more about expectations. If you go in thinking you're going to spend $7 or $8 for a burger and you pay $11 or $12, you might be surprised . I had glanced at the menu previously so I wasn't surprised. 

 I'm curious to see how their more traditional burgers are. My friends who went with me ordered the more traditional burgers and they looked pretty good. Some day I will see for myself. 

But I'll definitely come back again. I really enjoyed my previous visits.)"

There's one on almost every corner - it's crazy!  But HT in Ballantyne came in handy  - we made several trips to this location during out five day visit.  Here's what we purchased:

-Produce: It's plentiful and beautiful... not a bad apple in the bunch we brought home, and sweet strawberries, fresh asparagus, ripe mango, lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, and more...

-Dairy: feta cheese and milk 

-Protein: Hebrew National Salami and a huge pack of skinless, boneless, chicken breasts 

-Herbs and Spices: nutmeg, ginger, garlic, and more... 

-Frozen fun stuff: pie crusts and ice cream - we found the flavors and brands we were looking for

-Packaged goods: cereal, pancake mix, tortilla chips, canned tomato, pepperoncini peppers, and I'm sure a handful of other things I'm forgetting at the moment.

First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.

Our waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).

We had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel ""bones"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.

Having read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a ""lunch"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The ""fire roasted corn"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.

We didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.

Would I go back? No, I don't think so.),(sadly, my only southern bbq experience was here, only out of convenience since it was within walking distance to our hotel. the local coworkers weren't fans of it either. the food wasn't THAT bad, but the service was horrid by one of our two servers. we were a group of about 12, and the female waitress was in her own little world. example, she forgot about our cornbread, saying she wasn't sure if we were ordering it since we had ordered fried kettle chips. really? when our senior VP asked for Kendall Chardonnay, she repeats it as Ketel One? Really?!?! 5 people ordered wine, and the first 3 got it in wine glasses. the other 2 got it in irish coffee mugs as they ran out of wine glasses, i think the 3 were the only ones in the restaurant. oh when our Senior VP asked about his glass of wine, she told him they were still making it. making wine? really? sorry, but she got on my dang nerves as she was forgetting everything, and never asking if we needed anything. our other server, jared was great and prompt. however, he said he made my mojito, and it was the sweetest mojito i ever had. as sweet as the sweet tea. no bueno. i didnt taste any alcohol.

the fried kettle chips were good, but the only sauce that was good was the bleu cheese. i got the sweet tea, as i wanted to try everything southern, and the first was uber sweet. second one was not sweet at all! so odd. not consistent. the corn bread skillet, was very cake-y, not enjoyable. 

i ordered the 3 item platter, as i wanted a taste of everything. had the sausage (Was told it would be spicy, yay!), pulled pork, and the beef brisket. i chose the fancier side of macaroni and cheese (a must for me) and their coleslaw. the mac and cheese, although we killed it, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. the coleslaw was just ok. the pulled pork was good, but it tasted like something i have had in CA. dissapointed. the brisket was bleh. the sausage was disgusting, and not spicy at all. oh i think the best thing was the texas toast like bread that came with the dish. sad. 

lastly, their bathroom REEKS of URINE. i thought it was just me, but my other coworkers had the same reaction without me telling them beforehand. it's a large restroom (about 6 stalls), and it seriously smells like someone peed all over the ground. the employees must use this restroom, are they immune to it and have not noticed? yuck.

Everyone tells you to skip the salad bar at these Brazilian Steakhouses, but it's impossible. Everything up there is just so delicious. It's not like the salad bar at the bbq place. I mean, there's great food up there. I think you could do just fine with that and skip the meatfest. Whoa! What am I thinking!

Twenty different kinds of meats on skewers make the rounds of the dining room. Prime rib, sirloin, pork loin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb chops, even platters of fresh baked salmon and swordfish. I felt bad for the kid with the Brazilian sausages and the chicken. I mean, sure we'll give it a try, but that's not why we're here. Tip on the lamb chops. They're ten times better with some of the mint jelly. Yes, mint jelly. Trust me on this.

It's a touch on the spendy side. $50 each for the dinner, plus drinks and tip. But you can get a discount coupon online from their website at the moment. Note that there is an 18% tip included with the bill already. At least the line on the check says ""extra tip"", so now you're warned.

Dress is not casual, but they still seemed to let people in with jeans and tshirts. Yes, I'm talking to you in the bright yellow ""Super Mario Brothers"" tee. Seriously, dude. This isn't Bubba's BBQ Barn. Show a little class.),(First of all, their wine list is bonkers.  There were items on the wine list that retail in the grocery store for $15, selling for $50 - $60.

So it is $40 dollars a person to dine at Chima.  The waiters come by with meat on skewers.  Everything, steak, steak, steak and more steak and lamb, chicken, pork, salmon, did I mention steak?  There is a salad bar, with all kinds of lettuces.  Wedges, endive, romaine. dressings.  Black beans and rice.  Pre made salads.  Most plentiful, you cannot go away from this place hungry.

Am I proud that I'm a meat eater.....yes and no.  I love animals.....the pigs...not so much.....cows are a bit too big to hug....chickens are cute ..not very loving though.....lambs........hey...need I say more!

But for all their cuteness alive, I adore them more dead and cooked........no more so than at Chima where they have perfected the delivery of cooked meat like no bodies business.

As usual, it was drinks up at the bar upstairs....great little place for a drink before dinner, though I wish this place was a bit more hopping for just locals in downtown...nice space and vibe, but with the little traffic it sees outside of diners, it reminds me more of a hotel bar than a hopping down town bar.

Finally onto dinner, we were seated right next to the buffet, which I'd recommend not to do as the traffic can bleed a bit out from there right by your table.

Wine was selected, the waiter was pleasant, though the secondary servers were less animated and seemed a  bit green in the server arena.

We ate the meat and drank the wine and all was good. I am bumping them up a star as the delivery is very consistent.  Is it excellent.......no, but it is definitely good.),(This review is by no means a testimonial to the quality and diverse offerings of the food.  The preliminary appetizers that come with a traditional Brazilian Steakhouse that are carb induced to make you full much quicker were dry.  The protein offers were good except for the pace.  Several times during the course of dinner 4 or 5 straight meat bearers would show up at the same time.  I understand it was a week night and not as busy as usual, but they had to see they were stumbling on top of each other.  I understand the old ""don't let the meat get cold"", but how about pace your meal.  This was a bit overbearing at times.

The cut off age for children is 12.  My nephew is 13.  All he ate was 3 small pieces of Filet Mignon.  They charged him $50.00 for his meal.  I mean that is all he ate.  No bread, no lettuce, no cold cuts.  Just three pieces of meat.  It seems it would have made ""common sense"" to charge him the child price.

There was a gratuity added for only a party of five.  This was no clearly documented and traditionally, it is parties of six or more.

The floating servers, were hovering at times, clearing plates and asking questions.  Everything seemed rushed and they didn't offer us enough space to enjoy the company we were with.

For a business meal perhaps this makes sense, since you can expense the rather high cost.  For a nice casual family or friends experience, I would not recommend this steakhouse.),(Right away let me tell you this place was all-around excellent!

They have a complimentary valet (of course you should tip) which I would
not have known unless I called first.  Either way if you get in earlier there is free parking on the same street.

It is right downtown and the atmosphere is just alive and beautiful!

When we called we asked if there was a dress code and I was told casual was fine.  When we walked in there were folks from casual to business but everyone blended fine.
BTW we stopped by the other ""brazaz"" and it was in the bad part of town.

I am Brazilian and in the Army.  We're new to SC and decided to drive up there this weekend for some churrasco.  I've had churrasco in other places like this one.  Although this wasn't the best one I've been to it's definately good.

The SERVICE was excellent! Our main waiter was very pleasant and checked on us constantly refilling our beverages while the gauchos replenished the cheese-breads along with other assortments.

I am fluent in portuguese and I listened as the MANAGER constantly communicated with her staff w\/ her earpiece letting them know which tables or sections needed immediate attention! She was all over it.  She even came by herself and asked how everything was and if there was anything she could get us.

The COLDBAR was decent.   It was a lot better than the churrascaria in San Antonio, TX.  There was a wide variety of entrees to include two varieties of rice & beans.  They also had ""farofa"" on the side and fresh mozzerela and other cheeses.  Try the CHICKEN-SALAD it's a well known brazilian dish.

When we started w\/ meat he brought some freshly fried bananas, fried yuca (yummy) and other appetizers.   

The MEAT was delicious and once we flipped our card to orange it just didn't stop coming!! The Lambchops just melted in my mouth.  Try the PICANHA and the ALCATRA meats they are two of the best brazilian cuts!!! The Filet Mignon was also very good & hearty!  My wife had some of the salmon glazed w\/ passion fruit and she said its the best FISH she's had in a while.

One tip* before you come here skip lunch and don't eat until you get here.  Don't fill up on the cheesebreads and salad-bar because the heart of the meal is the meat!! 

Depending on your income you can consider it pricy.  For two people my bill with tip came to about $113  (it included some brazilian beer)

Someone wrote a bad review on here and I ALMOST didn't go.  But after driving to Brazas I said lets go see the other one...being right downtown....I am so glad I stopped in and so will you.  We went on a Saturday night and of course everything is better on Fri-Sat.  

It is different from traditional american steakhouses.  So if you've never been let the waiter\/waitress explain to you how things work.  Learn how you're supposed to eat at a churrascaria...Follow my tip about not filling up on appetizers.  Afterall you're here for STEAK! You can get a bunch of meat on your plate, flip the card to black, and eat, the repeat :-) until your belt-button pops (like mine).  

Brazillians eat everything with rice and beans, put some farofa on top of it with a little hot-sauce (found in cold-bar) and eat that with your meat! That's the brazilian way.)"

This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I've never actually bought seafood from here. My affection and obsession are solely based on the amazing lunch menus they crank out every day.

There are some constant items, but the lunch menu changes daily. They post it every day around 10:30am on their website, Facebook, and Twitter. So, make sure to follow them. Lunch is served Monday-Saturday 11am-2pm, Dinner is Tuesday-Saturday 5-8pm. 

I've never had a bad meal here. Sandwiches, fish tacos- it's all damn delicious. My absolute favorite is when they do lobster rolls as the special. They are perfection. Warning: if you see it's lobster roll day, go early to make sure you get one before they're all gone. Also, if you go late and they're sold out, don't bitch about it. That's a you problem, not a Deep Sea problem. Seriously, when they post it's lobster roll day, I derail my entire schedule to make sure I can swing by for one. 

Seafood counter-wise, the prices seem pretty fare. Remember: you get what you pay for in life. Good, fresh seafood is worth it. You'll always see the same duo working the counter and tables during lunch. They know all the regulars, all the regulars know them. They are great and will put a smile on your face. It's not a huge place. There are a few tables, but your best bet may be to get your food to go during peak lunch time.)"

While the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.

A few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front (""Best in the Queen City"") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.

Service was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.

Really good chicken and great service. Yum!),(When you walk into La'Wan's there is a poster of a martini glass with a chicken leg in it. Now this makes me chuckle.  Our server was so friendly and always a step ahead of us.  He's the kind that if you have a restaurant you want to steal him away.  

The food does not rock my soul, but it is served hot and plentiful.  And it's really nice  when we were leaving they all said good bye.  Very refreshing to have such a pleasant experience.  We get used to mediocre service and forget about what it's like to have proper hospitality.

The menu is standard meat and two veggies, pintos, lima, collards, mac & cheese, potato salad, mashed potatoes.  Roll or cornbread.  Sweet tea. Ten dollar check average.),(3.5

This place was pretty good. I was craving for some southern fried chicken and this place definitely fit that bill. The chicken was delicious and the skin was fried perfectly. The only thing was that the food took awhile to come out.

Seems like a lot of people get take out. I wasn't too thrilled that the workers didn't ask me if I wanted a refill on my drink and I had to go up and get it myself. It probably took 30 mins to get the food. Kind of crazy if you think about it since all I got was fried chicken. But based off of the fried chicken and just that I am definitely a fan. 

This place puts Roscoes to shame. We in Los Angeles are so deprived of good soul food.)"

There isn't a huge selection of books here, but that's okay. I saw quite a few interesting titles and sadly, did not have an opportunity to purchase today. Only because I spent three hours sitting at a table, nursing a terrific Americano and talking with my friend.

I'll be back here for sure!),(I've always loved coming to this little shop. Not my first though as a coffee shop since it's not in my direct line of travel, but it's always a treat when I can make it in. 

They pour Counter Culture Coffee here and make a great lineup of affordable beverages. You'll be hard pressed to to not find something you like here. Also, they have some killer lunch options for those who work through their lunch break....like me.

The book store portion of the shop is just incredible. You can smell the old books upon entering. They recently extended the book section to make it larger, which is a huge plus. They constantly hold book sales here, and you can always find something of worth or of note. 

My favorite part: The upstairs lounge. SUCH a great spot to work from, have a meeting, eat lunch, or just hangout. Great overlook of the book section and tends to be a little quieter. 

Love Julia's. Always a treat when I can make it over to this shop.),(I am beating myself up for driving the extra 2 miles to Starbucks and passing Julia's by all these years.  I guess the giant parking lot for Habitat Re-store was a little intimidating to me.

 There were a few things that I really enjoyed about Julia's the staff was  extremely friendly,  my latte was strong just the way I like it, and they use pasta noodles as stirrers how clever!  I would say the prices are similar to Starbucks but who doesn't want to support a local business I will come to Julia's a lot more often now. 

 I look forward to my next visit and browsing all those used books.),(There's a Habitat ReStore store. And then there's Julia's Coffee. And they are attached! That's super.

Really, my adventure to Julia's started out in Cotswold as I was searching for a close place with good coffee and free WiFi. Thanks to my handing Yelp app, Julia's came up first just a few miles away with free WiFi! Hooray!

Inside, Julia's is adorable - it's super clean and full of affordable used books (sales benefit Habitat for Humanity), cute little tables and board games. And, clearly they have beverages and a few snack-aroos for sale. I camped out at Julia's for a few hours and tried two different beverages. The first was their decaf iced mint green tea. The friendly barista behind the counter suggested it as a nice refreshing drink for the blazing hot afternoon. It was tasty and indeed refreshing. A small came out to $2.02 including tax. 

As for my second beverage, I have to agree with Deanna H. that their Chai Latte is incredible! It is insanely flavorful, spicy and offered the perfect amount of foam. My Chai Latte was in the $3 range - much cheaper (and more delicious) than Starbucks, if I may say so. 

This is a great spot to grab a tasty beverage, hang out or purchase gently used books - all supporting great, local cause.),(So I see Julia (not the person this place is named after, but rather the Yelper) check in here all the time.  I saw there was an art opening for an oil painter last week, so I decided to kill to birds with one stone....see the place Julie always goes to and check out some art.

It is a cute little place with food, coffee, and art.  Folks are really nice and they even have a little upstairs seating area.

Books are there and for sale and very well organized. All of this of course benefits Habitat for Humanity...a very worthy cause.

The coffee was good as was the art and some place you should patronize and give the big corporate coffee stores a break.)"

The friendly employee will call out to have your choice of protein created while he\/she fixes up your salad. The interior is low key and slick, albeit smaller than the other location. Regardless, the food comes out super quickly and, of course, freshly! 

I favor the Cobb salad as well as the Asian Shrimp salad. The Cobb is full of flavor and that dressing is to die for. While the Asian Shrimp salad is stuffed with plenty of fresh baby spinach, tasty grilled shrimp, Chinese noodles and such, the soy ginger dressing is pretty weak. 

Also, if you see brownies near the register...grab one! They are fan-freakin'-tastic.),(Large Salads -Good but not Outstanding.

Today was that day. Raining Cats and Dogs during out drive down from Cornelius and it looks like we were their first customers.

I had the Build your own salad and I started with mixed Greens, Flank Steak, tomatoes cumcumbers, feta cheese, onions and black olives with a balsamic dressing. Watched them make it and it was an impressive thing to watch.

My wife ordered the Salmon Salad which is a standard menu item and brought here own dressing.

My salad was good and the portion size was hugh.

My wife liked the Salmon but not a fan of the rest of the salad. Said the bed of greens had too many course stems which to her made the salad rather course.

Staff is friendly and the dining area is neat and clean. Restrooms could use a bit of work however in terms of emptying the trashcans.

All it all, it was pretty good and while I would not make a special trip from Cornelius, I would give it another shot if I were already in the area.)"

I'm not sure how that happened. My mouth just ordered delicious things and I just ate them.

It's a neat little spot, lots of bashed up wood and it's kind of dark. A neat spot for an afternoon of day drinking, perhaps. Or just a cool hangout here in NoDa if you're looking to try something other than a brewery.

Yep, they make drinks here and there's a draft list of about a dozen or so local beers.

Cool spot.),(Beers. Lots and lots of beers. 

This is one of my favorite spots in NoDa. I used to live a block for here, so I pretty much lived here as well. Almost didn't move because I didn't want to be so far away from this place.

What to get: all of it. Menu is great. I love the beer brat and juniper berry kraut. I also have a love affair with oysters. Here you can get farm to fork North Carolina varieties as well as daily Atlantic varieties. Or... get an oyster shooter. Sometimes you need vodka with your oyster. Reuben is tremendous. Wings are pretty yummy. I haven't really been disappointed in anything I've ordered.

Ton of great draft choices that change often. Go here in the fall for a pumpkin beer. They do a cinnamon sugar rum. Hello lover. They also have fun shot selections like root beer float. Different specials every day.

Seating is kind of limited here. There are bar stools, a giant table in the middle of the place and a handful of booths along the wall. Parking can also be tricky in NoDa on the weekends. I recommend parking on Yadkin. Just be sure not to park in front of a driveway. You will get a ticket.),(Can't believe it has taken me this long to review Growlers. Though NoDa has added several new watering holes, Growlers is by far my favorite. From the free organic popcorn, beer cheese and array of beers, it's definitely now a NoDa staple.

Came in with some friends on a Tuesday night and grabbed a booth. All of which are fashionably adorned with vintage, wooden doors. Started off with the chips and beer cheese. Pure, bar-friendly heaven. How you could say no to this glorious treat escapes me. So good. Followed by Growlers' incredible popcorn, I was a happy camper. I don't know what it is about their popcorn, but goodness gracious it's amazing. 

I ordered the beer brat with juniper kraut. Can't say I was in love with it. Pretty salty, bun was really soggy and the kraut was just....kraut with juniper berries. Not a bad combo, just needs some tweaking. My wife tried the pimiento grilled cheese. Not too shabby. A little on the weak side and piled with pimientos and scallions. I'm a fan of subtle pimiento flavor, but it was still sufficient. 

The bar also houses a ""beer engine"" that has been refurbished from 1936. One of the coolest aspects of the establishment, in my opinion. Makes me want to slick my hair back, wear a bowler hat, and wear suspenders. Another fun fact is that Jeff, one of the owners, is a Cicerone. A certified beer guru. One of the few in NC. Pretty much he knows everything there is to know about beer(s). This place: legit.

Best humdinger of a win? $1 PBRs. My hipster counterparts would rejoice with me and joyfully raise their glasses. Cheers for cheap beer, says I. Even if it is hipster champagne. I'm a happy camper at Growlers!),(I don't know what it is about this place but man oh man do I have a good time.  Give me a pumpkin beer in a cinnamon sugar rimmed pint glass SOLD!.  This is definitly my new favorite Friday\/Saturday Night  hang out the people are cool the bartenders rock and the atmosphere is just plain cozy.

I'll be checking think place out more often and will be back to review the food :)),(Cask beer, you say? Indeed I'll have a pint! While I'm no ale aficionado, I was really excited to hear about this sweet new pourhouse (with cask beers and 1930s growlers) in NoDa. Naturally, hubs and I dropped in for a quick pint and bite to check out Growlers. 

I love love love the feel of Growlers, with the exposed brick on one side, cask ales, laid back approach and teeny space, it's definitely a place you want to keep coming back to. Service was friendly and knowledgeable and the bartender helped me choose my ale of the day - the Orange Blossom Pilsner. 

As previously mentioned, I'm not a big beer drinker but I really enjoyed my pint. I dug the orange essence and the smooth finish. As for the food, I only tried the beer cheese dip - which had great flavor, I just wish it was a bit thicker. Being that I went to school in Madison, WI I'm pretty picky about my cheese...especially beer cheese!

Overall, I'm really excited to come back to Growlers. It's a great neighborhood bar with a super cool concept and interesting menu. Looking forward to my next trip...word on the street is that the bread pudding is amazing!),(house made dogs, brats, mustard

Overall, would not return.

Here's a run down of the food I tried:

Complimentary Bread: Delicious. Unfortunately, it went downhill from here.

Hummus: Did not like the hummus because it tasted weird and was really dry. Plus, the pita seemed kinda stale. Would not get it again.

Tuna Sampler: Sounded like a great idea, but it was really not fresh at all. American restaurants need to not attempt to make sushi.

Beet Salad: It was kind of missing ... beets. 

Lobster Mac n Cheese: Yum. Lobster and Mac n Cheese should always be paired together, but I wish there was more lobster. 

Sides: Spinach was SO SALTY oh god. The mushrooms and the orzo were not bad. Nothing to get excited over.

Burger: I actually thought the burger was one of the better entrees. My only feedback on the burger is that I wish they had a different bun and that the beef was dried out and too well done.

Trout: HUGE. Not bad, but I'm not a trout person. Trout is kind of a really mushy fish.

Halibut: Well cooked but the flavors were kind of boring. The halibut was served over a bed of orzo. Maybe my flavor sensors got numbed from the salty spinach, but I thought this was boring.

Roasted Chicken: There was more salt than chicken in this one. To make matters worse, it was really tough and dry.

Chocolate Cake: Tastes like its from the grocery store. So dry and the icing wasn't even fully defrosted or something it was all just crumbling apart. The best part was the vanilla ice cream. 

Cupcakes: We got the platter of 3 which includes red velvet, chocolate, and pumpkin spice. The chocolate was by far better than the chocolate cake but nothing too exciting. I felt like they were really generic.

Oh.My.Goodness. It was tasty and creamy and down right heavenly. The kid's cup is 4 ounces - which was plenty for me, especially with the toppings I chose. Custard is definitely different than standard ice cream and it was such a treat to take a trip back to my 'sconnie days.

I've been here several times for group dinners. Most recently, on Saturday night for a birthday. The space is pretty small, so it does fill up quite quickly.

Pretty sure I've had almost every roll on the menu. Everything is great. I get something different each time. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I always get sushi when I come here, but the menu also has noodles, fried rice, wok, hibachi, specialty, etc type dishes.

We go through a lot of hot house saki every trip here. I think the staff gets a big kick out of watching our group.

It can be a little pricey to eat here. My friend and I had drinks (maybe a saki added in there too.. can't remember now), two rolls, few pieces of nigiri, miso soups... with gratuity added it was about $80.

If you work\/live\/stay uptown, this is a great place to walk to for a sushi fix. Parking may be a little challenging if you have to drive. On the weekends, there is a valet. Week nights... parking on the street (if you can find it) is free after 6pm. A lot of the garages around there though are just $5.),(Room 112 is one of very, very few places that serve sushi in the Uptown area (other than Fujo and KO Sushi).  During lunch, it can get super crowded and even if you're taking your food out, you will likely still have to wait a good 10-20 minutes to get your order.  I would recommend calling ahead during lunch.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and prefer this place to be a quick lunch pick up spot.

They have lunch specials which consist of 2 rolls and a salad for around $9.  The rolls are consistently decent and I always order the spicy rolls which unfortunately come with that ""crunch"", which is more like fried tempura (and extra fatness), acting as a filler for more fish.  I'm really not a fan of the crunch rolls at all, but it's decent.  The salad here is very mediocre at best - a bunch of iceberg lettuce (which has like zero nutritional value) and what tastes like thousand island dressing - yikes.  I normally skip the salad part and head straight for the goods.

For dinner, I'd rather go to O-Ku.

In all fairness, Room 112 isn't a bad spot for a quick bite and definitely a decent option lunch, but given the wait, quality, and value, I prefer KO sushi a little more for lunch - that's if we're doing a comparison of all the sushi places in Uptown.  Rolls are decent, but nothing to call home about.),(Still my go to sushi spot downtown after enso dropped the ball.

For this little occassion, my apartment building was having a social event and Saki bombs and sushi was on the menu.  Never had a saki bomb until then..........not bad........should keep that on my drinking list for the future.

The funniest thing about this entire visit was the manager\/owner...was doing saki bomb every round.  She'd set them up and do it.  Tiny little thing she was and got a little stinky, which I thought was VERY cool!

Sushi was good.....saki bomb was better........still my neighborhood Sushi place!),(So had just wrapped up a gig in Charlotte and as part of my year tenure in Charlotte, I had tried many places for food including Room 112. It was conveniently located next to the office building I had to work out of and it was a place where I knew I could grab food quickly as the service is quick. On top of this, it is probably one of the very few sushi joints in the uptown area so it adds a check mark for convenience. The joint itself is fairly small with only a small sushi bar spot with 5 stools and then tables to serve around 30ish people total within the restaurant itself.

The servers here are all nice and I am grateful that they would always remember my drink order. I would always get the tuna tartare with avocado and then an eclectic mix of sashimi. During my many times here, I have had the tuna, salmon, mackerel, uni (when available), and the list goes on. The appetizer is simple and comes drizzled with a tasty sauce. It is standard fare and a nice starting dish. For all the sashimi, I think the quality is OK. Some days it is better and other days it does taste a ""bit fishy"" with that after frozen feel to it. The ratio of fish to rice is solid which is appreciated but I think the biggest hurdle is that their inventory of sashimi is hit or miss depending on the week you go. There have been many times where they have not had a few of the cuts of fish that I wanted which  I understand as I am sure sashimi is not a ""big thing"" in Charlotte given  the demographics. The rolls (although I have not had any) look good and lots of people seem to order that vs what I was ordering.

All in all, Room 112 was an OK spot that is certainly convenient. Definitely worth checking  out for the lunch time as there seem to be many specials making it a good deal for professionals.)"

Overall, I have no complaints with service and my experience, but since I stay in so many hotels I think I had higher expectations and anticipated a personal touch that may not be present at some of the larger hotels.),(We spent the ""first"" night of our honeymoon at the Dunhill due to an overnight layover before heading to the tropics. We wanted a hotel with some character and history and found both in the Dunhill. The Dunhill is historic which means it's not the most up-to-date hotel, but it has charm and special quirks such as fresh cookies and milk delivered to your room in the evening! The hotel is located in the heart of Charlotte and just steps from your door, you'll find museums, bars and plenty of restaurants. 

Check-in was seamless and the staff was very friendly. They have a hotel bar and a hotel restaurant, along with complimentary coffee and cookies by the front desk. We also got complimentary wi-fi during our stay. We were only at the Dunhill a short while, but while we were there, our stay was delightful and a great spot to stay during our lay-over!)"

This is of course inspired by the great poet T-Pain. It may not look like much, but DD Peckers is a great hidden gem.

I like a lot of the sauces here, so for me it's hard to pick just one. The sampler platter is a great option if you have a few people with you. Twenty-five wings and you can do five different flavors. Hot flavors always win for me when it comes to wings. The heated versions of gold, garlic, honey, teriyaki are all great. Hoisin may sound odd for wings, but it's really delicious. 

The fried pickles here are spears instead of chips. WIN. I wish everyone would vote spears when it comes to menu decision making involving fried cucumbers soaked in evil. I also like that you can do most of the starters as a half order instead of a full. I don't think the broccoli cheese balls are made in house, but they are a nice little nibble.

Parking can be kind of difficult in this shopping center. I think that may be a blessing a disguise. I mean, I need that little walk after eating that many wings and fried things dipped in ranch.),(Wow. DD Peckers is a little diamond tucked away between Park Rd and Hwy 51. Stuck between other small shops and pubs, you'll want to find your way in, sooner rather than later, to try out this pub grub. 

The wings. Man. Just the plain old mild are where it's at. Big wings with tons of sauce. The Hot Gold are like Carolina Mustard BBQ meets awesome and had a lovechild. Delicious. 

The cheese fries are a little lackluster. Great fries. Seasoned well and crinkle cut. The cheese is just shredded cheese thrown on top. Not my favorite but does well in a pinch. 

The fried pickles are dank. Huge spears and generously breaded. Go for a little ranch or bleu dipping action and you're set. 

The inside is so quaint. Easy to feel right at home at the bar, one of the high-tops or a booth. Sink into the culture a bit more and come in for trivia or watch the game. Great people run this place and the product and atmosphere shine that fact forth gloriously. 

Thanks, DD Peckers. You've got my vote!),(Not impressed

Visited dd Peckers about a week ago and while nice, not outstanding.

My wife had the Chicken Philly and while not great, nothing to write home about.

I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with the Blazing Sauce.  You would expect with blazing, it would be very hot but not the case. Never once had to wipe my brow from sweat and a good medium hot at best.

Still a nice place to go and a dive restaurant but still a good option. Just not a first choice.)"

With the farmer's market, the wine shop, Pure Pizza, a bakery and more, there isn't much floor space left to be had. NJC, on the other hand, hasn't changed a bit.

AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING! They make excellent coffee and I have come around to the richness of what they sling here.

Much better of a hangout joint now with the additional food options, but there is now wifi and power outlets and you can get your parking pass stamped for free\/discounted parking.

I had their caramel steamer (no caffeine, hoorah!) and an iced coffee to go. The steamer was light and sweet and perfectly caramelized. Did you know they make their own caramel here? It was perfect. The iced coffee was deeply flavored and needed no cream or sugar, which for me is a surprise as I usually add both.

Yum!),(I'm falling madly in love with this place.

Not only are the drinks almost too pretty to consume, they are ridiculously delicious. Today's caramel latte design included a heart. Gorgeous. The baristas take great pride in their work and what they serve. It's obvious in every cup. The guy today also had an absolutely tremendous mustache. One of those that you would twist with your fingers and evil laugh because you just tied a damsel to the train tracks.

I love 7th Street Market in general. It's a great place to grab coffee, have a meeting, or sit and do work all day. They also validate parking. Just make sure you keep an eye on the clock. it's only good for an hour and a half. I may or may not move my car every 90 minutes. Go ahead, judge away.

If you love coffee, or hell even if you don't... go here immediately. Be prepared to be blown away.),(James introduced me to the ""pour over."" the best iced coffee I've ever had with counter culture coffee. The place is quaint and has so much personality. It's a great place if you're into specialty coffee for sure. Really stoked about heading back really soon. The only coffee shop in the NoDa area, in my opinion.),(I had a bit of disbelief when I read the first few reviews come in for Not Just Coffee. Could a cozy little shop really serve that much incredible goodness? And I'm happy to report that yes, yes they can. 

A teeny, tiny little place, Not Just Coffee bangs out one of the best iced lattes I've ever had. Smooth, creamy, bold...perfect. As Tonya says, they really do make it with love. And great milk. And fantastic Counter Culture Coffee. They also care about the community and what's going on around them and that's amazing too. 

Do yourself a favor and stop it Not Just Coffee for an incredible beverage and some sweet conversation.),(LOCATION MOVING!!!!
Not sure what the details are, but they are moving to the old Reid's.  As soon as I have the facts I will post.

From the Not Just Coffee headquarters
""Okay so new address is 225 East 7th St. and move in date is sometime around Nov. 10th),(I guess, technically, the name is correct, as there are other things available on the menu (as my mom proved by ordering a hot chocolate). But really, why else would you come here?

It's in what used to be Reid's, one of my favorite grocers ever, and what looked to be something new under construction when I visited in late December of 2011, making this little coffee counter essentially the only reason to come to this entire block of 7th Street. It was neat to see the light rail in operation, something Charlotte never had when I lived here, but that was about the only activity happening here on the Sunday before I flew back up to DC.

They use Counter Culture beans, good stuff, and make a pretty legit latte to pair with a modest honey crumb cake (or whatever the featured one of the day from the local baker happens to be). It's quiet, or at least was then, and pretty easy to get what you want and move along at your own pace.

Overall, not bad coffee, but don't expect a huge amount of other offerings as the store name might allude to. Do expect a bit of pretension, something I generally don't care for with my coffee, especially in my hometown where most folks are much friendlier.),(Recommended by the CLT CM, and decorated with some outstanding ratings, Not Just Coffee was my camp-out spot of choice while in town recently, between meetings. The drive from Durham had left me dazed and yawning, so I was craving a great big cup o' coffee. They actually only do small servings here... So that had me making two orders to get the quantity I wanted. I asked if I could get the cafe wifi password and was told to use the 7th Street Market wifi instead; but unfortunately I wasn't able to connect to that. Luckily, I had my Verizon card on me so I was able to stick around. Coffee was piping hot and pleasant. And the atmosphere, within a market, is bustling and provides places for food or seating aside from the bar surrounding NJC. Honestly, though, I just wasn't as blown away by this cafe's atmosphere, service, or product as much as everyone else seems to be. :(),(I always trek out of my way for coffee here. I keep it simple by typically just ordering an iced latte to go, but it's a damn good latte and worth going out of the way for.

I love the location and all of the cool, small businesses in the surrounding market. In the short time it takes for my order to be ready, I'm always dipping my toe in and out of the little corners of the market. There's so much to take in and your senses will be absolutely delighted.

Plus, drinking my coffee here just makes me feel cooler. It's like, you get insta cool kid points by just ordering here. I know that's lame, but that's why I need their help. 

Until next time...),(Rishi tea. I'm in! I guess that's why they call it not just coffee! For a tea drinker this is lovely!

It was packed around the bar even during a weekday around 9am, so it must be more than just good too! 

Love what looks to be a dedication to their craft and some cool coffee art to admire!),(Located within 7th Street Market, this quaint purveyor of ground goodness certainly offers up an unparalleled cup of caffeine. Seating is limited to a u-shaped bar which, within, you're likely to find a studly James assiduously at work. A steaming kettle of hot water in one hand, this barista-owner makes his modest café famous with the pour-over coffee. Specialty indeed.

A must stop and great overall lil market too.),(It was Just Coffee.  Standard stuff with a standard hipster look and impersonal baristas.  Not worth a stop. 

I travel the country constantly and just rated Urban Standard in Birmingham, Alabama as the best I've ever been to.  Check out that review when you get a chance... there really is no better.  Going to this place in the same week made it worse.

The issue isn't necessarily the coffee, the coffee was ok... nothing to be wowed by... it was the baristas.  They were ignorant.  Like they had better things to do than talk to you even though you were there to order coffee at a bar where they stare at you when they aren't busy.   I tried to talk to one, but I was literally ignored.  Like, I asked how their day was and the person stared at me blankly and walked away.  Who does that?

I also saw a barista grab a spoonful of chocolate sauce and down it because she said she had a sweet tooth.... that's unprofessional and was kinda off-putting for the vibe this place is trying to have... don't slam chocolate sauce that goes into drinks in front of customers at a bar.

When you walk in yo the bright, clean space you can either seat yourself or head to the counter and order for take out. Hubs and I grabbed a seat and oogled at the tasty looking plates that came out of the kitchen. Our server was smiley and swift and before we knew it, our food flew out of the kitchen. Here's what I sampled:

Calamari: 2.5\/5: I can tell the calamari is likely made in house, but the breading was too heavy for my liking and the sauce that accompanied the dish had little flavor. The portion is certainly generous, though. 

Rotisserie chicken: 4\/5: Super juicy and flavorful. The way a rotisserie chicken should be! The two sauces that come with the chicken (green and yellow) are equally as tasty. 

Cilantro rice: 3\/5: This was a fine side item, but I found myself spreading a bit of the green sauce on the rice to kick up the flavor. 

Plantains: 5\/5: Perfectly fried, fresh and delightful. Huge hunks of lovely, slightly crispy plantains. 

Overall value: 4\/5: For $6.50 ish you can get 1\/4 white chicken plus two sides. That's a hell of a deal, especially when the chicken is this delicious and juicy. 

Genaro's is definitely worth a try...next time I need to save room for the tres leches cake!),(Status Update....
 I wrote that the Lomo Saltado, traditional Peruvian dish, season beef with onions, tomatoes and cilantro, caught my eye on the menu on my last visit and we tried it tonight.  May I say if it were a super hero her name would be Super YUM!  Are you ready for this? It was brothy with french fries tossed in it!  When it was put down in front of me, I was thinking I don't know about these soggy fries.  The soggy fries, onion and tomato made the dish!  This restaurant is so delicious and very inexpensive.

I booked on Open Table and arrived to find that the place was barely a quarter filled. Nice. We were immediately seated at a table towards the back, near the very filled wine racks. Sadly, my wife and I aren't wine drinkers but if you are then you'll be pleased. I chose a Catawba draft instead.

The taste of four starter is the way to begin here. Scoops of hummus, tzatziki sauce, red pepper and eggplant with a nice serving of slices whole wheat pitas. Probably too much for two to start with because there was a lot there and we were ""uh, what?"" when our main courses arrived.

My wife chose the lobster ravioli. A very large portion with plenty to bring home, especially after we filled up on the starter. Tasty, creamy, seafoody (is ""seafoody"" a word?) and easy to eat. Delish.

I had the quarter chicken which was served with potatoes and other veggies. A very big portion, there was a lot of flavor and texture in here, with the perfectly al dente potatoes.

Dessert? Well, I guess we can try. We split a piece of baclava which came topped with some sort of (lightly peach-flavored) ice cream\/yogurt. Delish.

STUFFED with a delicious meal. We'll be back.),(Stopped in for lunch today and glad we did.

I had this on my list of places to visit for sometime now but finally made it. I'm President of a HOA in Cornelius and we're getting ready to do some renovations and one of the bidders just finished doing the same type of work less than a mile from here. I volunteered to come down and take some pictures and guess what, accomplished two things today.

As we walked up the door, the hostess on the inside opened the door from my wife and myself and invited us in. Good Start. Then she escorted us to our table and our server showed up a short time later with ice water and menus. We gave our beverage orders and when he returned we had decided on what we wanted for lunch and with this menu with so many choices, it was difficult.

My wife took a chance of ordered Scallops over Risotto. The reason I said took a chance is that she rarely orders Scallops because the tend to be either over cooked and hard and rubbery or under cooked and a bit on the slimy side.  These were perfect and she ate everything on her plate. She's on a diet and rarely eats an entire course. The Mushroom Risotto which was the base for the Scallops was excellent.

I had the Lamb Burger with a side of Fries.  I normally order Lamb cooked medium rare to medium because it's too easy to over cook. This burger came out great. Full of flavor, juicy and a taste treat.  It was accented with Feta Cheese as well. The Fries were not the Shoe String cut we normally get but rather sliced potatoes that were fried and they were delicious.

In the course of lunch, the manager came over and inquired if we were satisfied which is normally the hallmark of a well run restaurant. Good hands on touch by all of the staff.

I tried the following:

1) ""Greek Style"" Pork Ribs (with coriander, lemon, olive-cabbage slaw, cucumber yogurt) - my manager (from work) ordered this and I got to try some.  Lucky me!  This is definitely a MUST GET item!  The meat was fall off the bones with the perfect amount of seasoning!

The server brings your food out and there are no biscuits on the plates. What? Wait? Where are the flaky, yummy biscuits? It was as if the server could read our minds... he said, ""we have biscuits in the oven right now. We'll bring them out as soon as they're ready."" Crisis averted. Let's move on.

I love Dish. It almost feels like you're in a family member's kitchen. Cozy, welcoming. The only thing I don't like about it: they're closed on Sundays. 

I love the chicken and dumplings. Every bite feels like a hug. I've been hooked ever since I watched the triple D episode here. If it's good enough for Guy, then it's a must try. I'm also a big fan of the salmon cakes and collard greens. My friend Jason gets chicken fried steak without the gravy. Blasphemy. Pure blasphemy.

Back to the biscuit situation... in the middle of our meal, here comes a plate of heaven. Warm, delicious biscuits. It was well worth the wait. Now if Jason wouldn't have been so selfish and ordered his gravy on the side... it would have been damn near perfection.

The workers are incredibly friendly. We are always well taken care of here and everyone is so nice. Parking can be a little tricky in this area. Come with patience. 

I'm looking forward to Spring and enjoying my biscuits on the patio.),(Not sure why the rating on this place is so low, but I LOVED this place!  I got a special that isn't on their current menu - tilapia fillet with some type of berry sauce.  DELICIOUS.  The mac and cheese was awesome too - your typical southern mac and cheese.  The chocolate pecan pie was awesome too.  Left the place in that happy-food-coma state.... would recommend to anyone who is looking for a hearty, ""home-cooked"" meal.),(Allow me to go ahead and dish on Dish. Dish is indeed A-OK in my book. 

With kitschy decor, down home grub and solid service, Dish is a solid choice for an affordable and tasty fare in Plaza Midwood. Hubs and I rolled into Dish after three failed attempts at other local restaurants on a Saturday evening. I was not in the mindset to wait an HOUR for a table, so Dish is where we landed!

We grabbed an affordable drink at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for our table - that's a score at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The menu is filled with a variety of options ranging from Fried Green Tomatoes, to Pot Roast, to Shrimp and Grits. While it's definitely not a low cal location, Dish has a variety of dishes that will please just about any palate. 

Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions for both appetizer and main course. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Overall, not a bad dish. Small fried greenies with a tangy dill dipping sauce. I was hoping for more flavor in the breading - from what I could tell it was just flour and egg...no pepper, no additional spices, etc. 

About 15 minutes later I dug into my Chicken & Dumplings - a moderate and well priced portion of the milky soup stuffed with long bits of shredded chicken and hearty dumplings. It was well made and hearty - but again, it was lacking flavor. Boatloads of pepper were added. For my side, I chose the sweet potato mash which was indeed sweet - almost too sweet for my liking! And that's saying quite a bit. 

The gratis honey biscuit and deviled egg really were stars of the meal, though! The biscuit came out warm with a honey glaze...I promptly devoured my biscuit in 30 seconds flat. YUM. The deviled egg was super fresh and perfectly crafted. 

So, while Dish wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had it was comforting, solid and very affordable. If I find myself in a pinch next time I'm in PM, Dish is on my short list.),(Not an extensive breakfast menu but nicely done.

We were looking for someplace for a breakfast\/brunch and decided to give Dish in the Plaza Midwood Section of Charlotte a try.

Parking in this area can be a bit of a challenge but we ended missing a turn and circling the block and when we did, we ended up with a spot of the side of the street almost in front of the restaurant. Got lucky for a change.

Interesting interior with local artwork but again, this is one of the arts district in Charlotee.

We were seated immediately which was not surprising since we were there 10 minutes after their 10am opening time. Would have liked to have tried their lunch menu but since I had a hair appointment to cut the little that I have left at 12:30, breakfast it was.

It's not an extensive breakfast menu unlike their dinner menu but what we did try was pretty good. I had the Carolina Country Breakfast which was Eggs cooked anyway you want them, bacon, hash brown casserole, grits and biscuit with sausage gravy on the side.

In general very good. Eggs and the bacon was perfect. hash browns were good although I would have liked the potatoes to be a little less crunchy. The Grits were pretty good and that's amazing since I don't even like Grits. The Biscuit was excellent. A nice Southern Style. Sausage gravy needs work since there was no sausage flavor and it was somewhat watery.

My wife had the Lite Breakfast which was Fruit, Bacon, Eggs and they did permit her to substitute Marbled Rye Break as her bread choice.

Her biggest complaint our restaurants that serve fruit, generally serve large portions of Melon and little else. Granted that the cheap way to go. Not the case, here. It did have a couple pieces of Crenshaw Melon but also had Pineapple, Orange Slices and other goodies that made for good variety.

All in all, except for taking a while to cook our breakfast, service was very good and we will be back sometime in the near future late enough to catch the lunch menu),(I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.

The restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.

I was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and ""Chicago"" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.

Like other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.

Our server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance.),(Southern food should make you happy, it should as my friend Arry S. puts it so plainly, ""it's like being hugged... from the inside out."" 

Dish does that, you can only feel like the happy slowly filling you from the inside out.  I mean look, it's a simple location, a diner, by all traits.  It's not Johnny Rockets diner, it's the corner, hole in the wall diner, that you bring a girlfriend, wife, or someone you care about, for food that you wished your mom cooked every day for you.  

In a bowl of warmth, you find yourself knee deep in Tomato Soup, a creamy, buttery, tangy, gritty all-in-one smart dish. Served with a buttermilk biscuit, brushed with butter, you can't ask for more for a starter.  The Chicken and Dumplings is that little slice of goodness, it's like the stuff your mother decided, to reward herself, but thought you might like it also.  The chicken was tender, and the dumplings were nicely done.  The Mac and Cheese, was the kind you find in Southern Cooking.  It's not the creamy kind you find in the fridge section, but the made-by-some-person-in-your-kitchen-sensibility and taste.  You may want some crazy cheese sauce, but this is the kind that makes you realize, they make it the way you make it at home, but just a little bit better. 

Okay, I'm not from the south, but I have been to every state in the US.  There are great foods out there, and really, this places shows that you don't have to execute gastro-etymology, to show case, the simple home like flavors that make this place a must visit.),(Great spot. Definite dive feel. Definite locals feel. A neighborhood gem I was told.

Stopped in for a quick dinner and ordered the salmon cakes with collard greens. Salmon cakes was a new thing to me. Not sure I would ever take something so good and make it into a cake again but I found the dish to be fairly decent. The collard greens tasted fresh. Now... The star of this entire meal was the biscuit and sweet potato. They were part of the main course but damn did I feel like I was enjoying dessert. So good that instead of eating everything together like I normally do I had to save these toe things for last. I highly recommend a visit even for just a biscuit and sweet potato!)"

Now that that's clear, let's focus on the food & experience. 

The restaurant hosts clean lines, bright walls and nice lighting. Hubs and I chose to sit out on the patio and enjoy a late dinner. Our waiter, Stuart, was incredibly friendly and led us through the menu with ease. A few glasses of wine later, we were ready to order.

The carrots had the perfect amount of sweetness and were by no means overcooked. And lastly, the mac and cheese was heart attack worthy and delightful. Price wise, I think $13 was a completely fair (and affordable) price for this plate of food. The portions aren't gargantuan, but they are plenty large for the price! 

We finished off the evening with strawberry shortcake - made with biscuits, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. While the treat was refreshing and tasty, the biscuits were a bit stiff and the portion was on the smaller side. Thus, I need to come back and try the coconut chess or chocolate pie. Oh woe is me. 

I'm looking forward to coming back for another royal dinner at King's Kitchen...if I were to grab lunch here I may fall into an afternoon food coma!),(So it was time to pay this place another visit.

I was CRAVING their fried chicken in addition to their deviled eggs for which I partook of both.

I threw in a pecan pie a la mode for good measure........and all was right in the world.

FYI...they are opening a bakery next door (on Church Street) that from the street and peering through the windows will serve baked breads and sandwiches for the lunch crowd.....another great reason to patronize this place for all the good it does.),(What a bummer.  We were in town on a business trip and decided to check out The King's Kitchen based on some glowing Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, it ended up being a complete fail.

Shrimp and Grits:  The grits were lukewarm and clumpy.  The shrimp were small and lukewarm.  
Vegetable Side:  SALTY.  Overcooked mush.
Fried Oysters:  Decent, but some were a bit soggy.
Hot Pimento Dip:  Probably the highlight of the meal.  
Sweet Potato Fritters:  Awful.  All you could taste was clove(?).  

The server was sweet, but seemed out of it.  

Last but not least, the printed beer menu was ~80% wrong.  Instead of just telling us what was on tap, the server simply responded ""sorry, we don't have that"" to nearly every beer on the menu.  To get the REAL list I had to finally ask, ""so can you just tell me what you do have?""  Pain in the ass.),(Soul food at its finest. I live in the neighborhood and have passed The King's Kitchen time and time again, so a few weeks ago I finally came in for lunch. It's in a great Uptown location just off Tyron and nestled on the corner across from the park. We sat along a window and ordered iced tea, received a variety of bread (love some cornbread!) and ordered our lunch entrees. I got flounder with a choice of 3 sides- I opted for mac and cheese, green beans and cole slaw. Y-u-m! 

The best part about King's Kitchen is that it's for a good cause- from the website:

""We're a not for profit restaurant serving up southern cuisine made with fresh, local ingredients from right here in our community. And the proceeds go back to the community, helping to feed those in need. So, come on in. Because when you dine, the whole community thrives.""

I'm a big fan of supporting those in need, so King's Kitchen gets an extra star for this alone. Looking forward to my return!

Fun tip: they have great pastries in the morning. My boyfriend got a spiced muffin and scones on his way to work- they should definitely advertise this, because they'd knock the competition out of the park.),(I love the concept and the great things this place does for the community and less fortunate. For that, I would give them a 5 star. However, grading them on my meal I have to go lower. 

I got the following meal to go since I got there right before closing.

Fried chicken with side of asparagus, mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. The chicken was decent but not that fresh and all of the sides were disappointing and salty.

Maybe I just got an end of day batch but I had higher expectations from this place based on the hype from many.),(I was excited to try King's after all the great reviews but come on people, this was garbage. We ordered our food and it came in 4 minutes, really? The chicken had been cooked ahead of time, not crispy, soggy on bottom from sitting around. You get your choice of sides if they didn't runout of it. I had the green beans, they should  have told me they were from a can, so disgusting. The mac & cheese was lumpy and not hot. The slaw was ok. The waiter didn't know what beers they had, he went and asked. He poured my beer in a glass until the foam was overflowing onto the table. This restaurant is a joke! If you like buffet style taste and quality then this is the place for you!)"

And wow, what a spot. If you had asked me yesterday what was the best food choice in CLT, I'd have said the burger bar in C. Now, I'm not so sure.

1897 has it all. Pizzas made to order in a gas oven. Sandwiches made to order. A large selection of grab-and-go that looks amazingly awesome. There was a container of Queen Charlotte's Pimiento Cheese in there that caught my eye. Mmmmm... tasty!

And to top it all off, a large bar on the atrium side that has local brews on tap! Yep, even the award winning Hop-Drop-And-Roll and my own favorite, the Jalapeno Pale Ale. Jeez, Louise. I might have to arrange more layovers here just to eat!),(Hmmm - the 1897 Market - we've all waiting so long for this place to open and it was worth the wait.

This place is perhaps the best place in the entire airport! Check out the pictures everyone is taking and you will agree it's amazing. Clean - new - great staff - fresh food - decent pricing and a huge variety - they even sell a few items - shop - eat - drink - relax and it seems like it's always close to my gate!

This place is a GREAT new addition to one of MY favorite airports!),(I appreciated 1897 Market because, when you're stuck eating at an airport, food options tend to be limited, and are normally insanely repetitive and uncreative in nearly every airport one travels through (think Sbarro pizza, McDonalds, Cinnabon, etc.).  Here at Charlotte airport they do have a handful of more unique and creative food and drink options vs. many other airports, and on my most recent layover here I was happy to find this place, the 1897 Market.

This venue offers several options, everything from a full ""be seated by a hostess and be served"" restaurant experience, to a made to order pizza bar, to another area where they have a display cooler for those who just want to grab a sandwich, salad or other cold foods and drinks to go, or to quickly enjoy here.

They have an interesting seating area for the people who get the ""to go"" items, which is laid out more like a cozy and rustic living room with couches, comfy seating and a large flat screen TV on the wall.  Otherwise, to go customers are banished to a set of high tables with stools (and power connections for laptops, phones and other devices), but ""to go"" customers are reminded that they are not to sit at any of the low tables with chairs, as those are only for customers who are here for full restaurant service.  Prices aren't horrible, I had a rather large and filling cobb salad for $9 and a bottle of Vitamin Water for $4.),(Pretty decent place for the Charlotte airport. Picked up a nice ham sandwich to go for my flight. But noticed they were cooking up lots of fresh items, and like how they laid out the restaurant with many great options.),(Why 4 stars? Because this is one of the better options at CLT.

   ---   ---   ---

""Eatin' good"" is tough to do while traveling, so I set a very low standard for meal with this pass-through: find something healthy. I chose 1897 because their mission was fresh food, and they had a few different salad options.

And then I ordered the pretzel burger because I have a problem.

My burger was solid, but I was kicking myself for passing on the french onion soup. I sat at the end of the bar, right next to the open kitchen and watched delicious french onion soup being distributed time after time after time. I will definitely be trying that out on my next visit. My parmesan fries were fine, in its place.

The only gripe I had was that during my visit, the Charlotte Hornets were playing a playoff Game 7, and the TV's were on ESPN2, which had bowling on. I asked a couple times for them to switch the TV's, but it didn't happen until about my 5 minutes before I had to leave. That may sound nit-picky, but how do you not have your local team's big playoff game on, and why does it take 15-20 minutes to change the channel?

At any rate, this will probably be my stop at future visits to the airport. Next time, I'll get the salad (and the french onion soup, of course.)),(Full bar with a huge selection of beer, some on tap but mostly bottles and cans. They do have local beer. 

For food they have some seafood options with oysters. They also have pizza, burgers, and salads. All gourmet  and made with fresh ingredients. 

I had the salmon salad, just perfect for a healthy airport dinner. I also had a local beer that was solid, some Nola white. 

The staff was nice and worked fast.),(I tried out 1897 Market on a recent layover at CLT airport.  I was grumpy and just wanted something to eat.  I tried the sushi place, but the line was too long for my 1 hr connection.  Getting increasingly frustrated, I stumbled into 1897 Market and was amazed by its size and great energy.  I was immediately seated and my waitress had my iced tea in under 5 min.  There is also grab and go seating for when it is crowded.  It is like a fully stocked c-store with a restaurant!  My mood suddenly started to lighten up!
I tried to be semi healthy and went with the carved turkey cobb.   This was an amazing salad!!!  It was loaded with some of the best turkey I can remember.  The sharp blue cheese, crispy bacon, egg and yummy croutons all mixed into a wonderful combination that was anything but an ordinary salad.  It was a big salad, but the tiny portion of iceberg lettuce reassured me that this was a healthy choice. The large menu contains sandwiches, salads, BBQ, mac and cheese along with some pretty good looking pizzas.  
My server was really good!  She kept refills coming on iced tea and had a huge smile.  The whole experience was great from start to finish - I highly recommend 1897 Market!  This is my new go to spot when travelling to Charlotte Airport.),(CLT layover junkies, unite! In my unintentional quest to eat at every spot at the Charlotte airport, 1897 Market was next on my hit list. 

I asked to be seated at a table, rather than a hightop near the bar since I was in the mood for  a more leisurely meal. The hostess led me around and around to a seating area near the marketplace. This place is big! 

To eat, I ordered a pizza and Caesar salad. In true airport dining fashion, the food came out quick! I was actually impressed by the quality of the pizza. It was thin, crispy, and had a nice balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. 

The only turnoff was the very end when it took seemingly forever to pay. My waiter was staring at the TV and it was nearly impossible to catch his gaze. Like I said, I wasn't in a huge rush but it got to the point where I almost went across the restaurant just to get him to grab my check. For that reason, I probably wouldn't recommend sitting down if you don't have a good chunk of time to kill. 

Frustrations aside, I took a look at the small market setup on the way out which was a redeeming quality of 1897. They have locally made shirts, popcorns, sweets, and other goodies that are a step above what you'll find at other airport shops. 

Chances are I'll be back at CLT very soon and would most likely come back. Next time, I'd probably take up the host's offer to sit closer to the bar for hopefully better service.),(My husband and I had a ""date"" here when we were stuck in the Charlotte Airport for a few hours.  The menu is small but you can get sandwiches, salads, or entrees so there is something for anyone.  Its an open kitchen concept so I like that I can see what's going on with my food. 
I had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a burger.  Both were really good.  The meats were juicy and the toppings were spot on.  The fries were coated in parmesan and were crispy and hot.  The service was friendly but on this night kind of on the slow side.  No biggie when we needed something, we got it, so it didn't hold us up at all.  The pilot at the table next to us had a pasta dish that looked amazing.  I'll have to try that sometime.   All in all a good choice for a nice relaxing dinner at the airport.  If we didn't have our suitcases next to us I would have never guessed I was in an airport.),(My family and I arrived at the Charlotte airport at like 11pm and we were huuuuungry!! Thankfully this cute marketplace was still open and even though they were getting ready to close, the employees were still so courteous and eager to help me. I loved this place! It was super charming and I wish I could have spent more time there. They had a small area to lounge, while you drink coffee and\/or read a book. This was very atypical of those run-of-the-mill airport store, where you just go in to buy a stick of gum and a newspaper. I loved how inviting this place with artisanal offerings and freshly packed food boxes for those that were on the go. If only we got in earlier and had a longer layover, I would have spent more time there. Their menus looked amazing from all the Yelp photos and of course I was left with my mouth watering. Next time at Charleston airport, note to self: visit 1897 Market, order a meal and order a cocktail! I walked away with a snack pack of fruit, cheese and crackers. Luckily it did not cost an arm & a leg and it even filled up the fams.),(February 12, 2016 Friday - 3:30 PM for late lunch

Service - 4 stars 

Background - Travelling across the country and finally have time to sit down and eat.

Atmosphere - I walked up to the hostess station.  She took me to my table, it looked like a tiny place from the front but she kept winding me through more and more tables.  The only problem is that they give you these metal chairs after sitting on airplane seats.  Please give me more comfortable chair.

Food
  Drinks - I had two different local IPA beers, first was a can of Over the Edge and later a 14 ounce draft of Hop Drop 'N Roll.  Excellent choices.

  My Main Course - I went with a Charlotte Burger.  I guess I was too hungry, I ate half of it before I knew it.  It was a solid burger but nothing that special.

Service - Speed was a thing here, but I had a two and half layover.  But the beers still seemed to take a long time to come to me.

Future - Sure.),(This place has one of the best burgers I've ever had. I have sent so many people here. I travel every week and used to always eat here. But today's customer service experience has sealed their fate. I have had over an hour wait. I have been bathed at by bartenders, and I have been told I cannot call in a to-go order. Really?

Step 2. Grab the appropriate bag and a marker.
Step 3. Work your way down the bag, x'ing off which cheese you want, what sauces you want, what veggies you want, hot or cold, extra meat. All of that is SO FLIPPING CLEVER. And you do it at your own pace.

When it's done, write a name at the bottom. Now, you could be normal and boring, writing your own name. Yeah, that's been done. But be outstanding and put something smart like ""Voldemort"" or ""Darth Vader"" or ""Bruce""!

Insert slow clap here. That's right, $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC) Monday through Saturday from 4-7pm AND 10pm to midnight. I love to come here after Hornets games for oysters and rosè. I make sporting events classy, y'all. 

I primarily come here for oysters, but if I'm looking for more I usually get the corn fritters or the lobster roll. I'm a sucker for lobster rolls and this one is fresh and delicious. Again, shout out to Kseniya M for the corn fritters rec. I would've never thought to order those here and they are so good. The catfish reuben is pretty unique and tasty. You can also place orders online to pick up. 

The patio is a nice spot to people watch. I personally enjoy sitting in front of the raw bar so I can watch them prep the oysters. I find it fascinating. How on earth are they able to crank through so many and not cut themselves?!

Free parking alert: Sea Level validates for the Hearst Tower deck, so make sure you bring your parking ticket in with you.),(A group of my colleagues and I happened to be at Hearst Tower today and decided to try out Sea Level, a new restaurant located in the Hearst Tower that had just opened earlier this month.  On a Wednesday night, there were no reservations required as I think the restaurant is still fairly new and it's still pretty slow.  We were accommodated quickly.

I want to note that the service here, while a little bit slow, was great.  Our server was very friendly and there were always people asking us (a little too much sometimes) if we were done with our dish so they could clear it out.  Water was always full.  The GM also came over to chat and to make sure everything was alright, which we appreciated.

Prices are reasonable for seafood.

The food was a little lackluster... perhaps there are still a few kinks to sort out as this is such a new restaurant:

- No bread basket - you have to order it separately and it comes with a nice onion spread.

- Sea Level and Blue Point oysters - one of them, which I assume is the Sea Level, was itty bitty teeny tiny (I'm very small and have very small hands - see picture for scale) - literally smallest oyster I've ever seen.  However, both oysters were fresh (I haven't gotten sick!) and had a nice salty brine flavor.  Comes with all the condiments.

- Squid chow chow - we had no idea what a chow chow was and should have asked.  It's basically fried calamari tossed in peppers and onions in a sweet\/spicy sauce.  It was really, really greasy and I felt like I was eating more batter than I was squid.  I had to spit out one that was all batter and no squid.  The flavors were good, though.

- Mussels - these were my favorite of the evening.  The sliced grilled baguettes went well with the butter\/white wine\/lemon sauce and the mussels were aplenty and fairly fresh.  I would recommend getting these!

 - Lobster roll - unfortunately, both my coworker and I found lots of shell pieces in the lobster salad, which we both bit into.  My piece of shell was quite large and she had many little pieces in hers.  The GM was nice enough to comp both rolls, which was a nice gesture.  It's understandable that they might have some pieces of shell in them since they apparently get these really fresh and make their lobster salads on the spot, but it's still not an excuse - I've never had a shell problem with any lobster roll I've had.  The cole slaw had a nice pickled flavor to it, but I didn't eat much of it.

Overall, an okay place to have a dinner with colleagues as there is a lot of space and it's conveniently located in Hearst Tower, but I think there's still a few hiccups to remediate since it's so new.),(Yes, I'm in the South. Yes, I'm in BBQ heaven. But can I have something a little lighter and refreshing? Something that doesn't make me feel like I need to hit the gym to burn it all off?

Thank you, Sea Level NC for answering my wishes!

My coworker and I snagged a table on Monday night, finding the place with plenty of seating left, but the room still abuzz with people who just got off from work and want to enjoy a cocktail after a long day. The menu is simplistic, but offers a variety of seafood dishes, both small and large. In dire need of something besides meat, we got the Maine mussels in whine garlic sauce as an appetizer to share, and then for an entree I chose the tile fish filet with an assortment of vegetables and sriracha aioli. 

Our waiter for the night was Andrew who was wonderfully charismatic and made us feel comfortable with ease. His consistent check-ups on us throughout the night as well as useful recommendations made for a lovely dinner. His service was phenomenal!

When the mussels hit our table, I could already smell the garlic butter sauce, making my mouth water instantly. The portion was GIGANTIC which meant my coworker and I weren't going to have to fight for any mussels because my goodness, were they good! Each mussel shell had plenty of meat inside that was tender and buttery. The sauce was delectable, especially when paired with the toasted bread. Great start!

Not too soon after, my entree of the tile fish arrived and was beautifully presented on a bed of crispy kale with bright, cubed pieces of sweet potatoes strewn throughout. The aioli sauce added a nice kick of heat while the fish was flaky. The exterior was a tad bit saltier than I would have liked and there were some pieces of the fish that were hard. At one point, I thought I had eaten a bone, but it was actually just a tiny sliver of skin that was over fried. The kale retained its crunchy bite and the sweet potatoes were soft. It was a deliciously light entree that left me feeling full without all the guilt.

In fact, I ended up ordering a shot of dessert which contained layers of marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate, very similar to a deconstructed s'more. The marshmallow was a bit too sweet and stuck to my teeth, but the dark chocolate underneath would have appeased any chocolate lover. It was creamy, it was rich, and it was the perfect way to end the night. 

Sea Level NC embodies both a classy atmosphere and delectable food. There were so many dishes I wanted to try and if given the chance, I would come back in a heartbeat. Sea Level NC was amazing!),(First of all y'all, I'm not fluent in the language of seafood. However, whenever I see food, I eat it.
The first time I tried raw oysters was two years ago at the The Olde Bar, in Philadelphia. Few weeks ago, I had my first oyster in Charlotte here at the Sea Level NC. I got 2 oysters from Sea Level, NC ($1each.) For the second time, I was very intimidated, I tried to copycat people seated around me, and I did good. I also had the Corn Fritters, I think I'm hooked.

Nestled near Atherton and Ice House comes Zucca. A small place based out of Atlanta with a great menu and beverage selection. We made it in on a rainy Friday evening before the dinner rush started. 

The inside is quaint. One of the old mills gutted turned resto. I love this feel. There are so many of these in Charlotte, yet, each has so much character and appeal. There is a big patio\/deck in the works and should be ready by the end of the year. The booths are really comfy and could easily seat 6 to 7. 

Not too keen on the the jukebox and some of the other materials at the tables. Seems a little to off kilter for their aesthetic. I say, stick to killer food and a good vibe. They definitely have that. Also, there are a lot of TVs around. I'm not  huge fan of shows or sports while I eat. I think the company and food offering should be centric, but hey, it's not the end of the world. 

Since we had pizza earlier that day, we decided to sample a few other choices from the menu. Here's our experience:

My wife ordered the penne pommodoro. Wow. Just wow. Smoky tomato sauce with huge grape tomatoes. Typically, pasta dishes at pizza joints are just noodles with pizza sauce. Not this guy. Really taken a step up and made something special out of this. The buffalo calamari is bangin'. Wow. I'm a sucker for buffalo sauce and with calamari, you can't go wrong. The cheese sticks were mediocre. Nothing you haven't had before. 

I'm psyched to try the pizza on my next visit. I think Zucca has potential and will definitely become a greatly known place for regulars in the near future! Cheers, fellas!)"

I had the New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp (sautéed with butter, garlic, beer and a variety of Cajun\/Creole spices. Served over rice). This dish was top notch and made me very happy.

Taking down one star because the service could have been better and more friendly.

They have live music upstairs but since I was here to catchup with old co-workers, we took the first floor so we could talk.

Will be back during a future CLT trip.),(Delicious!

I've been here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner and I thought it was great both times.  At dinner I ordered the blackened chicken and tortellini special and it was great, only complaint was there werent enough tortelliini but it was made up by the overabundance of chicken.

This used to be Tijuana Flats. Before that, Italian Pie. For all you true Charlotteans out there, you'll always remember it as the legendary Wad's Soda Shop that had a nearly 40 year run here. 

My friend and I got two cocktails from the living libations section of the menu: the Cilantro (tequila, cucumber, jalapeño) and the Thyme (bourbon, peach, honey, bitters). Both were delicious. You've probably figured out by now from my reviews that I always go for any drink with some spice. I like that the wine is served as four ounce pours (don't worry, the price reflects that). 

Food wise we decided on the octopus (perfectly cooked), mac & cheese gratin  (leeks, shallots, 5 cheeses, awesomeness), forbidden rice & mushroom paella, NC Mountain trout, and baklava. An absolutely fantastic meal, but I would have to say the biggest surprise was how delicious the quinoa was that came with the fish. It had a citrusy flavor twist to it. I could eat an entire bowl by itself. We split all the food, including the fish. It was a good sized piece. Next time, I want to try the gelato and the beet salad. Both sound pretty amazing. 

The decor is rustic and beautiful, even the background music was great. There's a long community table in the middle. It was packed when we walked in, but we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Service was top notch. Our server Matt was amazing. On top of that, the manager stopped by to check on all the tables as well. The parking lot is kind of small. If it's full, check the side street off East. It's ja short walk. 

This kind of feels like a place Dilworth has been waiting for and needing. Congrats to Kid Cashew, I look forward to coming back.),(Three colleagues and I came to Kid Cashew on a beautifu day, in which we enjoyed sitting at the outside dining area of Kid Cashew.  If at all possible, I would highly recommend enjoying your meal outside.

Our waitress, though I forgot her name, was a little scary.  She did not give a good vibe and the 4 of us felt a little put off by her.  She had a slight attitude and it was really hard to get her (or anyone else's) attention for long periods of time.  Apparently we were told it was very busy that evening.  

Drinks - excellent, unique cocktails that were delicious - would highly recommend.

While the place gets rave reviews by my fellow Yelpers, I thought this place was just decent food-wise.  We started with the duo of spreads - pass on the hummus, but the tzatziki was so, so good!!  Worth a try as an appetizer.  The mac and 5-cheese side dish was also very good - cheesy for sure, but very good.  The brussel sprouts were just okay for me - I've had much better elsewhere and these didn't have the crisp I like.

For my main dish, I debated a long while and finally went for the lamb burger.  See, I LOVE lamb burgers, especially with feta cheese, but this just wasn't memorable for me.  I didn't end up finishing it.  Not sure what it was exactly - maybe a lack of seasoning?  It came with potato chips.  I guess it just didn't have as much of that gamey lamb flavor I love also.

Dessert was a huge fail for us.  They don't have an actual dessert menu - just ice cream and baklava.  We wanted ice cream and our ice cream came in the form of soft serve, half melted.  Who serves half-melted soft serve in a glass and calls it ice cream?  The baklava was also mediocre for us, unfortunately.

Food was okay, service could be improved, and dessert was a pass for us, but nevertheless I don't regret trying the place!),(Great Diner after a long day on a plane from LA.

Got up early in Brentwood\/LA and caught a early flight from LAX.  5 hours later and we arrive at Charlotte Douglas and I was in no mood to tackle I-77 traffic between the airport and Cornelius so decided to have dinner down in Charlotte.

Thought of a couple places but they were either closed or a drive in so ended up at Kid Cashew which oddly enough had been on list of restaurant to try anyway.

Walked in and was promptly seated and presented with a menu and the took my order for Sweet Tea right away.

One item on the menu piqued my interest and that was the Knocks Your Socks Off BBQ.

I love Eastern NC Style BBQ and the Pulled Pork with Cole Slaw and a dressing that was described as a mixture of vinegar and peppers on Brioche translated to me a dressed up Eastern NC BBQ so I went with it.

I was not disappointed.  It was delicious. Nice and meaty with a moist smoky taste. I don;t normally like Cole Slaw unless I make it myself but this was delicious with a hint of Citrus.

Chips were great.

Don't normally eat desert but the talked me into a Gelato with Caramel Sauce and nuts.

Overwhelming.in size with great taste.

Excellent somewhat upscale atmosphere in a tastefully styled restaurant. Staff and manager are very friendly and will do anything they can to make your visit pleasurable.)"

That happened to me at Zaxby's.

I had their Zaxby's Club, which is a breaded and fried chicken breast (I don't think they have anything that's not fried) with bacon and cheese and lettuce and tomato on the most unhealthy and delicious Texas toast. With a big pile of crunchy fries. There was a pickle under there somewhere but by the time i had uncovered it, I wasn't interested. It was delicious and I ate every bite of the sandwich, mopping up a decent amount of ketchup with the tasty fries. Yum.

And then on the way to the bin to drop my tray, I saw another guest with a plate of a dozen or so wings that looked awesome. Even yummier looking than my sandwich. Next time, Zaxby's. Next time...)"

Not very busy as the dinner hour was just beginning. We had excellent service from a friendly waitress who kept drinks refilled and didn't seem to mind that we did not save room for dessert.

My wife opted for the pulled pork platter and she must have really enjoyed it because there wasn't much left at the end. I managed to snag a piece and it was moist and tasty.

For my main, I chose the half barbecue chicken. A good amount of sauce on this bird kept it moist and the meat tore off easily with a well wielded knife and fork. The potato salad was excellent, mixed through with egg. The mac & cheese was also very good with a firm consistency that was more noodles than cheese. Tasty. A very good portion of chicken and sides.

Definitely will return. Maybe I won't wait five years next time...),(Raise your hand if you come here for the pasta salad. Just me? Oh, okay. 

If you don't like wings, you are not allowed to join me for a meal here. Why? Because it doesn't matter if I'm full or not very hungry when I walk in the door, we're getting wings as an app. They are smoked in house, grilled, and freaking delicious. My favorite sauce is the calypso. It's a mix of terriyaki and buffalo. Finally, someone who gets me. Other places look at me strangely when I ask if it's possible to mix those two sauces together. I agree with the lovely Allyson D, I am a fan of the queso as well. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a girl that can get down with barbecue. However, my go to here (after the wings) is a veggie plate because I am obsessed with their pasta salad. They also have some of the best mac and cheese in the city. Hi, I'm Nikki and I order the veggie plate with the most calories. The fried squash is made in house, not frozen. Green beans, collard greens, if I didn't have any self control I would probably order a six item veggie plate. 

McKoy's has a cool dive and biker bar type feel to it. When the weather warms up, they do a weekly bike night. I've always had great service here. Good drink, lunch, dinner, and happy hour (food) specials throughout the week. Check out there Facebook page or website for the latest. There's also plenty of TVs (if you're into that kind of thing).),(To me, barbecue is a bit like pizza...even when it's not great, it's still really good. But McKoy's is pretty delicious in its own right and is a definite barbecue competitor in Charlotte. 

I didn't sit inside, so I'll just comment on the outdoor space. The porch area is really great to grab a meal with friends, have a drink and just chill. Do I wish the view was better? Sure, but hey, there's not much you can do about that! Our server was very sweet, friendly and helpful. She made sure we enjoyed our meal, our glasses were full and beers kept a-coming. 

On to the food...I ordered the small barbecue platter with green beans and mac 'n cheese. Yay for two sides! The 'cue was solid - a pile plump pulled pork. My only gripe? It was on the dry side...I felt like I really had to douse on the sauce. The sides, however, were just about perfect. The mac 'n cheese was nom worthy, baked in all its goodness. And the green beans were a total surprise - fresh, crisp green beans with a very light saute in garlic and other tasty concoctions. It's a rarity that I find something fresh (not fried or saucy) at a NC bbq joint. 

To wrap up the meal, I just had to order dessert after I heard about coconut pie. Yes, coconut pie. This slice of heaven was reminiscent of a mashup of pecan pie and a macaroon. It's truly swoon worthy, especially when it's warmed and topped with whipped cream. I'll go back *just* for the pie. McKoy's is definitely on my 'cue short list in Charlotte!),(I went to McKoy's today for lunch, I don't know what made me happier, the fried squash that you couldn't touch because it was served so hot, the beautiful mac & cheese with the browned, crusty cheese or the southern, pork infused collards.  Along with the great food, we also had terrific service.

Another great thing about McKoy's is they are open in the middle of the day, that weird time when you don't know if restaurants are open. A great bar area and plenty of outdoor seating.  

I am just going to up my stars to five, there's just no reason not to.),(After a whole day of flying from SFO to Houston and finally to Charlotte, my coworker and I were running on EMPTY. Since we had such a late flight, there weren't a lot of options left for a Sunday night dinner, but when we stumbled upon McKoy's Smokehouse & Saloon that boasted a four star rating and was open until 2 am, it was practically a no brainer to get there and refuel.

As expected, the restaurant wasn't very crowded, but for a Sunday night, we were surprised to find a decent number of parties enjoying a late dinner like we were. We were offered a ""late night"" menu that had basic BBQ sandwiches, platters, and various sides like fries, coleslaw, and salads. Starving, I chose the McKoy's hamburger with a side of mac and cheese.

Considering the lack of a crowd, I was surprised that the wait for food was a bit lengthy, but I suppose that just meant the food was cooked fresh. Presentation wise, the hamburger was massive with vibrant fresh veggies piled on a charred beef patty and a large bun. The mac and cheese was strangely presented like a hump, but it looked pretty good.

Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. The one thing that lacked from the entire entree was SEASONING. How could a BBQ place be so bland? I'm not one to put ketchup on burgers, but my goodness, I practically drizzled the condiment ALL OVER my burger just to get the taste of something besides charred meat and bread. (Charred is putting it lightly; it practically veered towards burnt.) Then on top of the severely under seasoned burger was the mac and cheese that was coated with what felt like congealed cheese. Where was the ooze? Where was the creaminess? It honestly tasted like they used day-old cheese to coat the macaroni pasta. 

I walked in starving, so to be perfectly honest, my standards were quite low, but even then, I couldn't find anything in my dish to be impressed about. The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because the service was friendly and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. I'm not too sure where the ""saloon"" part comes in, but it's definitely a bar where you can watch any game imaginable on FIFTEEN television screens strewn all over the walls. 

Did I finish what I ordered? I was too hungry not to.
But was I that hungry that I couldn't tell McKoy's was an absolute disappointment? No way.),(It was Cinco de Mayo, so of course Nicole and Todd offered to take me somewhere to get BBQ. And being of the mindset that any BBQ is pretty good BBQ (generally speaking), I was only too happy to comply. 

We sat on the patio, so I can't really comment in the inside, but the place was hopping and the parking lot full. From the looks of it, they do a business here ripe with regulars, and there's no question the spot was festive if not rollicking that afternoon. Beer selection, while not breathtaking, was solid, and before too long I was pulling on a Yuengling, paired this day with pulled pork (when in NC, right?), fried squash (interesting, curious), and afterward, a taste of pie that the waitress described as 'coconut and pecan pie had a kid, sort of.' And that's pretty much what it tasted like in texture and flavor. 

In all, this wasn't the top 'cue I've had here, but I'd eat it again. Here's hoping there's another consumption holiday on the horizon to make that happen.),(Very cool BBQ restaurant near the airport.  It is an interesting mix of people - look at the vehicles in front in my pics.  The food is very cheap compared to other places I have been, but the quality was just as good. 
Pulled pork platter ($13.99) a huge pile of juicy pork.  Had good mix of meat and some bark.  I used a little of  thicker BBQ sauce which was very good.  The $2 upcharge for large is well worth it
Meal came with 2 large sides!
Mac and cheese was great.  Creamy with a lot of crispy, melty cheese on top!
Collard greens were good.  Perfectly cooked and I liked the seasoning they used.
I got a bun for $1 and now have a large lunch for tomorrow.  
The owner was around and seemed to know a lot of people.  Very friendly guy.  My waitress, Sunny, was very attentive and bubbly.  She has an appropriate name.),(I could get used to this. After a slightly hellish 6 am flight and no food in my belly, McKoy's Smokehouse appeared on my Yelp search while a choir of angels sang in the background (in my brain, at least). I made the short stroll from my airport hotel and was greeted by the friendliest host who called me ""darlin"" and ""sugar."" I'm not sure how I'd react to someone calling me sugar in Colorado, but here I found it endearingly Southern. 

I ordered the BBQ pork platter off of the ""vittles"" menu, which comes with two ""fixins""--I ordered the collard greens and fried okra. I was pretty hungry and went HAM on that pork (get it?), but in all honestly this plate could probably feed a small family. I love North Carolina style BBQ and the super vinegary sauces that come with it, and theirs certainly did not disappoint. The okra was really crispy and collards were perfectly seasoned and not too soggy. For $12, this meal a total steal.

This spot was pretty quiet and tame on a Friday afternoon, but I imagine it gets rowdier during the evening (it is a biker bar, after all). My server, the host, and one of the cooks all came out during my meal to make sure everything was okay--talk about service. McKoy's, thanks for filling me up with pork and assuring me that everything's going to be okay after air travel. I love you.)"

Here's where the bulk of your time should be spent: The Grandma Pizza.

DUDE. I don't know who's grandma this is\/was, but I love her. I'd venture to say she's cooler than my grandma....and my grandma is really freaking cool. The sauce is divine. Balanced well on all levels. Acid, sweet, garlic, and mild. Also, consistently plopped on top of the pie. The cheese is a killer mix and gets nice and crispy along the edges. Then you make it to the crust...my favorite part. A pizza place that isn't scared of making a well-done pie is AWESOME in my book. A flatter style calls for a more well-done finish, in my opinion. It was pure delight. I can see why so many rave about this pie. Read Justin's review. Pretty much how I feel. If you don't try the Grandma Pizza, let's never hang out.),(I almost didn't want to write this review and give Villa Francesca only 3 stars. I say this because our server was sweet and efficient, it's a very convenient location Uptown (not too bad to park) and I'm always on the prowl for tasty Italian. I'm clamoring to get back and try the 'za and I imagine that will likely take it up to the next level. I suppose that's what review updates are for!

Inside, Villa Francesca is a roomy Italian resto with tables a plenty and booths large enough for the whole famiglia. This isn't super fancy pants Italian, and I kinda like it that way. The menu has all the classics: the parms, the pizzas, the pastas, the salads, etc. No doubt even the pickiest of eaters will find something to satisfy their hungry. I also imagine that this place is pretty good for kiddos as the portions are pretty generous and every kid I've ever known loves pizza.

Anywho, I was in quite the mood for stuffed shells this particular day, so that's what I went for. The shells were good - a generous portion of four jumbo stuffed shells baked with a bit of cheese and covered in pomodoro sauce. While I enjoyed half and took the remaining home for a next day lunch, I kept comparing them to other stuffed shells I've had in Charlotte. The flavor of these was nice, albeit a bit salty, the shells were cooked well (a bit al dente) but it was the filling that I wasn't blown away by. The ricotta mix tasted a bit gritty...not creamy and insanely delicious like I'm used to. 

I know I'll be back to try some other items and I think I'll be much happier with the end result. The pizza looked huge and delicious, I'll need to hit that up. So, for now Villa Francesca, see ya later & ciao.),(Been on my wishlist for sometime and today after Church, my wife and I along with my Sister-in-Law decided to try it for Sunday Lunch.  The food is good but you can't enjoy the food for the volume of the music.  Asked the server if they could turn it down but she came back and informed us that the reciever was in the Manager's Office, he was not there and the door was locked.

Came in with a slight allergy headache and left with a throbing one.  If you have ever worked in a rock quarry, they are quiter that this was. Noise level was so high, the server could not even get my order right.  

I ordered a Veal Parm Hero and ended up with a full Platter of Veal Parm that ws very good.  My wife ordered one of the other entrees and ended up with the smaller Hero. Only one who got what she asked for was my Sister-in-Law but how do you mix up a baked Ziti.  In anycase, the reason for the mixup was that the server could not hear us even though we were yelling our orders.

This could be a good place.  Decor is modern industrial, food is a modern touch on Classical Italian dishes. Very good.  While I am a child of the 60's, the music or rather radio selection does not compliment the Italian Cusine thene.

Will probably give them another shot as soon as my hearing returns.),(Last week, I drove by Villa Francesca, I said out loud, "" I want that restaurant to have great pizza by the slice.""  I tried it tonight and it was outstanding.  A fresh pizza came out of the oven and I ordered a slice.  I sat outside on a bench and ate my pizza. It was a little thicker than ""thin"" crust, topped with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella.    The owner came out and introduced himself and offered me another slice!!  It's good to be a girl!
I don't think I want to eat pizza anywhere else in CLT.  My slice was $3.  The menu dinner items were $10-$15.  I can't wait to go back.  They are open on Sunday and outside seating.),(This Italian restaurant was based on a personal recommendation from a colleague of mine while I was staying in Charlotte.  We had been out and about all day and wanted good Italian that wasn't too fancy.  Knowing it was in Uptown Charlotte, we thought it may have been upscale.  It was not.  I was a fun, casual open dining area with a visible kitchen, excellent service and top notch Italian.  From the garlic knots, to the sausage and peppers to the meat calzone, the whole dining experience was excellent.

Very impressive marinara sauce and the dough was cooked just right.

Top recommendation for this little family friend Italian restaurant in the heart of Charlotte.  It is located just behind the Time Warner Arena. 

The prices are very reasonable from 7.00 for a calzone to 12 - 19 for specialty pizzas.  Entries are 10.95 to 17.95.

Great prices for the quality and quantity of food.),(On our ongoing conquest to find decent pizza delivery to our Uptown apartment, we found this menu in our stack and gave it a go last night. We ordered our standard- veggie pizza and a salad- and were told it would take 45 minutes. I'm pretty sure it only took 30, which is a plus. 

So here's the thing... the pizza is HUGE. One size. They only have one size. The gorgonzola salad was pretty delicious, and so was the pizza- better than the other deliveries we have had. I was only able to eat two of the HUGE pieces, and we still had over half of it left. I won't complain about leftover pizza, considering I do love leftover pizza... but it's a little funny that there's only the one, really big, huge size.)"

Salsarita's is overpriced and fairly plain, but I'll give them this: it's not bad at all. Two steak tacos, with a side of chips and guac, and a bottomless soda will run you around $14. Ridiculous on the street, where tacos are king, but reasonable in a concourse that's flooded with stupid expensive, mediocre options.

The steak is sitting is a brine-laden warming tray, so it's hot and moist. Your choice of toppings - including guac! - are mostly veg and salsas of varying heat. Nothing wilty, gritty or wonky; the 'cado dip needed salt and acid. If you go soft shell on the tacos, eat quickly - single torts will disintegrate post-haste. The chips are warm and non-greasy.

I'm not doing backflips over Salsarita's, but I'm not doubled over a Term E stall - so it's a win (enough) for me.),(The gal I dealt with glared at me.

My bf and I were laying over at the Charlotte airport and were hungry.  Thanks to the Yelp mobile application for the Blackberry, we actually found reviews for another Salsarita's location - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/salsaritas-fresh-cantina-charlotte-5

Based on that, we decided to head over to the main terminal.  As the reviews described on the link above, it is very similar to Qdoba or Chipotle for those that aren't familiar.  I'm happy to report that unlike Chipotle, Salsarita's doesn't charge extra for Guacamole.  Woot.

My bf ordered a salad bowl and I ordered a burrito.  Both were pretty fresh (considering that we were at the airport).  Another added benefit is that it passed the ""eyeball"" test.  We saw some pilots lining up... and that's got to be a good thing (considering that they are probably at the airport very often).

Overall, the ingredients were pretty fresh and not loaded with salt.  Woot!),(The correct name of this business is ""Salsarita's Express,"" (see the attached pic).

Salsarita's Express is located in the Atrium area of Charlotte Douglas International Airport - almost a food court feel to the area.

We stopped in here for a quick bite during a layover. I ordered the grilled chicken salad - with corn, red onions, black beans, and jalapeños. Probably one of the healthier dinner options available compared to all of the fast food. Overall, a fair salad - nothing about it would make you say ""Wow."" But it was filling.

Of course you can get more traditional psuedo Mex fare here as well: Burritos, Tacos, and such.)"

Doing our normal Saturday routine and scouring Yelp for lunch options. Very happy to find Viet-Thai at the top of our nearby options!

This little place is tucked discretely in the McMullen Creek Shopping Center. If you are entering from Johnston, it's caddy corner from Lowe's and near Curves. Better to enter from Johnston than 51. You'll see it much better upon entering. 

The menu is ENORMOUS. Much like other Thai\/vietnamese restaurants in town there are so many options. We started out with bubble tea! So happy that there is a place to grab bubble tea in south Charlotte. We tried mango and taro. Both delicious and refreshing. $0.50 extra for tapioca pearls. Kind of a bummer but not enough to stop us!

The summer rolls are perfect. Got both tofu and shrimp. Packed full of vermicelli, cilantro, carrots and lettuce. The peanut sauce accompaniment is very welcoming. I recommend adding a little sriracha to the mix. Your taste buds will thank you later. Freshness beyond comparison. 

My wife got vegetarian pad Thai. Sweet, smoky and well-balanced. A rather generous portion, to boot. Choc a bloc filled with bamboo shoots. This dish would be perfect with an added protein is just fine sans. 

I tried the #83 (the name escapes me) with medium spicy sauce. You can ask for Thai spicy, but beware Viet-Thai lovers. It's a force to be reckoned with. My entree was filled with sweet sautéed green and red peppers, onions and wide cut rice noodles. Matched with chicken and a sweet soy base. Compounding spice factor throughout my enjoyment and, boy, was it intense! I couldn't imagine any spicier. They serve your entree with ornate chopsticks, as well. Perfect for you noodle-goers. Loved every bite and intermittently sipped bubble tea and water to ward off the capsaicin onslaught!

Viet-Thai is absolutely wonderful. The staff is friendly and rather helpful with the menu. 

Prices are very fair for lunch. We ended up with a $38 bill after all of the above. Could be much cheaper, too! No complaints. 

If you like Thai, Vietnamese or Mào cuisine, this should be bookmarked for you to try asap!

Solid 4.5 of 5!),(Viet Thai is located on the side of the mall closest to Lowes. It's a dimly lit restaurant that honestly looks really shady, but its in a strip mall with a parking lot. When I walked in, it was also pretty quiet and there was plenty of tables and booths open.

Surprisingly, this is probably as good as it gets in Charlotte for both Vietnamese and Thai food! Who woulda guessed, right? I had my doubts, as a place claiming to serve both Vietnamese and Thai food which are extremely different types of food. I think the owners are Vietnamese, but contrary to most others, they are extremely nice. When they added peanuts to the Pad Thai I ordered with NO PEANUTS, they remade it without any complaints.

Spring Rolls - Would get again. They are HUGE!

The Pad Thai is DELISH and comes in hearty portions. The noodles and the flavor and sauce are all right on point. Perfectly cooked every single time! Note: if you like spicy, ask for it extra spicy because ""mild"" is so mild that you can't taste the spice.

The Pho Ga (Chicken) is also really good and has a tasty broth. The large\/small didn't seem much different in size (stick with the small).

The Pad See Ew - I've had better noodles, I like them more delicate.

Pad Kee Mao - The mild was SO spicy! They use the same noodles as the Pad See Ew, and Lard Na. It was alright but I think one order isn't enough to fill me up. Needs more noodles.

Bun Bo Hue - Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. I liked that they were really generous with the meat. But like the Pad See Ew, there weren't enough noodles. The noodles were really interesting, most people use pho noodles, but these were white round rice noodles, kinda chewy and bouncy. Would return for this when I'm craving beef.

Black Milk Tea with Boba - SKIP! Tastes like soap, probably because they use jasmine tea or something. The bubble drinks here are made with powder, so I would not recommend the fruit ones.

Vietnamese Iced Coffee - SO GOOD. and they give you alot too!),(When Viet Thai first opened many moons ago, we went barreling in  one evening and what I remember was it being newly painted, sparse and no alcohol license yet.  So a group of eight, turned around to leave, my mom tells the man, ""we come back when you have alcohol.""  I thought good lord, let me get this woman out of here!

I decided to give it a try yesterday, it looked totally different from my first visit. The two people were working were pleasant and efficient.  I ordered fresh rolls and vermicelli with pork.  There is something very addictive in Vietnamese food, maybe it's the cilantro and mint or the fish sauce, but you can bet, I want to eat there again today.

And yes, mama, they do have alcohol, it's safe to return.)"

Enso has a great vibe. A little dark, draped from head to toe and decked out in Japanese decor. Apropos for a fancy Uptown affair. I love the bar. Accessible from all sides and just as comfy as the tables or lounge. 

I've been here several times and have always enjoyed the menu. Though expensive, there are menu items that you simply cannot pass up:

The ginger salad, though ubiquitous to every sushi joint on the planet, is one of the better I've had in town. Their ginger dressing is creamy and not overpowering. 

Rock Shrimp. These little neon orange morsels of shrimp and delectable, sweet sauce might as well be made of solid gold. Lightly battered and perfect to share with the table. If you're feeling ambitiously appetizer-y, order a larger order for an entree. 

007 Roll. I don't even know where to begin. Tempura, crab on top and a balance of veggies and other wondrous sushi accoutrement. 

The service is top and the atmosphere is easy. Can't go wrong for lunch when in Uptown. This place can get slammed for dinner, so make a reservation or dip in for an earlier seating. 

Thanks, Enso! Love your sushi and all things related!),(A really good sushi addition to Uptown. Let's be honest, yes - Enso is expensive, but really, you would be a little concerned if it wasn't expensive. The fish is really fresh and their hot items are also very good. The Rock Shrimp is delicious, even if it's ridiculously unhealthy. The yellowtail hamachi and maki rolls are very, very good. Be sure to check out their special house rolls, too. My only gripe is that almost every roll was ""oversauced"". 

As for the interior - it's laid out nicely with a very large circular bar in the back. Delicious cocktails.),(Pretty good. Scratch that, the sushi's legit and the atmospheres nice.

Pretty expensive. Scratch that... it is *really* expensive. I'm going to KO next time.

Note: if you're going to come here, get the Fire Roll.),(Why do I keep coming here?????

I've upped the Stars to 2 as they do have great food.......but that is about it.  The 007 and Surf & Turf rolls were really good, but I continue to find staff disconnected from customers.   Having to ask for silverware....then soy sauce just erks me.  Add in the 2 nice glasses of wine and I wonder why I'm dropping $50 for dinner with these folks if I have to wait around for everything or ask for it.

Come to think of it.......I don't.  I think I'm going to give my business to other Sushi places in town from now on.  I just cannot in good conscious throw money at these folks and management just doesn't see these issues...or perhaps Location, Location, Location affords them that luxury?  Oh well, good luck Enso.....just not with my hard earned scratch.

Ciao!),(I think this is my favorite sushi in Charlotte..I am hesitant to say that for sure but, everything I order off the sushi menu here I love. Plus there happy hour is awesome as well.  The drinks are a little light and small but the food is amazing and only $5 for gyoza, skewers, etc.  The inside decor is luxurious and exotic but being a people watcher I love it outside.  This is definitley a great addition the Epicenter fare.),(As a city girl, I was so happy to find a restaurant with great atmosphere and healthy options in Charlotte. 

The pros:
-Can get brown rice with any sushi
-The Ginger salad is very good
-They have a variety of ""white people"" sushi rolls with all kinds of sauces and junk in edition to sashimi for those that prefer the basics so there's something for everyone
-Good atmosphere with plenty of room at the bar 

The Cons:
-The Nigori saki is $9 a glass wtf. As a sushi restaurant, you should have a house version of this, as a saki sized glass is 3 sips, which is fine, but it should be less expensive, or you should offer a smaller bottle at a reasonable price (not $42). Holy crap. Maybe I'm spoiled in LA, but dang! No thanks. Disappointed. Please rectify this. 
-No Red Snapper sushi or sashimi
-Bar service could be a little more attentive, as I asked for water 3 times while eating dinner, since I can't wash down my food with 1oz of saki, this needs to happen faster
-My best friend's ex-husband goes on dates here (kidding! this has no effect on my review, as a matter of fact it provided the entertainment for the evening)

Good job, guys, just please acquire a more affordable Nigori option so I can continue to eat here when I come to visit my friend. This should not be 5 times more expensive than the same thing in Beverly Hills. I look forward to coming back and updating my review feeling happier about my saki purchase!)"

My order: cheeseburger, chili dog and onion rings. Hey, I'm getting my wisdom teeth out in the AM and I am in the middle of a 30 day challenge at my gym. Trust me, I deserved all of that. And yes, I did eat it all.

The onion rings... oh dear God. Tremendous. The burger was okay. The chili dog was great. I really liked the flavor of the chili. Dirt cheap. I think I spent around seven bucks.

I waited all of about five minutes for my food. The super sweet woman at the counter wished me luck on my wisdom teeth.

My one regret is that as I was walking out I noticed a couple sitting outside with drinks. I did not realize they have the good ice! You know what I'm talking about... the crushed up kind. It should be mandatory for all restaurants to have the good ice.

Thank you Zach's for a tremendous last meal before I go to the dentist. There's a reason the place is always packed. Keep doing what you're doing!),(There's nothing flashy, trendy, or even remarkable about Zack's. They don't throw any fancy slogans out or use some sort of dated jargon to describe their outfit. It's just burgers, fries, rings, shakes, and the best crushed ice in all of the Earth's history. 

The Zack's Special -- Double cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, mustard, easy like a Sunday morning bun. It's like the king of all lunchroom burgers. Nothing that's going to blow you away, but familiar like an old friend. Just right. 

Fries are nothing to shake a stick at. 

Onion rings, however? Sheer greatness. 

Also, for the price of $10 for two, you can't really be upset. I'm glad that Zack's is around and has been doing the same thing for so long. Don't change a thing, fellas.)"

Since I don't spend hours every week learning about wine, I frankly don't have the vocabulary or insight to know what I'm looking for all the time. But both Mark & Dylan at Petit Philippe are there to remedy that issue. Their laid back and friendly demeanors pair perfectly with their intense knowledge of wine. Plus, they specialize in bringing in smaller scale wines that you'll probably not find elsewhere. Price wise, you'll find a nice range here - from affordable to supreme. 

And, the chocolate, oh my oh my. Listen, Casey creates all of them in house, so they aren't cheap ($2\/each). You get what you pay for, guys, these chocolates are so special.

The counter is pretty much reserved for the chocolates and are presented in the most inviting manner.

I discussed wines and selected a glass to try along with a few chocolates.  The wine was $8 and chocolates were $1 each.  

The staff was very engaging and answered all my questions.  They engaged in some great conversation making my experience here something of a treat.

With a small side of curly fries (they don't have those at McDonald's!), I decided to sit inside and people watch for a bit.

So how was it? Looking little like the picture on the menu board, but still a decent fast food sandwich. The cheese wasn't melted. The fries weren't hot. The soda fountain area was untidy. One of the napkin dispensers was empty. But the staff was nice enough when she brought my tray to my table. So that saves Jack from a one star.

Have dined here many times heading to the airport with a bit of time on my hands. Biggest complaint was lack of service, particularly if I was pressed for time.

Things have changed and I suspect new management. 

Coming back from a long Thanksgiving Weekend in Marietta GA, we decided to grab a quick lunch before getting home.  My wife likes Cracker Barrel and it was with some reluctance that I agreed. Reluctance was from issues noted above.

We arrived a few minutes before 11am and the lot was packed.  I'm recovering from a hip injury so my wife left me off a the front door while she parked the car.  Walked in and put my name on the list and was told it would be about 10-15 minutes to which I said fine.

Went back outside and sat down in one of the rockers when my wife came up, I gave her the time estimate and she went inside to brouse and shop. No sooner that this had occurred than they called our name.  5 minutes at most.

From there, the service continued throughout our visit.  Watching tte dynamics, even the manager would jump in and bus tables to keep it moving.

My wife ordered the Roast Beef Dinner with Mashed Potatoes and Fried Okra. The Roast Beef is one of her favorites because it reminds here of the Roast Beef  her Mother used to make.

I had the Chicken Dinner which was two boneless Fried Chicken Breast with sides of Fried Okra and French Fries.  The Chicken was excellent as was the Fried Okra but the French Fries were raw in the middle.

Still on average, plentiful portions and except for the Fries, well prepared and tasty.

Big improvement and just off I-85 on the North side of Exit 33.),(As we travel, Cracker Barrel is one of our ""go to"" places to stop at. We know the menu, it's reliable, and my wife loves to shop and look at all the cool merchandise in the store.

I'm a fan of ice cream shops that actually make their own ice cream versus places that order in bulk ice cream from somewhere else.  Seems like Elizabeth Creamery makes their own ice cream - you can kind of tell just by looking at their ice cream and containers.

They allow you to sample up to 3 flavors.  I tried the grape (which tasted exactly as I thought it would) and the cake batter... eventually went with a single scoop on a regular cone (wish they had sugar cones) of the cake batter ice cream, which was pretty much like a birthday cake ice cream without the frosting swirls, but with plenty of sprinkles!  The ice cream was soft and smooth and tasted exactly like cake.  It was a bit more on the soft\/melty side than I'm used to, but I'm glad it wasn't icy.  The cone was the basic kind of cone that had no flavor - wish I would have noticed that they also have waffle cones.

First,  the menu I had actually had a different printed price for the same item as another menu at the table.   Ok, easy fix.  Second, my friend was shocked  that  bread service is not free...yes, you must pay for bread up front.  We did order the bread and cheese fondue, but they bring you out a huge bowl of cheese but like only  5 small pieces of toasted sour dough baguettes.  Third, my 6 oz filet midnon was ok but for its price I've absolutely had better.   Ruths Chris is still my fav with its 500 degree plates.  My filet was ok taste wise but horrible temp wise, it was BARELY warm.  Fourth, my friend had the chicken which was 24 on his menu but 26 on mine, and it was an extremely small portion plus none of the vegetables that came with the chicken were cooked properly.  I tried a piece of the onions and it was raw\/crunchy and burned to swallow as a result.  I did say though that the flavor was good.  My friend being a former restaurant manager was appalled.   He had no forgiveness for not knowing how to properly saute onions etc.  Same with the carrot, he could barely stab it with his fork.  Fifth and finally,  the presentation lacked; my filet came out on a big plate with a burnt  roasted half garlic bulb and 3 sauces.  Just would expect better given the price point.  Given how expensive this place is, I am not sure if we'll go again till I read some reviews that show improvement.   This side of town can use restaurants like this to provide upscale dining experiences without having to go to the Southpark area, and I hope they turn it around.)"

Now, I'm not one to solely go on convenience, but that's like shooting fish in a barrel for those who are chocoholics. I stopped by the grocery store to pick up a few things this week and decided to drop in for an assortment. 

It's a somewhat dull shop with some examples of boxed arrangements, an ice cream cooler with several flavors, and the case of truffles, clusters, bark, and other things. There's a decent variety that is a bit more manageable than that of other shop's astronomic selection. I'm not sure they make the chocolates at this location, but rather the location that IS located in Davidson. Not sure. 

I picked from the case a menagerie for good measure of taste -- hazelnut, strawberry cheesecake, Irish cream, chili, vino rosso, curry, dark bark, walnut and cashew clusters, and a white peanut butter cup. Total was about $14, which is seems about the going rate for hand-crafted chocolates. The nice woman was even nice enough to put them in a box, with a yellow bow for my wife, nonetheless. Nice touch!

The chocolates themselves were decent. I really enjoyed the white chocolate peanut butter cup, curry chocolate, and the Irish Cream. The dark bark was very smooth as well. However, the clusters tasted pretty stale and boring, hazelnut tasted ALL wrong, and the vino rosso's texture was pretty blah. Not a dealbreaker, but perhaps there is room for improvement? Think they just needed a little bit more love. 

Having this place in the neighborhood is rather nice. I can see us stopping in for different varieties or seasonals throughout the year. Cheers!),(Put me in a local chocolate shop and there's a really, really good chance I'll be pleased. The new Kenilworth Commons neighbor, Davidson Chocolate Co., did not disappoint this chocoholic in the least! 

It's a teeny little shop, but Davidson Chocolate Co. packs a punch. You'll see a nice variety of chocolates: truffles of all different flavors, turtles, coconut clusters, toffee, etc. Their truffle selection is pretty impressive, offering flavors such as Kahlua, strawberry cheesecake, key lime, peanut butter and, of course, dark and milk chocolate. The treats themselves are just delightful - I especially recommend the toffee. Delish!

You'll also find ice cream and a smattering of chocolately gifty items like chocolate pops on a stick, Molly cards, etc. As Todd W. put it, these treats aren't super cheap, but the quality is there and I know I'll be back to try more.)"

Nothing seems new - staff were not friendly at all and if you are going to charge me that much for a cup of coffee - you are going to have to up your game!),(This review is for the Starbucks kiosk located between Terminals B and C, directly across from the TSA security checkpoint at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.  We quickly stopped by this Starbucks a couple weeks ago and ordered two venti iced green tea lattes with 2% milk.  They were $3.30 each plus a $0.75 syrup fee.

In general, iced green tea lattes aren't beverages that are commonly ordered at Starbucks stores, especially because it's typically not listed on the menu.  However, most Starbucks outlets are equipped with the matcha green tea powder needed in order to make the drink.

It's interesting to see how different baristas prepare the green tea lattes.  We've run into several instances where it was the barista's first time.  Willard mixed ours and he did a fine job.  He vigorously shook the powder, milk, and syrup (instead of stirring) so the drink was smooth and sweet.  The drink wasn't chalky nor powdery.  Service was lightning quick.  It helped that the kiosk wasn't busy at the time.

Overall, my experience at this Starbucks was A-OK.),(Great experience, no line, fast service, smiling faces.

I feel all these criterions are controllable by the corporation, the franchise owner or store manager.

And I can see why those places were closed, as there was very little going on today. We were one of only three tables occupied the whole time we were eating our late lunch.

We opted to skip an appetizer and enjoyed the tasty bread while we waited for lunch to arrive. It didn't take long. My wife had the French Dip which had a nice big bowl of jus for dipping. I had a standard cheeseburger (I think the waiter misheard me as I wanted the blue cheese burger, but it worked out okay). Both came with awesome fries that were perfect. I mean, really, really perfect fries.

Nice comfortable restaurant. Enjoyable.),(It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short. 

I enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it. 

While the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead. 

I think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!),(I've been here twice with close friends for dinner and drinks. I'm a fan. At both visits, the waitstaff has been tremendous. On my first visit, we tried basically every appetizer on the menu. The wings, sliders, nachos and coconut shrimp were all pretty good. The fried chicken salad was enormous and very tasty. The chicken was great and the mixed greens were fresh. The bar is nicely stocked with a wide variety of liquor at various price points, and it looks cool too. Price for food is reasonable and they email you with discounts from time to time. They even have live music on the patio sometimes. It's pretty cool. If I could change something, I would have liked more variety as far as beers go, but overall I like it and would recommend it.)"

Finally, this past weekend, I was driving on Monroe, and noticed the little drive-up grocery close to the intersection of Monroe and Sardis. Such a quaint little place with two sides to drive up to. 

I was so intrigued and a little baffled by the size. When I had read that it was a ""grocery"" store, I had a completely different image in my mind. They carry all of the wine and beer that you'll need. Cold drinks, chips, other snack accoutrement, and vittles aplenty. More of a drive-up convenience store with a bit more stock. 

Despite the mismatch in expectation, I was thrilled by the experience. There we sat in the car and the ever so friendly employee came out and asked us what we'd like. She gave us the whole spiel about how they had breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ended up with a rotisserie chicken and two sides. For the price, it was a rather forgettable meal. The chicken was pretty dry and lacked the Italian flavor it claimed to have. The collards were pretty bland and needed some serious love and the mac n' cheese was pretty standard. All for around $19 with two drinks. 

Though the food wasn't stellar, I think Swiss Farms is great for afterthought groceries. You may forget a few things at HT and on the way home need a bottle of wine for the dinner you're attending. A nice little joint. Only location in Charlotte, though.

Very large restaurant with a lot of seating, look out for the hidden stairs that seem to be everywhere. I'm not sure why they decided to add that little complication, but they did. Really handy when you're carrying a plate of food and a bowl of soup.

Sushi, always my first stop, was fresh. One area of rolls and another of fish, it was being made right there and there was plenty of it. Eel, salmon, tuna, plus sashimi in some sort of sauce. Not a very wide variety, I'm afraid. The holder with hand rolls only had one eel the whole time I was there.

There's a soup bar (I think that's what it was) where you can have the chef add your stuff to it and he cooks it up right there. There's also a grill nearby which is turning out fresh dumplings and grilled tofu and some other stuff.

The steam tables were always stocked and not just with the Americanized Chinese food. There were quite a few more authentic options, including some strange looking cuts of beef and chicken that I've not seen elsewhere in Charlotte. And the usual Pork Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and the Crawfish that everyone seems to like (though I don't!). Of course, french fries and fried potatoes and cheese sticks and even tacos!

Lots of wait staff, so drinks are always refilled and dirty plates are picked up quickly.

Would I come here again? Maybe on the weekend when I am willing to wait. The non-crab legs hours seem to be a lot less expensive.),(A friend of ours introduced us to Tin Tin last summer and we've been a few times (most recently yesterday). We were appropriately prepped about the long lines and have only been to Tin Tin on weekends for dinner right as it opens. And other than Rusan's I haven't been to any other buffets in Charlotte, so I don't have much to compare it to. 

The selections are pretty standard Chinese buffet selections. Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright. 

The service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me. 

I did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more ""fusiony"" dishes. I did get to sample a little of that, and they did not disappoint. 

Overall we're pretty satisfied with Tin Tin. Again, we're not big on buffets in general, but when we're in the mood for crab legs and shrimp this is our place. And it's great because the standard buffet selections look pretty good too. Variety is good. I'd recommend it here.)"

For barbecue, my friend had the four meat sampler and enjoyed it. He said that the sausage was particularly tasty. I had the pulled pork, with mac & cheese. It did not need any extra sauce. The pork was chopped fine, which made it a little mushy. Next time, I'll go for the sliced brisket perhaps.

I don't ever order pulled pork anywhere I go, so for me my go to proteins are the ribs and brisket. I just had burnt ends for the first time last week and they were fabulous. This is going to sound random, but the grilled cheese is great here as well. 

Pretty good beer selection. You can also order online for pickup. Parking is not great, but there is a lot behind the building as well. Just pay attention to the signs.),(Can't believe I'm just now reviewing Midwood Smokehouse. Having BBQ aplenty in Crown Town, you've got competing businesses who want that coveted, smoky place on your palate. I'm happy to say that Scibelli has done it yet again!

The locale on Central Ave is a bit tricky for parking. Pulling into the compact lot amongst other cars whizzing by on their way to Uptown can be a bit of a hassle, but it's all worth the struggle. Parking on the street is available, too. Be mindful of your space. Be sure you don't inhabit private spaces or any of the adjacent businesses lots as it my result in towing. 

Venture in to the cozy dining room, patio or rooftop and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. I can barely muster enough words to describe their culinary beauty. Smokey, cheesy, spicy, bacon-y glory. If you're sitting at a table amongst bacon lovers, more than one order will be required. They go fast. 

If you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Superbird is wonderful. Smoked turkey, ham, bacon, avocado mayo, tomato on a texas toast. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. 

The brisket is great. You can order a lean plate, if you're not wanting the fattier, yet more tasy, cut. 

The sides are where it hits home. Creamed corn that is out of this world. Spot on mac n' cheese, greens like mama used to make and smoked veggies. You can even order 4 as a meal for $9!

Do yourself a favor and order hush puppies, too. Fantastic flavor and crunchy texture paired with their tangy BBQ sauce. 

The service is splendid. Friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great job to our server Ben!

Look forward to each visit. These guys are making a name for BBQ in Plaza! Cheers!),(I had a good experience at Midwood I just wasn't all that crazy about the food. It was good just not great. The menu was enticing and I'd like to come back and try a few other items.  I liked the atmosphere and the service was good - I snagged a picnic table outside and really enjoyed my dollar beers. 

The queso was ok a little heavy but comes in a large portion and could feed quite a few people.),(4.5 stars rounded up for good service and a great atmosphere and THE AMAZING PECAN COBBLER.

I've heard much about Carolina BBQ and it's goodness, so I decided to pick what seemed like one of the best BBQ joints in Charlotte.  I'm not a BBQ snob by any means, but I've had my fair share of the stuff and am a Southern Belle originally, if you may - I know good BBQ when I taste it.

Service here was great - our waiter was helpful, extremely patient with us waiting for our 3rd person, and very friendly.  Great show of true Southern hospitality.

We opted out of ordering appetizers, since the one we were going to order (bacon wrapped jalapenos) was a choice for a side dish.

The 3 of us ""pigged out"" with the pig out combo platter and doubled (actually, paid extra and tripled) on the ribs and got double brisket.  The ribs were delicious and I loved it with the habanero BBQ - love the heat, which isn't too much.  The brisket, however, was lacking for me.  It wasn't the best brisket I've had and it wasn't as juicy as I've had other places.  They have choices of lean, fatty, or both.

As for the sides, the mac and cheese was heavenly.  Not way too cheesy and just the right amount.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos reminded me of jalapeno poppers, but not frozen, and seems like they are made fresh.  A little too much bacon for me though (I know right, too much bacon said nobody ever).  The cole slaw (regular flavor) was refreshing.  Bottom line - get the mac and cheese!

Now the dessert was THE STAR OF THE SHOW.  The pecan cobbler, which is basically like a MASSIVE piece of pecan pie without the crust nobody likes to eat, is probably one of the pecan-pie-anythings I've ever had.  You MUST get the vanilla ice cream on top for an over-the-top overly-sweet indulgent dessert and you must NOT think about the calories.  My friend and I shared it and didn't think we would finish it, but after the first bite there was no stopping us.  I love love love loved the filling of the pie - perfect consistency.  I will definitely come back just for this.

Great choice for BBQ in an area close to Uptown.),(Well, color me impressed. Midwood Smokehouse was really, really good! It's sitting at a 4.5 stars for me right now, but I imagine it will jump to 5 in no time. 

Not that I'm surprised, frankly...because Frank Scibelli seems to have the magical touch when it comes to delicious and well-formulated restos in Charlotte. It's a great location (parking can be tricky) with wonderful, friendly service and tons of tasty items on the menu. Here are just a few things I tasted...

1) Pork platter: 4.5\/5: Succulent, tender and delightful. This pork platter rivals Mac's, in my opinion. The meat is very smokey - due to the fabulous smoker they purchased for this establishment. But it's a good kind of smoke, no Liquid Smoke here. 

2) Hush puppies: 4\/5: Crispy outside, soft inside and damn good. 

3) Sweet potato fries: 3\/5: Good fries but paled in comparison to the other decadence on the table. 

4) Bacon wrapped jalapenos: 4\/5: Not nearly as hot as you'd think but a really flavorful starter. Make sure you eat one that has the bacon all crisped up. No one wants sad, soggy bacon.

5) Queso with barbecue: 4\/5: Um, I love queso. I also love pork barbecue. Put them both together and voila! Instant amazing app. 

6) Banana pudding: 5\/5: Hell to the yeah. Homemade deliciousness. With vanilla wafers. This is the real deal and you must order it. I don't care how full you are. 

I have a big ole smokey crush on Midwood Smokehouse. Looking forward to going back and checking out the patio!),(When President Obama and Hillary Clinton made a a pit stop at Midwood Smokehouse, then it must be the one spot everyone may agree on. So when I had the chance to be in Charlotte, BBQ is what was for dinner. Who would want to miss out on this. 

I sat at the bar and ordered the large Beef Brisket plate with two sides (Classic Mac & Cheese and Smoked Veggies) with hushpuppies & pickled onions.  Oh my Goodness. Very delicious and generous North Carolina barbecue for for under $20. 

A meal at Midwood will never fill you with regret. 
Five Yelps),(Down home Carolina BBQ! 
Carolina BBQ means pork. Pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce. 
I'm a Texan, and I appreciate good BBQ. I seek it out. That's why I was so pleased to try Midwood Smokehouse. I was fairly clueless about Carolina style BBQ, and was excited when the waitress knew exactly what I should have when I said I wanted local style BBQ. They served me up two heaping spoonfuls of pulled pork, topped with onions, a side of hushpuppies, and bacon-wrapped jalapenos. 
The bbq sauce was vinegar based, with spices and peppers sloshing around the bottom of the mix. I've never quite understood vinegar based sauces, but enjoyed the pickled pepper flavors  when mixed with the pork. Parts of the pulled pork had that char on it, or bark, which gave some pieces a smoky, crunchy quality. 
The hushpuppies seemed like deep fried pieces of cornbread. They had a slight sweetness to the cornbread. Decent. 
I wasn't wild about the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Being from San Antonio, we know our jalapenos, and these weren't the most primo peppers. On the small side, and overcooked so that they squish when you bite 'em.
I was blown away by the beer list. They had a rare cask aged beer, and lots of local options for fine beer. 
Unfortunately, they were out of a lot of items, so our selections were somewhat hampered. 
The service was very friendly, and they made lots of great recommendations and carefully explained a little about everything we were eating. You could tell that they take pride in the BBQ here.),(This is a must try for the Barbecue lovers in Charlotte.. I lived in Charlotte for only a few months and I came here at the recommendation of a friend. Definitely am glad that I came here. 
I remember coming here very late, must have been 10:00PM  - surprised that it was a full house. I got a pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese and it was divine. 
If you are a true barbecue lover or just in the mood for something new, you must come here! You certainly won't regret it. Enjoy!),(BBQ joints come in all sorts of technicolor glory, from the creaky houses of yore, where you leave smelling like you're wearing SIde of Beef cologne with a sprinkle of sauce for good measure, to the newer, more refined varieties, each with their own specialty, from which they dare not stray. 

These are not issues for Midwood Smokehouse, which does a variety of items on it's menu very, very well (thankyouverymuch), and they're delighted if you'd like another, come to mention it. And more of the good stuff is the attitude you'd best enter with in this wonderland of juicy cuts. At this sitting, I swooped in after the South Carolina mustard sauce with some brown sugar bacon (natch) on the back end. And if you're after some stand-up brisket, these guys do that pretty well too. 

They brought some slabs out that would stand up to the stoutest Texan brought up on beef BBQ. In all, they do a brisk biz here and I though I was a shade concerned by the corner strip center space, I needn't be. These guys had all the bases covered (except, oddly, for root beer, which may not mean much to locals but is sometimes a staple of BBQ joints I've hit. The waitress responded to its suggestion like it was a pleasant surprise). 

In the end, there was so much good stuff going down here that I couldn't tackle all of it. But these are the fun challenges you best savor again and again, like I'm sure I will.),(Midwood came highly suggested by our bartender at Birdsong, so we ventured here after a couple of beer flights! 

I ordered the Dixie Chicken Salad, and holy moly was it a HUGE amount of food. It's crammed with greens, toppings, an avocado, pulled chicken that was a little dry, and delicious chipotle ranch dressing. The BF ordered burnt ends, which comes with complimentary pickled onions (white, not red, so they weren't my fave!) and hush puppies, as well as your choice of side! He choose bacon-wrapped jalapeños per our server's suggestion, and even though they were tasty, we were only served three small pieces and it left us wanting more. Banana pudding was decent, but I'm spoiled by my favorite in Chicago. 

Overall, a total hot spot for Carolina BBQ. I'm not completely sold, but it was better than greasy food after a couple of flights.),(Some good old BBQ action.

This place has everything a BBQ place should, from the awesome menu options, to the decor, to the friendly staff.

I had the 4 meat plate with ribs, brisket, bbq chicken, pulled pork. Mac & Cheese for the side with collard greens. Yeah I was hungry, please don't judge me. All of the food was great and to my liking.  

I also had me some sweet tea whiskey to wash it all down. A bit too sweet, but who cares, I was in the moment with the BBQ anyways.),(Its been years since I've had quality BBQ and on my whirlwind business trip through North Carolina, was able to stop at Midwood for lunch.  Best stop I made on my trip.  

Found parking on the street outside and stepped inside to a casual restaurant with friendly service.  

Started off with the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  Was on a phone call, chatting away and next thing I knew, they were gone.  

And then the BBQ arrived...

Carolina Pork-Smoked, tender, flavorful and exactly what I've been missing.  I'd like to consider myself  a memphis bbq connoisseur; however, this pork was excellent in its own right.  And that vinegar sauce?  I'm not a fan of sweet sauces and their sauce's blend of vinegar and spices was a perfect pairing.  I didn't need anything else, but the goodness didn't stop there.

Creamed Corn-creamy & buttery perfection.
Hush Puppies-WHAT?!  I haven't had Hush Puppies this good since 1987 in the bootheel of Missouri.

Excellent BBQ and sides and Highly Recommend.),(I'm in South Carolina and I wanted barbecue! So I looked around and came across this place. There's nothing fancy about this place, just straight up Western ""looking"" atmosphere with lots of wood everywhere and smug paintings on the wall. Thursdays are 1\/2 off wine bottles so you know I got one of them! When I come to barbecue places or smokehouse restaurants I ALWAYS get the combo! So here I got the ""Well Fed"" portion of chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken and hickory smoked sausage. I had macaroni & cheese and steamed vegetables as my sides. Everything was amazing. Fresh, tender, full of flavor, hot and just good. I will certainly come back here to feast!)"

I've been holding off coming to this one because I didn't want to chance that it would be anything less than the perfect experience it should be. (I'm actually embarrassed that the review of the Southpark location isn't even in my first hundred reviews!) Yes, it's a chain and it's a big one, but other than the heavily laminated menus it could be a one-off. So don't worry about it.

I got here before the breakfast rush started on Saturday morning, but even without a line at the door there was still a full parking lot. (Tip for you folks with full-size Impalas or Expeditions: ""C"" means Compact. So don't park there!). An overflow lot is available across the street. I was fortunate to be seated immediately and at a comfortable booth no less. This gave me a good view of the door so that I could take up the table for a while (until the battery on my laptop ran down) but I knew when it was time to move on.

Pancakes are the main focus of the menu here, with strawberry and pecan and even bacon ones. But I decided to go with my favorite, the ""Eggs Michael."" Sort of like Eggs Benedict, this is two halves of an English muffin with poached eggs but on top of that is a delish mushroom sherry sauce. Served with four potato pancakes, it's a great treat! I've also had the Dutch Baby many times, but didn't feel like a big carb hit today.

The coffee is excellent  here and it's refilled often.

They do have free wifi (the password today was 'pancakes' but ask the staff if it isn't) and I did not see any freely accessible power outlets.

If you come here for the eggs and bacon, it's great and all that. But really, it's a pancake place. Try them, you'll like them!),(It's your sub-standard breakfast joint. Moderately busy on any given weekday, ungodly busy on Saturdays. It seems like everyone wakes up at the exact same moment and realizes they don't want know how to make pancakes in their own kitchen. 

The menu is what you've had in every other joint -- pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast, fruit, etc. One thing I do end up enjoying more than any other carb-laden item is the oatmeal. It's actually pretty good and rather hearty. 

If you're headed in for a quick breakfast\/readthrough of the paper on a weekday, you're safe. If you're coming in for a Saturday breakfast at 10am, good luck.),(I guess I could say that post op, everything taste good, but I think the food here would be good at any time.  In my still groggy state I decided on just the buttermilk pancakes and side of bacon and my wife had just hash browns and side of bacon and everything was delish (5\/5).  The service was fast and she was friendly with the obligatory ""hope you feel better"" (5\/5).  It's a cool vibe too as the building is sort of nestled off the road just a bit.  Great food and service!),(Q: Where can you find...church goers, hungover peeps, masses of kids and some of the quickest, delicious breakfast in all of Charlotte? 

A: Original Pancake House

Yup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys\/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly. 

No joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing. 

If you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!)"

I have been so excited to check this place out ever since I saw the reviews start popping up on Yelp. So when my fabulous, globe-trotting, six language speaking friend Dianne texted that she needed to be fed, I knew this was the perfect spot to bring her. 

A breakdown of our order:
Veggie Briouats- I'm not vegetarian, but we went with these as a suggestion from the guy who took our order. He was right, you won't miss the meat with this savory filling. This is an item I will definitely order every time.
Kefta Brochettes- delicious meatball-like kabobs. It comes with a harissa yogurt dipping sauce. 
Rubbed chicken and apricot- this was Dianne's entree. I loved the flavors of this. Definitely a big enough portion to share or divide up to make two meals. 
Kama veggie tajine- I had my heart set on the hearty veggie with chickpeas, but they were in the process of cooking a new batch and I was too hungry to wait. So, I went this route and ordered it over couscous. This is such a filling dish. I was stuffed less than half way through and enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will be back to get the veggie and chickpeas!

The couscous is really good by itself. They slow cook large batches daily. It has a a great flavor. Make sure you try it on its own before mixing with your entree. I know my Twitter friend Katie L. is obsessed with the falafel here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet. If you're not sure what to order, don't be afraid to ask questions. They are happy to help. As we were leaving, the guy ran outside to track us down because he found a keychain on the floor and thought we had left it. Super nice. 

Ajbani is located in the old Second Helping spot next to Three Amigos. It is primarily a take-out place, but they do have a few small tables inside and out. They also have a cooler with some beverages (water, Honest Tea). 

Kudos to the crew here for bringing an underrepresented cuisine to the Queen City. This is such a great addition to Plaza Midwood and Charlotte.)"

We were sat quickly and our server greeted us in a timely manner. She was very nice, but not efficient at her job. It was far too long between visits from her and she had to make far too many trips to the table to get anything done.

The bread they bring out before the meals is tasty and hot. It has good flavor on its own, but is even better with a little olive oil and vinegar. For my meal I ordered the Penne with Four Cheese Sauce and Meatballs. The sauce had very good flavor as did the meatballs. The pasta was a little over cooked, but not too bad.

If they can figure out the service aspect this is an ok place to eat. It took us far too long to eat with a normal size group and basic orders. The food is priced inline with what you would expect from similar joints.),(Everything was amazing (we made our own pastas) and yet the service stole the show! Terrell took amazing care of us!

Four people who didn't know each other couldn't decide on a pizza, so we let the waitress decide. She brought us a large pie (two slices each) with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.

A moment of silence, please. The good news is there's now one called the Pacific Rim (red sauce with mozzarella, ham, bacon, caramelized onions, pineapple and jalapeños). It's kind of similar and also totally delicious. Okay Mellow Mushroom, I forgive you.

I'm not a huge crust person. For me, it's just a waste of carbs. However, I will eat this crust (buttered and sprinkled with parmesan) and I don't even need anything for dipping. They use the same dough for their pretzels. Mental note to myself: order the pretzels and beer cheese next time. For the gluten free crowd, there's a ton of options for you. We took advantage of the Yelp check in (free bruschetta or hummus) and opted for the hummus (easier to share since we had a group). I would normally never think to get hummus here, but it was tasty. Christi got the Enlightened Spinach Salad which looked good. I like that they also have a build your own salad section. 

This is a great spot to hit if you work uptown or at heading to either Panthers stadium or the ballpark. If you're not already uptown, it's kind of a pain in the ass to park. You have to pay at the decks. Pro tip: check the streets around it (Poplar, etc). Meters are free after 6pm.),(Disappointing. That might not seem to be the case given the ""A-OK"" 3-star review, but we had Mellow Mushroom in Jacksonville Beach two summers ago and it was way better. So, we were disappointed. 

When we walked in, the place was clean and comfortable, but the host brought three of us (notice the number three [in written form]) to a table for two. This was despite several booths being open since it was early for lunch on a Saturday. My wife and I looked at each other in a puzzled manner and I asked for a booth. Request granted. 

We ordered and then waited about 20 minutes for our pizza. During that time, I visited the bathroom just to see how it looked. Clean. Check there. The service was also friendly, but obviously the food took a long time. 

As for the pizza itself (the most important factor), the dough is exceptionally good, but the sauce tastes like pizza sauce you would have if it a bowling alley birthday party. My wife agreed and added that it tastes like it comes from a jar. I know the sauce doesn't come from a jar (this is directed at management before they defend themselves), but it TASTES like it comes from a jar. 

I'll sum it up this way. I would assume this location attracts many drunks and stoners based on the location. Those people are going to leave higher reviews because drunks can't taste much and stoners think everything tastes great. Therefore, it's an ideal location. But to have this location and still only have a 3-star average is worrisome. 

We will try another Mellow Mushroom in the future for a tiebreaker, but it won't be this location.)"

Don't forget to grab a fortune cookie from the bowl!),(Having just moved to the neighborhood, we were in need for some good Thai food to enjoy amongst our newly inhabited home. What's the story? Fire up the Yelp app and find what's close to the homestead. Enter: Thai Thai Takeout. 

Do yourself a favor and do a thorough read-through of all of the reviews and tips before placing your order. Great Thai with several ""asterisks"" included. Here's my take: 

Was a little confused by calling in our order. They open at 5pm and I called at 5:01pm and the phone kept going to voicemail. Then, I finally entered into a phone battle with the rest of humanity who wanted Thai Thai at the same time as we did. Busy signals galore....Finally got through and placed our order with.....ease? Had to go through our order a few times but felt confident they got it down. She quoted 20 minutes. No problem, right? WRONG. Ran a few errands and then entered the waiting room of death. 

Quoted 20 minutes. Showed up 30 minutes after I placed our order, walk in....you guessed it. Food isn't ready. In fact, no one even came out front to say ""Hello! It'll just be a minute!"" There were 5 other folks in the same boat as us. Sad day for all of us Thai-loving folks. After waiting another 15-20 minutes or so in the land of Thai Thai employee desolation, a woman came up to the front and rung us up! Happy day! It was hilarious watching her pick up the phone and hang up on other folks calling in. Goes to show how busy this place really gets. Sounded like there were only two people working behind in the kitchen, too. 

So, despite the miscommunications, long....LONG wait, more waiting, and....waiting, and being misquoted on pick-up time, the food was nothing short of awesome. I ordered the Pud See Ew with shrimp. Smoky, thick noodles with a hefty portion of broccoli throughout, sriracha, and a few other veggies. It was magic. Just what was needed for a rainy day, post move in. My wife had the veggie pineapple curry. Holy cow, I wish this came in sports drink form. I'd drink from a squirt bottle! It was delicious. Creamy, mild, packed with veg. Teamed up with a nice bowl of white rice. Food was the jam and we ate it all! 

So, the lessons are: 

1- Don't believe a word of how long they say it will take.
2- Be prepared to wait even longer
3- Don't expect amazing service
4- Your food will be worth the anguish

Moral of the story: Thai Thai is wonderful.)"

It's kind of off the beaten path, but I think that's a good thing. We went to another restaurant in the area, but they were only serving a lunch buffet. We say the other spot, which was located by a man-made pond\/lake? It had paddle boats and more. The restaurant was large with plenty of seating. We elected to sit outdoors. The seating was great and plenty of shade. 

The menu was vast. I had shrimp tacos, corn on the cob and mac &cheese. I liked the corn on the cob best. The mac & cheese was just ok. I also enjoyed the tacos. Everyone seemed to like their choices. The parking options were good. You have a short walk over to the restaurant and you can take a walk around the boardwalk after to burn a few calories. The bathrooms were clean, the restaurant was spacious. Our waitress was nice, she was very helpful with menu choices. I'd visit again.),(I absolutely love Boardwalk Billy's. One of my favorite places to go whenever I am in Charlotte. The location is perfect - I usually like sitting by the windows so I can get a great view of the lake.
 
The service here is usually good, I've had a few instances where my waitress forgot about us. But it's alright because the food and atmosphere made it up for me. 

Everything I've gotten here is good, my favorite dish is the coconut shrimp. It really is unbelievable. A definite must try. The salads are delicious, as well.

If you are in the area and want to try something new, come check them out. They're a great place to come with friends and enjoy a nice night out. 

Enjoy!)"

I went with the special of the day, something to do with a fried smoked gouda and a tomato aoili on top with the regular fries and it was super tasty, held together nicely and was just a little bit drippy. The fries did not give me the impression that they were delivered by a food service truck. Random cuts and bits of tater were nice.

My only complaint is that they only offer medium and medium well. I like to be able to tasty the meat, so I'm a medium rare sort of guy. Stupid lawyers!),(So, who has Charlotte's best burger? Yeah, I'm not throwing my hat into that debate and proclaiming a winner. I will say Bang Bang Burgers is definitely in the conversation. 

This place is kind of tucked away in a little strip mall on 7th Street. The menu isn't huge, but it's still a burger lover's dream. For you non-burger folks, there are a few options for you. Key word: few (chicken sandwich, salmon blt, quinoa black bean veggie burger, and salad). I usually get a mushroom swiss burger or the bang bang burger (bangburger sauce is a must). I'm a big fan of the onion rings here. Parents, kids eat free on Tuesdays. 

I love the presentation. The burgers come out on little wood cutting boards. Local beer options. The workers are really friendly. This parking lot can get kind of crazy during the day. If you're trying to go left on 7th Street coming out of here, make sure you exit on the Pecan Street side and hit that red light. It'll save you the headache of trying to pull out into the 7th Street traffic.)"

The EpiCentre just isn't a regular ""destination"" for me as there's other stuff further away from the city that I find more convenient.

However, for folks who are in Uptown already then EpiCentre is a great place for a night's entertainment. Restaurants range from inexpensive to spendy, there is a movie theater, a bowling alley and a good few watering holes with a variety of different layouts and styles. There's even a fitness center and a tanning salon.

Because it's right next to the central bus station, there's an... interesting segment of the population here. EpiCentre does have security in the evening hours, which helps.

Parking can be expensive. Do yourself a favor and take the light rail, as it stops right at EpiCentre.),(Movies, tanning, booze, yogurt, sushi, bowling, gym. You name it... they've got it. All packed in this one place.

I could write a book about The EpiCentre, but who has time for that? I'll focus on the key things you should know. 

The parking deck: is expensive as hell. I recommend taking the light rail. It drops you off right smack dab in the middle of it. Or, park at Fitzgerald's and have a drink there first. They validate for the Wake Forest\/Holiday Inn deck right next to it. Short walk to Epi.

Best patios (in order): 
Vida- Great people watching. Plenty of room to sit, relax and enjoy the day\/evening Bubble- Directly above Vida. The patio opens up into the bar... so you can order drinks at the window without having to walk inside.
Suite- Cool VIP areas available outside. Nice to celebrate for a special occasion or a girl's night

Cool things to do:
Alive After Five: every Thursday during the Spring\/Summer months. HUGE crowd. Live music, outdoor beer and liquor stations, rooftop Pavilion bar takes credit cards. 
Strike City Mondays: All You Can Bowl for just $15 all day and all night.

Tourist-y type spots:
Whisky River: Dale Jr's bar. You can ride the bull. 
Howl At The Moon: Piano bar
Tin Roof: Live music

That's cool fact #1: former Panther Muhsin Muhammad owns a piece of Wild Wing Cafe.

Bar with the least EpiCentre feel to it: Mortimer's. Super cool spot to grab drinks.

Oh man the bars are closing and I'm hungry: Five Guys, Libretto's and Moe's all open late night

Final thoughts: there is dress code. It is enforced.),(You know, I'm not a big fan of The EpiCentre in general, but there have been a few things lately that have bumped this ""what would have been a 2-3 star"" review up to a 4. I know. Pretty ridiculous, but here's why. 

I'm not gonna touch on the ""blah blah blah bar scene, blah blah nightlife, blah blah alive after 5, blah blah clubs,"" etc. Also, why even bother with the parking situation? If you want to complain, then park elsewhere and walk. Yes, it's expensive. Correct, NO ONE validates. Big deal. What I love is to see who is moving into this space and making it have more hospitable appeal.

And soon to be more, from what I've heard

I'm excited to see this place get a little bit of a facelift from the besmirched record it has from years past. It's nice to see them motioning towards a ""family-friendly"" atmosphere and some more daytime appeal.),(The EpiCentre is great for a few things; plenty of places to eat, drink and be entertained.  These are all the great reasons you would visit the EpiCentre.  On the other hand you better be prepared for crowded bars, expensive drinks, and a whole lot of chaos.  My favorite time to visit the EpiCentre is during the day it's more chill you can sit outside, relax and enjoy some great people watching.  

I recently had a chance to check out the Biergarten at Pavilion on the top floor of the EpiCentre.  The place was dead when I was there I was 1 of 4 customers there but I liked the atmosphere and they had a good selection of beers on tap.  

If your looking for a place to entertain some out of town guests the EpiCentre has plenty to offer.),(The EpiCentre...the center of tons o' commerce, boatloads of people, and many a frat boy also plays host to some real gems. 

If you don't like tourists, crowds or popped collars, you may tremble at the thought of EpiCentre on a Thurs-Sat evening. However, take a little time and explore the place when it's not a mass of people and you may grow to appreciate it. Allow me to break it down for you...

The Great: The place is kept up extraordinarily well from the ongoing maintenance and, I assume, a great cleaning crew. Some of my fave non chain places here to hit up when EpiCentre is not overflowing with people: Mortimer's: Catch a bite and a game, Revolution: Cute clothes and shoes, Strike City: Watching any Big 10 game and bowl on someone else's dime, Biergarten: Casual place with long tables with solid beer, Vida Cantina: Guacamole. Done, Mez: Great movie theater when you don't want to deal with lines and such, Libretto's: Tasty quick slice of 'za.

The Suckage: Parking. Sucks. The only two places (that I've found) that validate are Mez (if you go to a movie and even then it's a limited amount of time) and First Physicians. Yup, that's it. So, be prepared to either pay the automatic meter or shell out cash during for an evening parking job. And frankly, these parking attendants have been total ass bags to me in the past...but whatever. And as mentioned previously...The EpiCentre can be quite young and really touristy. 

While Epi brings in about needed traffic and dollars to Uptown, you just have to plan accordingly to avoid the occasional rage of 22 year old frat boys and drunkies.),(More of a Portal to Food and Entertainment that a Destination in of itself.

Back in the 1970's, this was the site of the Civic Center which was interesting architecture but not the most user friendly place.  I even went downtown for the implosion when the brought the place down.

The plans that emerged for the place was an entertainment venue at the bottom topped by a high rise luxury hotel. The first part was built but then the crash of 2007 and 2008 hit and financing dried up. The high rise hotel part was never built although a luxury boutique did finally emerge.

There are over 24 restaurants here and by the time you add in the bars and nightclubs and a couple of retail stores, you have somewhere on the plus side of 40 places to explore.

A number of good places to dine ranging from national chains to an upscale Steakhouse is located here.  A number of excellent nightclub, some with live entertainment also find a home here.  Can't find what you are looking for, you can also catch a movie or go bowling as well.

All of these can be found here plus more.),(Living down town, this combination of eateries, movies, bowling, shopping, dancing, and dining along with live music in the summer is what every downtown needs.  Add in a huge sport venue a block away and it cannot be beat.

Being a resident it is my go to place that I can walk too........and walk home from......let me repeat that for all you folks that take cabs back to whereever and drive after hitting the bars......it is my go to place that I can walk too........and walk home from when I get my party, food, whatever on.

I don't club that much and so many other establishments are within 2 blocks there is never a situation that cannot be adjusted, changed, or improved by going somewhere else.

Great setup for great times.),(I usually love downtown spots like this, but as I get older I realize that they often house spots that are way too mainstream and overpriced.  With that said, this place SERIOUSLY reminded me of the Denver Pavilions on the 16th St. Mall.  

We happened to stop in here late on a Monday night, so our options were limited.  We ended up going to BlackFinn, which was a similar A-OK experience.  I could see how this place would be nuts on the weekend!  We only ran into one tool that night - some dude hit us up for a cab fare, and after my buddy gave him $5, he was like ""that's it?"".  Nice.  Jackass.),(Tons of restaurants from taco joints to Flemings Steakhouse, bars, cafés, a convenient CVS pharmacy, dine-in movie theater, Golds Gym, hotels, bowling alley\/pool hall, frozen yogurt and so much more. 

Easy access to the Time Warner Arena, NASCAR Museum, Mint Museum, Charlotte Convention Center, railway & bus transportation, valet parking  and so on...

If your visiting Charlotte you definitely want to explore the Epicentre for your shopping, entertainment & touristy pleasures.

Coolers of strange looking and unusual drinks. Racks of potato chips and such from far away. And two boards of specials, one of which they were out of as I got up to the register. I like that - it means that it's fresh.

I opted for a can of Dr. Browns, a bag of Route 11 chips and a sandwich they call ""Afternoon Delight"" which was a spiced turkey with cheese and avocado and tomato in a panini press. It was delicious. Super filling and tasty.

Totally would return here to Noda Bodega. Yum!),(How much do I love this place? Well, the last two times I've been here I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted, so I just ordered two lunches. I'm a problem solver. 

As much as I loved the their old, cozy location, this space is just so much better. It's bigger, there's more seating, and it's easier to park. I love the long counter. I typically do take out, but will always sit here if I'm staying.

Along with their regular menu, they always have different specials every day. Check their Facebook page, they always post them along with descriptions and pictures. Fridays they always have the G-Wich (london broil, three pepper cheese, jalapeno bacon), named in honor of my old roommate. Hi Greg. My favorite regular menu item here is the Greek salad. It's one of my favorite salads in Charlotte. I think it's the peppadew peppers that do it for me. The reuben and the Italian Stallion are both also great. I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here. Couple weeks ago, they did a chile relleno stuffed with sweet potatoes and over grits. Holy. Ridiculously delicious. They've also got a great selection of wine and beer. There's also a few drafts. 

NoDa Bodega also landed at #9 on Yelp's 2016 Top 50 Places to Eat in Charlotte list. Huge congrats to them, love seeing spots like this getting much deserved recognition. Congrats!),(Sure. The Bodega may not be on the main strip alongside the rest of the NoDa greats, but this neighborhood gem packs a walloping punch for those craving local biz feel, love, product, and aesthetic. The simple and understated.....perhaps reonvated ""house,"" takes shape as a cafe\/deli\/oddly laid out diamond in the rough. Thrilled to check it out after catching wind of the sandwich special of the day. 

We walked up and ordered the caprese sandwich and the Mr. G...or Super G...something like that. Only drawback from this visit was attention from the staff. Not a huge deal, but it was a little difficult to get a word out of them, or even get them to pay attention to the fact we were trying to order. 

The caprese was perfect. Loved the bread it was on and the mozz, basil, and balsamic were top notch. Nice touch with the tomato spread, too. The sandwich I ordered was just ridiculous. London broil, jalapeno bacon, balsamic reduction and a few other nice accoutrement to enhance texture. Needless to say, it was a mammoth sandwich. Check out my photo. Only downside was when it was all gone, haha. 

I'm very much looking forward to heading back to The Bodega. Great sandwiches and selection of other items, too. Cheers!)"

I want to like your quirky interior, semi-convenient location and extensive menu but it just isn't going to work out long term. I need more substance in my life, and I just don't think that you can provide that for me.

In all seriousness, I really wanted to give Presto a good college try. Here's the lowdown...

The Good: Extensive menu - lots of options, especially for the picky eaters out there. HUGE portions...honestly....gargantuan and therefore affordable. Free parking across the street if needed during the weekdays. 

The Meh: The food was just ok. The calamari was pretty tasty and, as mentioned before, could have easily served as an appetizer for four hungry folks. I wish it was a little crispier and had more flavor. I had the coconut shrimp which weren't bad, just a little greasy. Note, however, this meal came with eight shrimp for $12 - that's a deal. Presto reminds me a bit of a non-chain version of TGI Friday's or Applebees with their large menu, huge portions and overly sauced\/fried items. 

Overall: It's not bad by any means, I just don't have a huge desire to go running back here any time soon. Maybe if I stop by another time I'll try a salad?!)"

We've dined at the one in University City on many occasions and are fan in general but have never dined at this location.

We got there around 2:30 any lunch had already dissipated. The hostess promptly seated us and our waiter was there at our table in quick order. Introduced himself and wrote his name in crayon on the white butcher paper that covers the table. Nice touch and common to Romano's.

He gave us menu's and took our drink order. I ordered Sweeten Tea but first asked how sweet the tea actually was. He quickly went and got me a sample to try which then prompted me to order half sweet and half unsweetened to get to the proper level of sweetness.

He then proceeded to get our drinks while we studied the menu. Menu has been ungraded since the last time we dined at a Romano's with more of a lighter fare.

My wife order the Chicken Scaloppini while I order the Pork Chop in a Fig Marsala reduction along with a Caesar Salad to start.

He placed the order with the kitchen and brought us some bread and made a dipping sauce at the table. Bread was nice and hot but would have been nice if a bread knife had been provided. The knives in the table setting are not designed to cut the loaf and the loaf is coated with hot butter so very messy to pick it up and break it with one's own hands.

All in all , the bread was excellent with great taste and texture.

The Caesar on the other hand was a disappointment. Very dry and bland in both taste and texture. High point on the salad was the croutons if that says anything.

The entrees however both proved to be excellent. My wife enjoyed he Chicken and the angel hair pasta that came with it. She's had the flu for a week and this was her first time out of the house so she really appreciated the good food.

The Pork Chop was nice and thick, moist and not the least bit dry with great taste and texture. The new potatoes, zucchini, onion and other vegetable made for a nice balance.

All in all, a nice dining experience. Restaurant is nice, airy and open with a Tuscan flair. Service was very good and with the exceptions noted above, the cuisine was excellent.

We would definately go again next time we are in the area.)"

I use to live a few blocks away on Yadkin, so Smelly Cat became one of my second homes. You may have seen me riding around there as a passenger in Gman's golf cart. We are former roomies. Hi Greg.

Coffee, hot chocolate, tea... hot, cold. Whatevs. It's all fantastic. I was excited to have a meeting with Nathan B. over there today and reunite with my coffee shop. We were successfully productive despite a whole lot of eye candy visiting Smelly Cat this morning. Meow. See what I did there.

In a hurry? Grab a cup to go. Looking for a place to post up and get some work done? Make yourself at home and fire up the laptop. Make sure to snag a baked good, too. 

The workers at Smelly Cat are super friendly. They pretty much know everyone (if not actually everyone) in the 'hood. Plenty of parking in the SC lot and also on the street. Easily accessible. 

If you're in or nearby NoDa, be sure to stop by and get your caffeine fix here.),(Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat thanks for providing me with a comfy booth and tasty treats. And yes, I'm that tool who sings the Smelly Cat song in my head every single time I walk into this cute little coffee house. 

Smelly Cat is one of those adorable local coffee hangouts that is chock full of fun. They have coffee, they have ice cream, they have pastries, they have tea...I mean, comon' they even have cheesecake. The staff have always been really friendly and eager to please. Hubs and I have strolled in here a few times during Friday gallery crawls and have yet to be disappointed. 

I've enjoyed a very good, and very sweet, white mocha. No doubt it would put most folks straight into sugar shock. On another occasion I've taken down a hefty strawberry croissant. While it wasn't at the caliber of other local bakeries, it was still flaky and scrumptious. I also remember a time that I enjoyed some type of mango iced tea. Even unsweetened it was the perfect accompaniment to a sweltering summer day. 

Until next time, Smelly Cat, I'm going to try to get this song out of my head now.),(No Da at its best.  Small place, big prescences in the No Da hood.  Indoor and out door seating, plenty to eat and drink.

Parking can be a challenge, but when you want to get away from the Restaurant and bar scene in this part of town, Smelly is the way to go.

Be it coffee or tea, ice cream, or pastries, they have a little something for everyone.

During warmer months they also live music outside.  Throw in a Friday gallery art crawl and it is both a nice place to start and finish such an evening.),(The coffee shop is the only shop in town that offers their own roasting on premises. They have a giant contraption that they roast the green beans into what you're used to putting in your coffee grinder. 
The coffee was delicious, a citrus raspberry taste with a light roast. 
They also offered plenty of samples of their baked goods, which tasted amazing. I was happy to see that they offer real milk and cream, instead of the non-dairy creamer stuff. 
There were plenty of places to sit and relax, play one of their games, or read one of their books. They offered lots of free literature at the front and back of the bar. 
The staff was very welcoming and friendly, and the prices were quite reasonable for the high quality of coffees they're serving.),(There was an intermittent alternate dimension happening at Smelly Cat over the past couple of days, and it made for great people watching. Case in point: today several groups of fourth graders paraded in throughout the day to read their own poetry, open-mic style. It was quite the site to see, what with all of the rhyming prose and the enraptured listening of the teaching set, and when it was over? Snaps, just like the beats like it. Ginsberg might have been confused, but he might have been proud.

Smelly Cat Coffee House is just what the name implies, a cozy cove of fluffy chairs, enclaves, and cafe tables that make camping out here in NoDa fun. My meetings today flew by, not the least of which was because of the hazelnut Italian soda I slammed, or the arty ramblings of children, or the giant leafblower that careened about when I sat outside for a bit. It's a little on the small side, but you don't have to be gigantic to be a cool coffee room. And as it turns out, if you're here, the ability to snap effectively helps.),(I ordered a Dirty Chai here and my life has never been the same since. When I sip on my daily, straight forward and unimaginative iced coffee, distant memories of espresso, chai, almond milk and crushed ice still dance in my mind. 

The truth is, I came here for the name. And because it was literally across the street from Yelp's Summertime Soiree at the Neighborhood Theatre across the street.

But boy am I glad they came up with a quirky name to hook and line me in there to experience that Dirty and take in the sights and scents of roasting coffee.),(I will never forget you delicious iced chai! So good. 

It's a fun and quirky coffee shop, that has delicious chai, what more can you ask for? Maybe a dirty chai, with a shot of espresso?? And pumpkin rolls in June? I'm in! Although I wasn't as into the roll as much as the chai, it's still a solid shop in my book.)"

If you've been to any one of those assembly line places like Subway or Blaze or Chipotle, then you're already familiar with the basic format here at Yafo. Start with a base, add veggies, add extras, done.

But with that said, you've probably never had these sort of goodies before. I had the hummus bowl as my base, which is a massive portion (like a full cup's worth) of hummus, then added fresh tomatoes and fresh cucumber and a chickpea salad and some stewed cabbage and stewed onions and then a big scoop of feta cheese, then had it topped with pulled rotisserie chicken. And then a side (which they call a mezze) of the roasted Brussels Sprouts.

It was AMAZING. So many flavors, so many textures, so much deliciousness in every single bite. Just all full of wow.

Totally will be back to Yafo. Wow!),(My years of food adventures in Charlotte have taught me this: if Frank Scibelli is involved, it's going to be amazing, delicious, and will live up to the hype. 

Yafo Kitchen is a fast casual type concept, but way elevated. A focus on fresh, quality, and local ingredients. If you're wondering why it costs a little more than other fast casual places, this is why. It's totally worth it. I mean, they even fresh squeeze the lemon juice. Authentic, daily made from scratch bread (you can watch them make the laffa there in house), spreads, and juices (seriously, skip the sodas and pay more for one of these). And, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. They also have local beers. 

My problem is that I like everything here, so ordering is a struggle for me. I love all the sides. If I build a bowl of some sort, I end up basically adding every topping possible. The portion sizes are generous. I can usually make two meals out of a bowl. Don't be afraid to ask questions. The menu can be a little bit intimidating. Everyone here is nice and will explain it all to you. 

It can get pretty crazy here for lunch, so plan accordingly. There will be a line. It does move fairly quickly. I recommend off-peak times or ordering online for take out.)"

The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college. 

We were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick\/industrial feel inside. 

I imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!),(Let's just suppose you are not a fan of having a wide selection of Whiskey, Bourbon, and Scotch at your fingertips that is reasonably priced. Or even if you could care less about an intriguing beer menu of both local an national brands. Maybe you don't even drink alcohol! You should still go to Whiskey Warehouse. The Plaza Midwood location is a neighborhood I love because of the community and the other restaurants and bars in the area, but Whiskey is a little different. Hardwood floors, walls, tables, everything gives it a bare stripped down feeling, but if the wood looks less than comfortable that pop a squat on one of the lush overstuffed leather couches in the corner. The food is fan-freaking-tastic! Wings, ribs, steak, and even great salads and sides for my vegetarian friends. It's never really that crowded, which is perfect because it isn't really that big but somehow gives off a spacious vibe. Maybe it's the high ceilings or giant plasma tv's over the bar. Whiskey is a great place to start or end your night. They have fun events and month long drink specials! ""Home of the $4 Jack Daniels,"" is a great slogan they proudly boast, but I just love it for ambiance, selection, and general merriment.),(Above average whiskey selection! 
I was impressed how this place has ""Jack Daniels"" stamped on nearly everything. The place is a giant billboard for Tennessee whiskey. 
When we arrived, it was super loud. They had a DJ playing dance hits, with people getting out of their seats and getting rowdy with the music. The place had a definite fratty vibe. 
The whiskey selection was decent. I've seen much better lists of bourbons, and it seemed like they were mainly just picking out as many whiskeys as they could. They were missing great bourbons, but I guess it's not a bourbon warehouse, huh? 
They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5. 
The service was pretty good, our drinks never went empty, and we were checked up on regularly. 
The place is clean, and well kept. It has a classy interior, with an awesome rooftop patio! 
My favorite thing about this place was the number of televisions that they had going. They're on every surface around, each tuned to a different sporting event. This seems like a great place to catch a game!),(We really like the rooftop bar here. In a strange kind of way, they have different beer selections upstairs and downstairs, so you might have to go up and down. While we loved the open air rooftop, the downstairs is rather dark and dingy during the day.)"

And they still share the location with Bruegger's. On a weekend morning, there was quite the queue over there for bagels, but the coffee was quick and easy. And it is still pretty good coffee.

I ordered that at a different location. They offer a choice of milk chocolate, white chocolate or dark chocolate chips in your drink! I got the dark chocolate one and I thought it was quite tasty. The coffee seems pretty strong here and the prices are about what you'd pay at most chains. It's a pretty typical coffee shop.)"

Let's start with the chips and salsa. Can't.stop.eating.these.chips. What are these things laced with? I haven't had the guac here yet. Why? Because I have a massive crush on the cheese dip. Get it with onions.

I usually stuff myself full with all of the above, but somehow manage to force down some of my meal. I love the enchiladas. All of the enchiladas. Plates are huge. Huge and delicious.

Typically, I just get a water when I'm here. Hello, I need to save room for all the chips. However, on Fridays the big margaritas are on special. Who can say no to a giant margarita?! 

Yes, it's in a little shopping center on Central. Yes, all the neighboring businesses have bars on the windows. Yes, the sign on the convenience store next door reads ""Do Not Enter with Mask or Hoodie."" Don't let any of this stop you from visiting Three Amigos. Trust me, you'll thank me.),(I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint\/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. 

The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app\/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. 

The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. 

Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. 

Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were ""Dos"" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. 

Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!),(All I can say is this place deserves all of it's rave reviews.  I got a little taste awhile back at a Yelp event but I had yet to stop in for myself and experience what this place really has to offer.  

The menu is extensive and has all your traditional Mexican favorites like tacos and burritos.  DO NOT  leave this place without trying the enchiladas.  I decided on the Enchiladas Rojas I think I made an excellent decision.  Most Mexican joints I've tried in the area if I order enchiladas I get a big plate of greasy cheesy goodness with some unmemorable sauce.  Not at Three Amigos the waitress asked if I wanted my red sauce spicy (she must know me)  this was the most delicious enchilada sauce I've ever had it had a really nice kick to it.  $8.99 three huge enchiladas and after all my chips I took two enchiladas home and had dreams about them all night.  They were just as good the next day.

As you can see I highly recommend Three Amigos.),(Te amo, Three Amigos. Te amo.

I've been putting down a fair share of Mexican food as of late and I was just delighted to finally drop by Three Amigos. If you're looking for a fancy pants Mexican establishment, don't waste your time here. But if you're like me and on occasion you crave delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican fare with a low-key atmosphere, consider this as good as it gets in Charlotte.

The daily drink specials are bangin' especially $5 jumbo margaritas on Fridays. But don't worry, every other day they are only $6 each. Prepare yourself that they are delicious. And.huge. And.full.of.alcohol. The service is kind, warm and friendly. There are a handful of servers who speak enough English to effectively jot down your order and if not, well, work on your Espanol, kid.

And the food. Delicioso, compadre. I've sampled a few different things here but I really enjoy their guacamole - full of flavor and cilantro. Next time I may ask if they can make it spicy, too! Their tacos (soft corn) are tasty and, again, garnished with a smattering of spice and cilantro. The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items...perhaps mole next time?!),(Holy guacamole!  I love this restaurant, I have already written a review and proclaimed my love, but I want to spread the good word on this new name page too.

I went in last night after an afternoon at the Thirsty Beaver, it was better than normal.  I couldn't believe it, sometimes you love restaurants but it looses it's charm after a couple of visits, not this one.

I had never ordered the queso, it had sauteed onions and chorizo. I might have to get that every visit.  It's tiny, the perfect amout for two people.

Then BORING, I ordered what I always order, enchiladas verde.  I can't help myself. If you like hot stuff, call me.  no really, make sure you ask for their hot salsa, it taste like pureed hot peppers and avocado blended. It will light you up, just like the Thirsty Beaver.

Don't forget to order imported Coke with real sugar.),(11\/16\/10

Come here only for the margaritas!  And maybe the flan.  

We almost turned away, bec. Mom doesn't like ""hole in the wall"" places.  She's no food snob, but she does appreciate pretty spaces, and this place wasn't.  But we weren't here for the ambience-- we were here solely bec. a couple of my Charlotte Yelp friends recommended it!  Thank goodness my nephew was around; For some reason, he has this grounding effect on our Mom, and she rarely makes a fuss where we go, as long as he's there.  :)  (Thinking back, though, I don't think I'd like to take my nephew back to this part of town-- a bit seedy, and this was around 1p!)

First order of business: un frozen margarita ($5), por favor!  Second order of business, nos dan tortillas con salsa y guacamole (gratis), por favor!  Actually, give THEM some chips, I'll just take a few sips of the marg...  Nephew wanted a cheese quesadilla ($5.99); sis wanted a combo plate-- a chicken taco and a beef enchilada ($7.49), con arroz y frijoles refritos; and I one of those lovely-looking tortas Milanesa ($7.99) con pastor (seasoned grilled pork).  The margarita was good.  As usual, Mom and sis filled up on the free chips and salsa...  I heard that the cheese crisp was OK, too.  It was better-received than the taco\/enchilada combo.  I don't think she finished any of it!  My torta looked good, but one bite of the bread and my hopes of a fantastic sandwich thrill went south of the border!  Having looked at prior food shots from other TA reviews, I was expecting this crusty telera bread w\/ a soft interior, but no way, Jose!  No crispiness anywhere- just a soft roll.  Another proof that the photos here are deceiving (including the ones I've posted)- the meat portion was sorely lacking.  It's as if they stuff just enough meat in the center so that, when sliced, a cool food shot can be taken!  ""Donde el res?!?!""  (""Where's the beef?!?!"")

Ayayay, pero there was the yummy flan, which we all thought was pretty good, considering Mom and I make some mean flan ourselves!  Three Amigos' flan even looks like the ones our Mom used to crave for when she was pregnant w\/ me-- slightly overcooked, w\/ air pockets, and the edges crisped just so.  (Hmm... was I describing myself, or the flan?  LOL)  Well, this one had the air pockets.  The edges were of a firmer texture, and as we progressed to the center, it became slightly creamier.  

We may come back for another margarita and more flan, but not anytime soon.),(Pretty excited to have found a mexican restaurant that serves one of my favorite dishes: Alambres.  I highly recommend ordering it because they make it very well, a ton of meat (and bacon in there if i remember correctly) slathered in cheese.  The only other place I have found Alambres at was in SF so when i saw this on the menu i was elated.)"

I wasn't a fan of the veggie rolls. However, the potstickers appetizer was really good (pan fried). I got the General Tso Chicken, without the spice, since you can alway get spicy dishes without spice. It was really good!! I wish I had more rice on the side, but that is okay. The flavor was amazing!!!  

I was able to try the Chicken Lo Mein and the flavor was amazing!! To me, you never know how the Lo Mein noddles are going to be made, but the way they made their noodles were great. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in Charlotte. Highly recommend, yum!!)"

I won't bother going into the prices ($2.78 for one 20oz bottle of soda) or even factor it into the review since it's not their fault and the markups are expected - - I can certainly accept that.  What I cannot accept is employees who are not customer service oriented, unprofessional, unfriendly, and not willing to do what it takes to ensure an efficient and quality experience.  

If you're looking to buy something quickly on the run before you make your connecting flight, don't bother to stop here because the employees work at their own leisure and pace - even with the manager present.  

I walk in and see 6-7 people in line waiting to make a purchase.  There are 3 Registers and minimum of 5-6 total employees (wow, seems overstaffed).  At first glance 2 of the Registers were processing customers while the 3rd was occupied by an employee processing paperwork.  I pick up my soda (Coke Cherry Zero - - the highlight of the experience) and stand patiently in line, now Customer # 6 in queue.  Okay, I'll be patient.  

One of the employees ringing up customers then stops her work and turns around to help another employee who is asking questions and looking for something (a ""book"").  The 2nd register employee slows down her work to engage into the discussion for assistance.  The other 2 employees then walk away to go retrieve the book leaving 1 register open with a (now) queue of 10 people waiting in line.  Meanwhile the manager (I believe - male authority figure) is standing next to the register and is watching her process orders, plus the other register is still processing paperwork.  There is also another employee standing nearby and starts talking with the other two who are looking for ""the book"".  

The Math:  Out of 6 total employees 3 of them are standing around chit-chatting while 1 authority figure is observing and the other 2 are doing work where only one of those two is actually ringing up customers.  The queue is now @ 10 and I'm # 5.  Yay!!  There is no sense of priority or urgency in processing customers in a timely and efficient manner.  A few minutes later I move up to #2, and even though I'm next in line the manager proceeds to point to the girl behind me (#3) saying they will be able to ring her up on the other side (register now open - she finished her work).  The girl behind me then looks at me and says ""you're next in line so I'll wait after you...."".  Cool beans - - thank you.  She (customer) was more cognisant than all of the 6 employees combined.  

I nearly put my drink down and walked off - - why should I even give this establishment my $$ and support when they don't seem to give a rats behind about quality customer service.  If it wasn't for that damn hot sauce I just had w\/ my meal I would have done it - - I swear!  But a nice cold Coke Cherry Zero sounded so damn good at the time - - it was a thirst quencher, still not worth $2.78 but that's a whole other story. 

Like I said - - if you're in a hurry or really dislike waiting too long in lines, or don't care for low morale or poor customer service and execution then don't bother to stop in here.  Lesson's Learned = don't do anything that would provoke you to having the need to buy something here (i.e. the need to quench your burning throat w\/ a cold beverage due to excess consumption of hot sauce).

From my seat, I browsed the internet on their free wifi and noticed one burger sitting in the kitchen window. Four minutes, six minutes, eight minutes. I knew it was mine (no one had ordered after me) but at this point I simply wanted to know how long it would take for the counter guy (manager? not sure.) to quit his conversation with another patron and bring over my burger. In the end, it was the kitchen guy who did so, warning me that the plate was hot. Of course it was hot, it had been sitting under the warmer for more than nine minutes. The burger was still hot though the cheese had melted quite a bit.

Onion rings were good. Crispy outside but not too mushy inside. Dipped in the tangy sauce provided.

Dropping the ""Katz"" from the name to disassociate themselves from the original Katz Deli in New York, this is now just ""New York Deli"". Yes, they have every right to the name as the previous owner was Katz, but this just eliminates any confusion.

This is a proper New York deli with sandwiches that are more meat than bread which includes pastrami and corned beef, knishes, potato pancakes, smoked salmon and whitefish, the usual black & white cookies and of course, rugaleh pastries. There's nothing else like this in the Queen City.

Depending on mood, I might have their smoked fish platter or their Reuben. The Reuben is a ton of food and has won ""Best of Charlotte"" a couple of times. But today, it was the ""Smokey Joe"" which is a toasted everything bagel, cream cheese onions, tomato and whitefish salad with a solid portion of hand-sliced Nova salmon.

The interior is just quaint. Some NY decor, simple seating....and that's about it. The service is great. They might be from NY, but they definitely retain the Charlotte\/Southern hospitality. 

We were in the need of some serious bagel-age, and Katz has it all. Only a few choices -- poppyseed, sesame seed, plain, everything and a few others. I'm a huge fan of Lox and cream cheese on a bagel, but the owner gave me a crash course in the difference between Lox and Nova. Apparently, Lox is much saltier and Nova is basically plain, raw Salmon. He recommended Nova, so I obliged. It was fantastic. Fresh, mild and worked perfectly on the sesame bagel with cream cheese. I was a happy camper. 

It seemed a bit pricey for two bagels and a diet coke. Around $14? Wow. Have to say it was worth it, but maybe not for a daily affair. 

Can't wait to check this place out for lunch. Pastrami on rye? Yes, please.

I'll definitely be back for another bagel with Nova!),(I love this restaurant, it's authentic, it's a no frills, good food deli.

You can only get in and out from Sharon Road, so if you're on Fairview you'll want to go past, make the right before Phillips Place, and drive around to get onto Sharon, rather than try making a U-turn.

This is a take-away location only. There are no seats inside or outside. Which makes your buck and a half 20 ounce Diet Coke very expensive.

If I return, it will only be to get a great sandwich. I'll skip the ""combo"" that adds three bucks for a bag of chips and a fountain soda.),(Plain and simple, Jimmy John's really does make a mean sandwich and I appreciate their little quips in and around their stores. The brand has an irreverence that not many other brands embrace, or at least embrace well. 

This location is probably my favorite in town. There aren't any tables or seating, except a very small bar where you can stand to eat. Wolfing down a sammy and then getting on with your day is just so American, right? These guys do a great job. Every time my wife and I have visited, our order has been taken, prepared and handed to us within 3 minutes. Great for grabbing a really quick bite on the go, or to take home. 

Also, I have to sing praises of the unwich. Believe me, I love bread so much. It's the staple of the culinary world, in my opinion, but the unwich makes for something extra special. Just a tons of iceberg lettuce wrapped around whichever delectable combination you like. Perfection. So light, crunchy and easy. 

Thanks, Jimmy John's!),(If you want a solid, good flavored sandwich and you're short on time, Jimmy John's is the place to go. 

Cold cuts, cheese, fresh bread. There really aren't any gimmicks here, just fast, delicious, simple sandwiches. Great service too. I usually order the Big John or the Italian Night Club. 

This location is especially fast because there aren't any tables. You can lean against a counter and eat, but you'll have to stand. 


I hear that Jimmy Johns is slowly creeping up in the north. I'm glad to have one so close to me when I can't decide what to eat. Their sandwiches are just fine for me!

Btw, not too pricey. Friendly staff. Solid all around.)"

No matter what you call this place we can all agree on one thing: the real reason to come here is the rooftop patio. #AmIRight?! Tremendous view of our gorgeous uptown skyline. I think it beats Whisky Warehouse based just on layout and setup.

Foodwise, the menu can vary because of PR's farm to table concept. I really like that. Our latest visit here we ordered calamari. I wasn't a huge fan of the breading. A squeeze of lime drastically made this better. I ordered the watermelon feta salad. Simple, clean, fresh flavors. My friend got the chicken and waffles. Holy, it looked like an entire chicken was on the plate. A-OK is a good description for the food here. I've never had anything bad... it's just there is nothing that has been overwhelmingly impressive.

I've only been here during evening hours, so I usually park across the street at the JLC Wearhouse. (Only when it's closed of course) I don't understand the whole reverse parking thing in Plaza Midwood. You can translate as, ""I'm not very good at parking."" 

I think The Peculiar Rabbit rooftop is a great place to grab drinks and apps for a date, a night out with friends or to kick off an evening. Because of the size and all the levels, it would also work well for a group dinner.),(After hearing through the grapevine and keeping tabs on construction for this establishment, we were surprised and delighted to hear that The Peculiar Rabbit was holding a soft open this past week. Had heard that it was going to be ""Jack's Across the Tracks"" and a few other rumors that made no sense. After seeing another gastro-pub open in town, the time was ripe to check it out! Here's my take:

The exterior and general aesthetic doesn't exactly scream gastro-pub. It has taken an odd shape with some serious standout qualities. My favorite part is the giant logo literally stamped on the side of the building. Definitely makes a statement. 

The interior is very chic and a little more trendy than I anticipated. Wasn't expecting to see such a heavy bar scene. Long bar on the 1st and 2nd floors that I'm pretty sure mimic one another to a T. When it comes to a night out in Plaza, beer is always on the menu. I was pretty disappointed with the beer selection. The draught brews consisted of some NC beers, but only Copper from Olde Meck. Think it'd be nice to get some of the other local breweries on board as well. The bottle selection is decent. Had a chance to order a New Castle brew I had never had.

The menu was a bit limited due to the soft open. We stared with the twice-baked potatoes and pretzels. First, the twice-baked were pretty bland. The creme fraiche was very well executed, but the rest of the dish was forgettable. With only three tiny potatoes, I wouldn't look to order this again. The pretzels....divine. The presentation was great and the portions, hefty two-bite sized pieces, were perfectly crunchy on the exterior and chewy on the inside. The beer cheese, which seems to be rather popular as of late, is splendid. Great texture and subtle flavor. Also came with spicy stone-ground mustard.

We decided to split an entree. Went with Banh Mi. My goodness. Talk about divine. The pork was so flavorful and was reminiscent of some other great Banh Mi I've had. The veggies were fresh and complemented well. The bread, sourced local, was a nice touch. Very good stand up for that juicy which. 

The views are absolutely stunning. It was an absolutely gorgeous night and the skyline couldn't have been set more perfectly. The roof deck is by far one of the most impressive in town. I'm looking forward to dining there next time! 

One of the most admirable aspects is the farm-to-table practice. Great to see the menu littered with local sources and our server had a great knowledge of where specific items had come from. A rather important trait for a biz to have these days to stay on the radar of Charlotte's culinary-minded. 

One thing we couldn't really handle was the noise level. We were sitting across from one another and yelling to hear each others' words. Wonder if there would be an option for sound dampening on the 2nd floor? Also, the natural light that comes in with the sunset was blinding. Curtains will definitely be a must in the coming weeks. 

My biggest critique is the parking situation. Goodness gracious. Everywhere you can park around the building is permanently taken and other parking spaces around that part of plaza are marked with what seems like ""PARK HERE AND DIE"" types of signs. If they can work something out with local parking spaces after regular biz hours for surrounding businesses or look into comped valet perhaps, it would serve them well. 

I think TPR has some serious potential with that space. Their menu and beer list will definitely see some tweaking and I look forward to the result. Like many new places, there will be many changes made for flow, better service, and overall experience. I'm definitely a fan and the service and experience given to us will have us coming back in the near future. The views alone from the roof will keep us coming back on cool, clear nights!

Glad we had a chance to sample this joint so early! Welcome to the neighborhood!

Cheers.),(Whether you are sitting down for brunch, inviting business partners to lunch, or just grabbing drinks after work, you can't go wrong with this place! Great cocktails, cold beer, delicious food, friendly staff, all with an amazing view of the Charlotte skyline, just outside of uptown.

At the end, it's wrapped up and ready to go.

My chicken burrito was decently stuffed with chicken and the guacamole was a bit more loose than I prefer but still tasty. It needed hot sauce.

My review would be much higher. I could even go with four stars. The food isn't bad, especially for airport food. My burrito with chips and queso tasted just fine and hit the spot, the but customer service here it truly terrible.

While I waited for my connecting flight home, I stopped here. While I waited in line I watch the employees make fun of customers under their breath, give numerous customers attitude, and crack unnecessary jokes behind the counter. It was kind of uncomfortable to be around honestly. One employee was laughing so hard (at a customers expense) that she couldn't wait on anyone because she was buckled over from laughter.

I would have left honestly but I had already ordered to be honest I was starving. It was bad, very bad. I fly through there somewhat regularly and will never stop there again because of that.)"

I can't agree with previous reviews of the salsa. While it wasn't the way I would make it, the salsa I was served was large-ish chunks of tomato and small pieces of onion and spices. Yes, there was a good amount of water in the bottom, but the stuff above the waterline was spicy and hit the spot with the chips while I waited for my entree.

My margarita was massively huge though I'd say it probably only had one pour of tequila in it. I've never had one served with an orange and a cherry on the rim before. Weird.

The ""two enchilada combo"" also comes with a scoop of Mexican rice and a cute fried corn tortilla bowl of refried beans. It was satisfying, for being ""Americanized"" Mexican food.

Would I come here again? Sure, why not.),(After coming here for years, I was disappointed my last visit.  Don't know what has happened, but the place has really lost all that was good about the place before.

And over the course of nine years, I ate lunch here entirely too much. Why? Well, I worked two blocks from this place.

It's an old-school Italian restaurant family owned and open since 1952.  The walls are plastered with all kinds of nostalgia. One wall is covered in college flags. There is even a Nebraska one. Go Huskers! 

The lunch specials are by far the best deal here. Basically, it's a menu of things covered in cheese. They are good sized portions. The meal comes with your choice of a cup of Minestrone soup or a side salad (heads up: it's just iceberg lettuce) and a drink (tea, water or coffee). Also, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. 

I really like the chicken barcelona. Yes, it does sound like it would be a little healthier than the others. However, it seems like it's made with a lot of butter. This is one of those places where you just need to accept that you're going to consume some calories, unless you go the salad route. Cheesy garlic bread is a must. Hey, if you're gonna be bad, do it right. 

The service can be slow at times, but everyone who works here is so ridiculously nice. Can't decide what to order? Tell them what you're debating. They can help you make the decision.

This is Charlotte's second Smashburger. The first is out in the Stonecrest Shopping Center in Ballantyne. So excited to have one near me. 

My current favorite burger is the truffle mushroom swiss. The barbecue, bacon and cheddar bacon a close second. There is even a regional burger: the Carolina chili. Warning: get extra napkins. You can also create your own burger and have the option to pick whichever bun style you want on existing menu items.

Don't do burgers? Get a chicken sandwich. They smash those, too!! The spinach, cucumber, goat cheese and the avocado club are both delicious. Refuse to eat something that use to have a face? Go with the avocado ranch black bean burger. Interesting texture and flavor. The salads are HUGE. 

I recommend going here with a friend(s) so you can share sides. The smashfries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. You can't go wrong with that. Haystick onions are delicious. SECRET MENU SIDE ITEM ALERT: fried pickles. 

This place is slammed at lunch. The parking lot is kind of small and awkward to get in and out of when it's busy. Note: there's only one way in and our of the lot. I learned that the hard way... twice. Both times while driving with one arm. #slinglife.

Since we're just around the corner from Beijing, we thought we'd give it a solid, college try. 

We looked up their website (www.beijingcharlotte.com) and were pleasantly surprised that their menu was available online. We scanned through and ordered the Crab Rangoon, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice and Beef w\/Mixed Vegetables. What can I say, our fridge was reeeaaallly bare, we wanted leftovers! I wish their website offered dish descriptions of each item. It would be helpful to know what exactly composes Schezwuan Beef. 

Hubs went to pick it up, as they do not have delivery service as of yet. A local food review mentioned that they were hoping to add that service in the near future. While I didn't pick up the food, hubs said that the place was decent inside. Nothing crazy, but a comfortable spot to stop for some quick food. Our food was ready in ten minutes - nice! 

Once our Chinese feast was brought home I tasted each dish. The General Tso's was my favorite of all the dishes. It's not the healthiest menu item, but the chicken had a well-spiced sauce on it and it wasn't heavily breaded. I could have handled more heat, though. The shrimp fried rice was just ok, I was expecting more veggies and egg within the dish. It was mostly shrimp, fried rice and chopped onions. The crab rangoon was quite tasty but the beef with mixed vegetables was fairly bland.

My friends and I saw Beijing while driving down South blvd one day and thought to give it a try. We went in for lunch and had a good experience...so we came back a number of times. Now it's time for me to give them props :)

The restaurant is very clean and well lit. When we've gone there (usually at lunch time it isn't super busy) and we've gotten great service. Very attentive. They seem to get a ton of business from takeout orders. I give a lot of credit to the servers because from what I've seen they're responsible for guests dining in and dealing with phone\/takeout orders. Not easy to do. In any event the service has always been great.

The food...To be honest I can't really speak on their selection. I haven't really perused the menu too much. The lunch specials have been too appealing to look beyond them. I've tried a couple of things on the lunch specials menu and they have yet to disappoint. Not only were they good entrees, but the portions are big and they come with choice of Rice, choice of soup and an egg roll. I know that it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants to have lunch specials which include those things, but it's always nice to get value for your $$$. Good food + good portions + sides for a low price = great deal. 

Now to be fair, the food doesn't blow me away. It's good, and it's better than mall food court asian food in terms of quality of ingredients and taste, but doesn't necessarily stand out compared to other traditional sit-down Chinese places that I've tried. But I've always had a good overall dining experience there and the food is always meets my expectations. It never disappoints. If I could I'd give it a 3.5

Rich, tasty, and very nicely packed to go so that they were easy to put together when they got home.

Oh, and the service. I really appreciated being offered a glass of water to drink while I was waiting for my to go order to be put together. Thank you!),(I know it's not actually cold outside, but I may or may not have turned the heat on in my car the other night. How did I ever survive Winters in Nebraska?

There is just something so comforting and soothing about a giant bowl of pho. During my latest venture here, I placed a take out order. The sweet server (without asking, completely on her own) brought me a cup of hot tea while I waited for my food. All the workers here are so nice. 

I love VG's pho. Delicious broth, good amount of sliced flank steak and meatballs, fresh fixings. I'm also a fan of the crispy pork rolls and the fresh spring rolls. I try to discipline myself to only order one of those, but temptation wins more times than not... and I get them both. I'm so weak when it comes to food.

My order of pho and crispy rolls came to $15. Seems a little bit pricier than other places... but nothing too terribly out of control. Did they raise prices here? I don't feel like it used to be that much.

Yes, Vietnam Grille is an odd stand alone location right in front of a shopping center on South Blvd. I know that can seem kind of sketchy, but trust me. Stop in for a meal... you won't be disappointed!),(The Pho train continues. Know this place to be one of the most highly revered in town when it comes to authentic Vietnamese, and I'm happy to jump on the bandwagon of believers. It's quaint, very simple inside and located off of South Blvd. Headed north on South Blvd, it's easy to turn in really quick. Located in the parking lot of Sports & Fitness. 

The rice paper rolls - best I've had in Charlotte. Very thin vermicelli, mint leaves were spectacularly fresh, crispy tofu and the peanut sauce was just wonderfully flavorful. 

Had to sample the pho, per usual at any vietnamese eatery, and I was thrilled. Simply put, it's just perfect. Savory and smooth broth, spiced well, filled with crunchy scallions, bean sprouts, fresh jalapenos, vermicelli, and a nice helping of thinly shaved beef.

He mentioned that he (quite literally) eats here four or five times per week...I can see why!

Inside, Vietnam Grille is pretty basic and super clean. The owner and the waitresses were all very nice and made sure that our drinks were constantly filled and we were enjoying our meal. I ordered the spring rolls and the chicken pho. The spring rolls were very good and refreshing - wrapped in rice paper and filled with fresh shrimp, herbs and rice noodles - and came with a tasty dipping sauce. I could have easily (and happily) eaten five more for my lunch. 

The chicken pho was the star of the meal though. The broth was light and nicely seasoned and it was the most generous helping of pho I've ever been served. Seriously, there was enough for three lunches. The chicken was tender and there were a ton, and I mean a ton, of noodles. If you want to get a delicious lunch that will last for days, this is the way to go.),(This isn't your usual ghetto Vietnamese Pho place. There is an *actual* menu in plastic and everything. They also don't have 10 different kinds of pho meat toppings that most people haven't heard of... which is kind of unusual for all the Vietnamese places I've been to. And they speak good English, again, very unusual.

I liked the spring rolls. I liked the pho. But the problem is, I just wish there was more of everything and that it was cheaper. I want more noodles, more meat, more bean sprouts! 

It's too hard to justify paying $9 for a tiny bowl when I know I can get a heaping bowl somewhere else for $6. I'd come back if I'm craving it, but I plan on checking out some other nearby options first.),(i have to agree with my buddy Benjamin G. on this one. I like Vietnam Grille's pho a lot and it's probably the best that I've tried. I'm reluctant to say that it's the best pho in Charlotte. I think that people overdo that ""best in..."" line. Just say it's your favorite. That will suffice. Unless you've been to each and every one of them, you can't really say that it's the best. but i digress...

Vietnam Grille doesn't have as many options as Saigon Palace and Doans, but their headliner, the pho is terrific. I think that their secret is the star anise. They put in more than their competitors and thus the broth is more flavorful and gives you that great aroma. I've had the rice paper rolls too and those were good. My buddies and I used to go to Sports & Fitness and would often get lunch at Vietnam Grille post workouts. I've seen them order other stuff from the menu and they weren't disappointed. 

It's pretty simple inside, but it's clean and nice. And the service is pretty good too. 

I would give it 5 stars if they had a greater selection. But overall I would definitely recommend it.

the pho is awesome here.),(---Brace yourselves, as this is a VERY long review----

Hanging out with other foodies in San Diego I was constantly dragged along on hunts for perfect pho. It was definitely a trend among the foodies to compare pho notes, finding the most bizarre and hidden vietnamese restaurants and bragging about it among other gourmands. 

The fact is, I never really liked pho, my friends would ooh and ahh and suck down giant bowls of it. I'd do the same, thinking to myself, well this is good right? I just must not get it. Pho never really seemed all that special to me.

Having moved to the mountains of WNC, my cravings for vietnamese food have grown exponentially, not pho of course, but delicious spring rolls wrapped with lettuce and the like, maybe a bahn mi sandwich. The fact was, there are no vietnamese restaurants in Asheville, and you always want what you can't have. 

On a recent trip to Charlotte I sought out the most accessible and highest rated viet restaurant, which just happened to be Vietnam Grille. I couldn't have been happier.

Open till 10, it fit right in with my schedule. Well lit, and open seating, I was pleased immediately upon entering. Wasting no time I asked for an order of crispy spring rolls. Delivered quickly PIPING hot, and amazingly crunchy, the spring rolls were like biting into little nuggets of heaven. A perfect blend of pork and shrimp.

When my server returned to take my order, I was torn between three items. The house special bun, the deluxe broken rice, and the pho. I didn't really want the pho though, it's just... that's what people get. I asked my server for his recommendation. He informed me that the pho was amazing. I winced, and flipped a coin for guidance.

Heads: Get the pho
Tails: Get something awesome!

The coin launched into the air, and landed in my palm... heads. Fate had decided for me. It was time for the pho. Once again I was amazed at the speed in which my order was brought to the table. The pho came out steaming, beautiful. From the aroma it was instantly apparent that this was no standard bowl of pho. This was something special.

I got to the process I'd seen time and time again, tearing up the basil leaves, putting the meat under the noodles, adding the sprouts and lime juice. Just as I went to reach for the Sriracha a man came to our table, he looked at my bowl and said, ""Before you use that, try it first"" ""People always ruin the broth before tasting what the chef has prepared""

I was taken aback, how could I be so rude? I instantly complied and brought a spoonful of the golden, transparent soup to my lips. To call it an explosion of flavor would be an overstatement, it was much more subtle than that. Tiny waves of flavor, layered together to form a perfect tapestry of delight rolled over my tongue. I had never tasted something so light, but full of character. Exceptional, something truly intelligent and delicious. 

Suddenly it became apparent to me what pho was supposed to taste like, it's supposed to be like this. 3000 miles away from my friends in desperate search of the perfect bowl of pho, I was sitting right in front of it, and relishing every morsel of it. And to think that if I were to have added even a drop of Hoisin or Sriracha I could have tainted this perfect creation.

The man introduced himself as the chef and co-owner Ricky Lai. The rest of my meal was spent having a fantastic conversation with Mr. Lai about food, thought, practice, and the fact that Asheville is in DESPERATE need of a vietnamese eatery. 

It was truly a pleasure to find and eat at the Vietnam Grille. It will surely become a source of pilgrimage when the cravings for vietnamese food become overwhelming.)"

My wife is a bigger breakfast fan than I am. I'm usually the one who prefers to eat light at home for breakfast and have a nice lunch out.

We both enjoyed our food and noticed that a lot of the dishes had a more healthy twist to them. I think that I'll enjoy the flying biscuit when I'm in the mood for it, but I think that my wife and I are more traditionalists when it comes to breakfast. She's a big fan of bacon and I tend to enjoy pork sausage. I do remember enjoying the pancakes and she enjoyed the grits, but outside of that I think I'm more in my comfort zone at Waffle House or ihop.

It may be a little hard to locate in the corner of the shopping center off of Baybrook, but once you find it, it's easy to tell it's a gem. 

A quaint interior with tables and booths and plenty of smiling faces. My wife and I stumbled in to pick up a pizza and garlic knots. The service was so fast! Ready in less than 15 minutes!

Let me take this opportunity to blow your mind. Eggplant Parmesan pizza. Yes. Commence drooling. Fried eggplant, marinara and gratuitous amounts of mozz on a pizza. Holy cow. Amazing. Chewy eggplant with a light layer of seasoned breading. The garlic knots were the best I've had to date. Not coated in grease like so many other places. Dusted with garlic powder and finishes with a welcoming chew. The dough is wonderful. Great for sopping up extra marinara!

So happy to have finally visited Riccio's! Can't wait to head back to our new little neighborhood pizza place!),(Riccio's is a family restaurant.  It has a great neighborhood feel, the owner has been there on every visit. The food doesn't wow me, but it is a great place to grab something to eat moderately priced.

We had pizza, two good things to mention, it is thin crust and they aren't heavy on the toppings.  It is a very balanced pizza.   I ordered a glass of wine, it was just bad all together, the glass had an odor, the wine tasted horrible, so I asked the waitress to get me another glass of something different.  The second one wasn't any better.   I think I will stick to ordering by the bottle or drinking beer.  Other than that, we had a fun evening.  Service is always tops.)"
Mbat8t9X0zPrpxd1mEGRcw,"Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.305848,-80.7542218,Nakato Japanese Steakhouse,160,3.5,"(On my way to a movie in Concord and I was craving some sushi....I thought of Nakato I had been once before for lunch and remember it being pretty good.  I've never eaten the hibachi - but they have a decent sushi bar, prices are a little high, and they lack on selection when it comes to rolls.  I really enjoyed my miso soup, and tuna tataki though.  If i'm in the area I'd come back but I wouldn't drive out of my way.),(Well, it's a good thing I wore a flowy dress and an adjustable slide belt to dinner at Nakato. Not only did my belt ""adjust"" on its own, but hubs and I took home a combined box of leftovers that fed us for a few meals afterwards, too!

I was craving hibachi like crazy, so we drove on up to the University area to score some tasty Japanese grill cookin'. Nakato is a pretty standard looking Japanese hibachi grill but also expect super high ceilings in the foyer\/bar area and expansive rooms with the traditional grills. Both our server and our chef were very friendly but no overly so. Hubs and I still had enough quiet time to chat or just watch our chef flip and twist the shrimp & rice in peace. 

So, where does Nakato really shine? Through the boatload of food that they dole out. It's almost ridiculous. My shrimp & chicken hibachi combo ($18.25) came with: Nakato onion soup, salad with ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer (literally two chopped up shrimp), a bowl full of rice (I paid $1.75 for the Hibachi fried rice), a hearty helping of noodles, grilled vegetables, shrimp and chicken. ZOMG. All of the food was truly tasty, especially when you added a bit of the ""yummy"" sauce that the chef provided. It.Was.So.Much.Food. I think my favorite was the shrimp, veggies and noodles. Nom. 

My only mini gripe about Nakato is the flavor - I would have liked to have a little more heat or spice in my meal, but otherwise it was exactly what I was looking for. Next time I'm craving 100 pounds of food and some mild entertainment, I'll come back to this Nakato in a heartbeat!),(A Benihana like restaurant near our hotel and where we dined for a team dinner on a week night. They do not seat you until your entire party is here, but sink into one of their leather couches in front. You will not want to get up.

Our party of 16 or so sat at 2 grill tables, circled around. I knew off the bat I didn't want teppanyaki, so I asked for a sushi menu. I started with the hawaiian poke salad (mix of salmon and tuna) and then two rolls. The 49'er roll (ode to the SF Niners) which was a CA roll with smoked salmon, spicy aoili (fancy word of spicy mayo) and scallions. I also went with another typical favorite roll of mine, the Rock N Roll, a crunchy roll with spicy tuna and smelt roe on top. 

Everyone was served salads and soup, and I also had a nice bottle of hot sake. Although I prefer cold sake, this one hit the spot. Service was great, but when the show began, we were definitley at the dull table. The other cook put on a fun and exciting show, doing tricks and everything you would normally see. Ours was...the quite opposite. When I asked him where our fun show was, he did a volcano thing with the onion, and THE END. 

The hawaiian poke salad was okay, too much sauce that was overwhelming. The rolls on the other hand were delicious! I was surprised at the freshness of the fish, and I liked how they didnt clump so much rice on the rolls. And surprisingly I was still hungry! Usually I can barely eat two rolls, but I was still wanting more! I decided to order another, the Spicy Snow, salmon, cucumber, and jalapeno. My coworker and I also shared an order of 4 pieces of fatty tuna. That was amazing, but for $32, the slices were awfully thin. Everyone seemed to enjoy their teppanyaki, and the noodles were good too. They do seem to cook their steak very well, so tell them your liking if you prefer it more raw.

My roll took forever, and people were wrapping up so I asked for it to go. It was delicious but the jalapenos were HOT! After one burning my lip, I had to take them all off.

We had two birthdays and I asked them for their options. Ice cream is free, but a birthday cake, song, and photo was $10. We opted for the latter, and the birthday gals enjoyed their treat. The cake looks almost home made, but maybe store bought. Its a good size for about 6-8 people, and it was really light and delicious! 

Overall, a great experience! Would come back again for the sushi! Service was great in the beginning but as more and more diners came in, it seemed harder to get a hold of the waitresses. I do appreciate them turning on the channel for the A's\/Tigers game for my avid A's fan coworker.)"

First things first, follow them on their social medias to see when they are open and what hours. It's kind of all over the place, and they could close early if they sell out of everything.

Currently, this pop up type business is sharing a kitchen with the Indian restaurant King of Spicy. When you walk through the door, KOS is to the left and Seafood Connection operates out of the bar to the right. There's a bouncer who greets you (why is there a bouncer? I have no clue). He'll point you to the line to place your order. I went the day before Easter at a random mid-afternoon time. There wasn't that long of a line. I've heard it can get crazy, crazy busy. So, just be prepared. I've heard it does move quick. Also, don't wait too late in the day in case they do get slammed and run out of things. I went with the Connect Platter (lobster and crab legs). Along with the crab leg cluster and lobster, it includes a piece of sausage, corn on the cob, potatoes and a couple deviled eggs. Total with tax was $30. This is a cash-only concept. There is an ATM at the restaurant. 

Note: there's not a ton of places to sit here. They pack up the orders in a to-go fashion, I would plan to take it home and enjoy. If you don't like butter and seasoning, you won't enjoy this. It's not healthy by any means, but it's pretty damn delicious. Everyone here was so nice and it didn't take long to get my food. I will definitely be back.)"

The inside is quaint and houses a small bar, a handful of tables and a few TV's. Not over the top with decoration. Just simple and direct. 

The staff was zipping around the dining area with multiple plates in hand. A wonderful Colombian culinary ballet was happening around us as we anticipated the arrival of our lunch. 

We started with the Tostones con Queso. Green plantains with queso fresco. Only 3-4 on the plate, but perfect for two to share. These things are topped generously with fresh, melted cheese. Chewy plantains and melted cheese? Might as well be a bullseye. 

I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana. A menagerie of flavors, textures and traditional Colombian dishes. The pork cracklin' was by far the most interesting item on the plate. Fried pork skin. It's like a high-five in your mouth. Like a chewy pork rind but succulent. It's a mammoth-sized portion. I'd recommend trying a bit. Eating the entire portion would be a bit much. The steak, egg and sausage were all fantastic. 

Here's the kicker. The herb mixes they bring to the table are the golden goose, the cheery on top, the KO punch and the holy grail rolled into one. Spices and herbs, olive oils that complement every dish rather well. Mixing each one in with the rice and beans....something I crave daily. Can't wait to come back in just for these.

I've been here a few times now for birthday celebration type dinners. Rule #1 at Red Ginger: make sure you get everyone in your party here at the same time. They won't sit a partial party at the hibachi tables. And do you blame them? How fair is it to sit you down when half your group is late? So, don't be a dick and complain about that.

Get your phone ready to video: the chef has a squirt bottle of sake and goes around the table to anyone who will take it. He won't stop until you wave your hand when you've had enough (I've tried every way to write this sentence and make it sound as least dirty as possible). I always get hibachi shrimp.

I think it's actually cool to have a few jars of nut butters in the bread aisle (for impulse buys or for those who may have forgotten to grab one while at the breakfast section), but to not have any next to the jellies and jams was just strange.

High notes: 

Naan. Easily some of the best naan I've had in town. Served piping hot, holds a great chew, serves at the unparalleled vehicle for all things Indian. It was awesome. 

Saffron Almond Paneer. This is a great passed plate and has tons of different flavors to choose from -- sweet, mild spice, herby. The paneer inside the naan was wonderful. 

The whole traditional side of the menu is great. Plenty to choose from and definitely doesn't disappoint with the portions served. We were all thrilled with our entrees and shared plenty with one another. Which goes to show, the pricepoint with the given portion, in my opinion, is rather fair. They brought us so much extra naan, rice, and there was plenty for all of us to enjoy individually as well as share amongst the table. 

Three of us made it out under $70 (no alcohol) and we were stuffed. The menu is definitely a bit pricier than other places in town -- Avg around $18\/person. However, I wouldn't let the prices deter coming back at all. The amount of food, ambiance (the patio is gorgeous on a temperate evening), stellar\/professional service, and location with ample parking makes the price per dish a non-issue. Or.....naan issue.

Cheers.),(As Todd. W mentioned, we finally got around to giving Copper a try. While I'm glad we finally made it to this upscale and cozy Indian restaurant, I'm not clamoring to go back there asap. 

The Good: The interior is lovely and the service is efficient, helpful and kind. Our Garlic Naan was super tasty and I really enjoyed hearing our waiter Sunny explain the menu (traditional vs. modern fare). This ambiance definitely caters to date night! They also offer great attention to their wine - the first page of their wine list details that they will decant your choice prior to arrival, look for special bottles upon request etc. That's a fabulous touch.

The Meh: For what you get, the main courses are a bit overpriced, IMO. My scallop dish was interesting with bits of fried shallots, sauteed pears and potatoes. However, the scallops were a bit undercooked and I was overall slightly underwhelmed by the dish. I supposed I was expecting more flavor. Same with the samosas. The shell was a bit too crunchy and I was expecting more spice and pizazz with the filling.

I'm okay with Rich missing my birthday every year if it means he will take me here)

First off.... the hostess gave me a birthday card when she took us to our table. It was signed by a bunch of the waitstaff. Plus, at the end of the night our server gave me a box of chocolate covered strawberries to take home. Happy birthday to me. Wow, that is some fantastic service all the way around.

What do you need to know before a night at the Pot? It is a process. So allow yourself two-three hours for dinner. Come hungry. Really hungry. Maybe the hungriest you've ever been in your life. We went with the four course experience

Cheese: The special. Bourbon Bacon Cheddar. Holy.

Salad: California. Gorgonzola cheese and raspberry vinaigrette make everything better.

Entree: We went with Coq Au Vin... delicious. I want to try the Mojo next time. I did land and sea, but was mad that I didn't go with the classic. Luckily, Rich shared some of his with me. I love all the sauces they give you. I'm a sauce whore.

Dessert: I'm about to explode. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the choices.. they all sound amazing. I picked flaming turtle... basically so we could also get a table-side fire show.

Drinks: there were martini specials. The strawberry blonde was very refreshing. The salted caramel was absolutely delicious. I also got a boozy cappuccino to go with my dessert. It came complete with a rock sugar candy stick to use as a stirry thing.

I could barely drive home because I was so full. I thought about sleeping in my car. It was all delicious. I think it would be great to go here and just skip out on the entree portion of the evening all together and just do cheese and dessert. That may be my plan next time.

Thank you Melting Pot for a tremendous dinner... birthday celebration round 5.),(If liking Melting Pot is wrong, I don't want to be right. 

Listen, I know Melting Pot is a chain and it's pricey...waahhhh wahhh. Guess what? I love melty cheese. I love melty chocolate.

The service at this particular Melting Pot is typically solid and they are great at handling substitutions. Don't like broccoli? They'll sub out for another veggie. Scallops get you down? Sub in some bird. Oh, and I haven't mentioned it yet, but the Green Goddess cream cheese\/sour cream\/herby sauce for the veggies is so good I want to marry it.

Yes, I had googly eyes the second I stepped foot in Nona's Bakery. It was treat overload - fudge, truffles, Italian cookies, pastries, cakes, regular cookies, cupcakes, cannolis, oh my!

Yes, Nona's has just about everything to put even the tamest treat fiend into a diabetic coma. The employees were really sweet (pardon the pun) and helped me choose just a few things to bring home...although I *may* have scarfed down a cupcake in the car. Just maybe. 

Here's what I purchased:

St. John Cake: 3\/5: A big ole cream puff stuffed with cannoli cream (w\/chocolate chips). Well made, but a bit too saccharine-y sweet for me. I believe I paid $4.50 for this large puff. 

Cannoli: 4\/5: It's a large, tasty cannoli! The shells are baked fresh daily and it's piped with classic cannoli cream & chocolate chips. My only gripe? Each cannoli is $4.50. That's pretty steep - even in comparison with another Charlotte bakery that makes fresh cannolis and only charges $2.95 each. 

Lemon cupcake with cream cheese icing: 4\/5: Delicious. The lemon cupcake was moist and hosted the perfect amount of lemon. The nice baker behind the counter suggested cream cheese icing on top. The icing was tasty but I'd prefer more cream cheese and less sugar, if possible. Plus, there was SO much icing I had to hack off half of it so I could enjoy the taste of the combo. $2.50 per cupcake, iced upon order. 

Strawberry cupcake with strawberry icing: 5\/5: My personal fave of the day. Again, the cupcake portion was delightful and paired with the strawberry icing, it was just lovely. This particular pairing wasn't as sweet as the lemon\/cream cheese frosting combo, thus it was fabulous. It tasted like a strawberry shake reincarnated.

Will I be back to Nona's?! Hell yeah...for a few Italian cookies and a slew of cupcakes.)"

My wife had the Angus Grinder and it was quite impressive. She enjoyed it and her only comment wa that she wished they had put the veggies on the sandwich prior to putting it in the oven as opposed to putting raw veggies on at the end.

I had a 9"" Meatball Grinder that was very good but unfortunately did not have a bold robust flavor that jumped out. The Marinara could have had a bit more zest to it and it would have been perfect.

Sisters, BIL, and I arrived an hour before the concert next door at Uptown Amphitheatre, so we stopped at Wet Willie's for drinks and a bite to eat.  After IDs were checked, we sat ourselves.  (No one greeted us save security, and everyone else were seating themselves...)  The colorful murals that adorned the bar wall with all the daiquiri flavor machines made up for the initial disappointment caused by the wafts of stale beer that greeted me at the door.  With so many machines already churning out varieties of daiquiris, I knew that I wouldn't be able to try them due to corn allergy (corn syrup), so I asked our server MJ if they had mojitos (no- discontinued daiquiri flavor; I was looking for the actual drink, anyway), or wine (no).  Just bottled beer (standard domestics- Coors, Michelob, Bud, and YuengLing lager).  ""Mixed drinks"" consisted of vodka or Jack Daniels.  Sisters ordered Bahama Mama and Pina Colada, BIL had a Yuengling, and I ended up with a Michelob Ultra- not bad, a little too bland, but no bitterness or aftertaste, and it went well with the pepperjack cheeseburger, with bacon I ordered. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/wet-willies-charlotte?select=cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA#cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA  The bun top had a dusting of cornmeal, so I set it aside, but the rest of the burger was delicious!  Cooked medium, had a nice kick from the pepperjack cheese (older sis found it too spicy), and had nice flavors and textures (good bread!)  Bacon was a bit too greasy, but I didn't pat them down with a napkin to absorb some of the oil like I normally do, so it was partly my fault.  Baby sis claimed them eventually, after everyone else devoured the chips and salsa app they had ordered.  BIL had asked for a Philly cheesesteak (made with grilled onions and mushrooms and topped with a homemade cheese sauce), but MJ must've forgotten it when I asked him about the beverage selections.  No worries, since the rush order didn't take long (two to three minutes?), was hot (not cold at all, considering it arrived so soon after the discrepancy was mentioned, and it was complimentary (due to the order being forgotten).  The fries here were TERRIFIC!  We all raved about them, and for a non-gourmet restaurant, the fries here were some of the best I've ever bitten into (delicious flavor and perfectly-crisped)!  

The plastic daiquiri beverage glasses had Wet Willie cartoon-comic graphics on them, so I asked MJ if we could take them home with us, and he said yes.  My sisters didn't want to keep them, so I now have souvenirs for this Charlotte trip!  :)

Could've been 3.5 stars if the beverage selections were larger, and please work on eradicating the stale beer smell!  Women's restroom was clean and stylish though, considering WW could be considered a dive bar...  Perhaps the restroom is part of The Comedy Zone, which WW shares the floor with?  

p.s.  There is an overlook\/patio where people can dine and listen in to the concerts next door.  You won't be able to see the stage, but you'll get to people-watch!

Like a ray of sunshine, a big smile curved at the corner of my lips as the familiar smell of pho wafted around me. 

Walking in, I was impressed with the modern decor that consisted of red booths, fairy lights around the walls, and a full fledged bar. The menu itself is a tiny booklet with great explanations of various types of Vietnamese food offered such as pho, hu tieu, and broken rice plates. It was really neat to read all the descriptions, making it extremely reader friendly to everyone, especially those who have never had Vietnamese food before. 

To share with my coworker, I ordered for us an order of nem nuong, fresh spring rolls with pork, and for an entree I got the small bowl of pho with chicken and thick, rice noodles. I even got myself a bubble tea, lychee flavor to be exact. This was definitely the closest to home I could get in North Carolina!

The nem nuong came out first on a nice clean plate with a small bowl of peanut sauce. Prepared in twos, my coworker and I each grabbed one and noted how nicely tight the roll was wrapped. The rice paper was soft and the pork was lightly pan fried, adding a crispness that provided a good variety of textures. 

My bowl of pho was hot and steaming when it arrived to the table. There were LOTS of chicken in my bowl and I loved how it was all white meat that was tender and juicy. The thick noodles weren't soggy and the broth itself was light. At first, I thought the bowl was kind of small, but after sipping my bubble tea, I realized I didn't have the stomach for any more. 

The lychee drink was SUPER refreshing and the smoothie-like consistency wasn't too icy. The tapioca pearls, however, were hard and didn't have any sweetness at all. They were also all clumped together which made it very difficult to suck up through the straw.

While nothing could beat a home-cooked bowl of pho, Pho Real was definitely real enough for me. Even though it did make me want to call my family ASAP, I'm super thrilled that I got to have a little taste of home away from home.)"

The odd thing is that there's no silverware. The food is served on a bigger-than-the-plate tortilla sort of bread. The object is to tear off pieces and scoop up the food. It's interesting, but again, no more different than eating with chopsticks.

With the Meskerem combo (a meat-oriented plate, but they have a veggie combo too), I had the opportunity to try a few different tastes. All of them were full of spices and vegetables that made for some great textures and flavors. I enjoyed it thoroughly and left stuffed.

They do have a limited (and rather inexpensive) beer selection. The usual domestics and imports available anywhere for $2.50 or $3.00. The water glasses were also kept filled.

An excellent meal and I would recommend it thoroughly, especially if you're looking to try something different. Yum!),(So I'm a sucker for Ethiopian food and Meskerem delivers every time!

Lunch buffet. Never been to an Ethiopian place with such a good buffet. Tons of choices with lentils and greens. Such good flavors in all of them. 

Their Injera is perfect. Put the fork and the knife down and sop up all of that good lentily mixture! 

If you are of the carnivorous group, plenty of beef options. Ethiopians tend to stick with beef since it is more plenty. Not too crazy about the meat options, but definitely interesting and always worth the adventure. 

The service is so nice and very friendly. If you're not sure what to order, (Shiro Wat would be confusing to most, I'm sure) they are very helpful. Don't be afraid to ask. They know most people aren't familiar with Ethiopian. 

If you choose to take leftovers home, be sure to keep your Injera separate. You want it to retain that nice and boingy texture!

Great pizza place in sister's neighborhood!  

My first visit here was a day shy of two years ago- I found a pic on my laptop of a Margherita pizza from here dated 8\/17\/11.  I remember thinking the pizza and calamari were great, and my spaghetti-loving sister enjoyed her selection, as well...

Tonight, we ordered drafts of YuengLing (BIL) and Honey Brown (moi), a bottle of Corona (with a lime wedge; sis), and waters all around.  Our server Blair was kind enough to let me sample the Waterkeeper Hefeweizen (one of two specials on tap) and the HB http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ#XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ before I ordered a pint.  BIL ordered the other draft special, Dale's pale ale, but he didn't like it, so sis asked if he could switch it out for another.  No prob.  For food, we chose the calamari to start, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w#69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w and an 18"" half-Elizabeth Special and half-Hawthorne's Special White, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ#1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ while nephew wanted the cheese pizza. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg#lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg  While I can't speak for my sister and BIL's usual pizza pick (Italian sausage, pepperoni, 'shrooms, green bell, white onions, mozz), sister and I LOVED the HSW, which had ricotta cream sauce, mozz, (lotsa!) pesto, and sundried tomatoes.

A great meal out almost always ends with something sweet, and I love tiramisu, so this was a must-try. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg#xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg  Sis ordered a slice of chocolate cake for my nephew. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ#fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ  They were BOTH absolutely amazing!  I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.  

Make sure you check the tab for accuracy!!

p.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.

For my meal, I ordered the Latin Wedge Salad which is filled with yumness - corn, roasted red peppers, iceberg, creamy sherry vinaigrette, avocado, boatload of cheese and grape tomatoes. The salad was one of the best I've had in Charlotte; it was super flavorful and ginormous. 

And of course, I had to try the Mac 'n Cheese, just for research purposes. Holy yum. Again, a huge portion for $6. It's absolutely a meal and half on its own. Per Fran, who is just incredibly sweet and friendly, her 'mazing mac includes cheddar, American and pecorino cheese. The service in total was top notch - all the servers were knowledgeable, laid back and offered great suggestions for we first timers. Although, I was clearly super full, I ordered the Chocolate Cake, again, just to see how it was. (Yeah right) 

Now, I'm a huge chocolate fan, but not always a cake fan because of the potential dry factor. I am delighted to say that the chocolate cake was fantastic - moist cake, delectable frosting (not too thick) and a huge scoop of whipped cream AND ice cream. You can say I made room for dessert and planned a long run for the next morning. 

I left Fran's Filling station with a super full belly, a huge bag of leftovers and the notion that I certainly want to be a regular here!)"

At 1:00 on a weekday, the place was surprisingly busy and we were only able to find two seats at the bar, where there was a large TV tuned into a sports channel. The bartender took our drink order (a sweet tea for me and my friend went with a Red Oak draft) while we reviewed the menu.

I settled on the hamburger Po Boy, which was probably a mistake. Not that it wasn't good, but it was a burger on a baguette with mayo lettuce and tomato. I should have tried something a bit more Cajun, which was my own dang fault. I did get the sweet potato fries as my side and they were absolutely perfect - sweet and salty and plenty of 'em!

My friend asked the bartender for a recommendation and went with that - the meatloaf. He said it was very good with the two sides - mixed vegetables and mac & cheese.

The service was good and I was very pleased with the price too. Good, good food. I could see into the kitchen from the bar and it looked very clean. The only downside is that the place is very small  only  a handful of 2- and 4-top tables plus 4 or 5 seats at the bar.

Would I come here again? Absolutely!),(Finally made it in to Cajun Yard Dog! This place can be a bit tricky with getting a table! Quaint inside, popular for sports fans and great food can pack out the inside in no time flat. My wife and I ventured in for an early-ish dinner on a Saturday night. 

The menu houses a phantasmagorical array of Cajun choices. Etouffe, jambalaya, seafood....all choices apropos for the bayou-seeking culinaries. 

First, we ordered a few drinks and an app. Great beer choices. Red Oak from outside of Greeensboro, and Abita root beer. If you haven't had Abita's root beer, you must. It's incredibly flavorful and not overtly laden with sassafras. The house-made chips are wondrously prepared. A little more done than most, served with herb sour cream and a BBQ cream. The BBQ cream is faint and sweet and the herb is much more pungent.

My wife ordered a menagerie of side items. Veggies, Mac n' cheese, fried okra and jalapeno cheese grits...oh, those grits. They are incredibly creamy and packed with flavor(s). All were fantastic. 

I had the chicken jambalaya. A HEAPING plate of jambalaya packed with chicken, smoked summer sausage, rice, spices and a brilliant sauce. Each bite is packed with that roux-y, tomatoe-y, spicy sauce and the chicken\/sausage chunks in each bite are subtle and plentiful. The level of spice is manageable for anyone, in my opinion. Not over the top but definitely enough for you to recognize throughout the meal. There was so much of it, I had to take most of it home!  

Prices are fair and the service was great. Next time, have to try the desserts!

So happy with this quaint, festooned with Mardi Gras accoutrement, Cajun joint! Can't wait to go back!),(Celebrating my son's forthcoming 14th bday.

Service was great too.),(I had the gumbo and the blackened mahi. The gumbo was delicious. It was spicy and had a lot of stuff in it. I would've gotten a bigger bowl if I had known it was that good. The Mahi was huge! I couldn't believe it was only $15. It was a really good value and included two sides. I got the smash potatoes which was good and the rice which was meh and a bit on the salty side.

I found this place on Yelp and it definitely did not disappoint. I don't think I'll be back in Charlotte anytime soon but this place would definitely be worth coming back.)"

As for the food, you'll be in and out in no time as the food comes out in a flash. I typically order the petite plate as and I unfortunately enjoy the included hush puppies a bit too much. :) It's not the best 'cue I've had in Charlotte, but I do enjoy it quite a bit!

Love the bread! Nice and crusty. A little overdone and perfect for their braised white bean mixture. A great surprise. 

Creamy Roasted Mushroom app was bright, earthy and packed full of different cheeses. Great starter. 

The food was great. Bucatini was fresh and full of flavor. Robust and rich. Much like Bucatini should be . A hearty portion but not far too much like many Italian places tend to do. My wife chose the Penne a la Vodka. The best I've had to date.

The service is just a little too ""iffy"" for us to give this place a solid review. The servers were attentive and friendly, but just not attentive when it came to detail. We had a Groupon and there was a slight discrepancy with the price. It made it a little bit hazy on how we were going to pay, what we were paying for and where the price(s) were coming from. 

Our server half-heartedly attempted to explain what our situation with the Groupon was. His best suggestion was for us to buy dessert and make our ticket more ""rounded.""

I joked with Billy, watch the food be fantastic, since I was judging it without even trying it. I realize this is not fair, but it totally seemed like a chain restaurant menu.

We ordered a couple of beers off the expansive beer list, where is the Dewey Decimal System when you need it? The beer menu is alphabetical, so if you want to try something new, you have to read the whole column to find the type of beer you would like.  Maybe it should be divided by style, then alphabetical.  No drink specials, booooo.  They only have pint night one week night. We weren't on the right night, so I did not process this information.

Billy ordered chips and salsa and a Monterrey chicken salad.( I was going to a movie so I was just going to eat some of his salad.)

Copied off menu:
Grilled marinated chicken atop crispy romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes, cheddar-jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, black beans, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips.

Surprise surprise, the salsa had a nice kick and the salad was really good. The ranch dressing served with the salad was fattalicious! YUMMY.

Judging from the remarks from other Yelpers, seems like a place, that you might want to avoid at peak hours.  But to meet a friend, sit outside, drink beer and have a snack, I was pleasantly surprised.

Dear Corporate people at Taco Mac, let your servers untuck their 
t- shirts. Please and thank you.),(Been here countless times to catch a game, grab a beer and have some bar food.

Just depends on the night I guess. 

a lot of people seem to dislike the food, but I think it's alright. I like the chicken nachos and the wings and the cheesesteak is pretty good too. But I'm rating it as bar food and not on the same scale as a fancy restaurant. To me, the draw here is the beer. Not every bar has the goal of having an endless selection of beer, and it does its job. And for bar food I think that it's up to par with a lot of the burger, wings, fried food places that I've tried. 

It's definitely one of the better places to watch a game.),(Wow!  I had a really cool experience here after a long day at work.  I walked from my hotel with the intention to get something fast and go but then the magic happened.  I walked up to the bar saw some of the hugest, clearest, big screen hi-def TVs everywhere and the middle seat of the oversized bar was open.  

On the main screen they had my beloved Yankees scoring 8 runs in the 3rd inning over Detroit, another tv had Broncos playing the Texans, and another tv had men's  USA basketball......I had to sit down.  I wanted to try something new so I ordered the rotisserie  wings with the new cracked pepper cayman flavor.  If you like spicy then this is the flavor for you - it has a great taste with a spicy kick.  I was not proud of this moment when my nose started running but the wings were so good that I didn't even bother to pick my napkin up to wipe my nose until all of my wings were finished (I have provided my before and after pics of my food).

Our server Quinn was fantastic during my last visit here Friday evening.),(I had heard mixed things about Sushi 101 and hadn't worked up the pre-meal courage to give it a go. One of my good friends and I wanted to grab some sushi for lunch one day and recommended it, so I happily obliged. I'm thrilled that we ended up the 101! 

It's an elongated set up. Long bar, a few tables along the wall, some high tops, and dimly lit. A few TVs and really strange local art -- all depicting celebrities of some sort. I recall seeing John Candy and Gwen Stefani of all people... Not sure of the motif they are shooting for, but it definitely stands out!

For lunch, this place is a freaking steal. Me and my buddy sat at the bar and ordered 20 pieces of tuna, salmon, mackerel, and hamachi sashimi, and we each ordered the lunch special -- a crunchy asparagus roll and an eel maki. The eel was pretty nasty. The brown, sweet, smoky sauce on top was a total ruin. It would have been much better sans the death liquid. The crunchy asparagus was divine. Holy wow. That sashimi? Right on the money, son! Goodness we chowed down and even ordered a second round! Fresh, flavorful, and a great choice for sharing. I even ordered one of the lunch specials for my wife, to go, and our bill was only $40! FOR EVERYTHING. I was shocked. Seriously a great deal for a sushi lunch. 

My biggest complaint is the temperature. This place was set at 60 degrees and I had to run and grab a jacket because the door kept swinging open. It just kept getting colder and colder. Not a huge deal and I would still eat here if it were set at 30 degrees!

They have some funky hours and I think dinner is served late. 

I'm definitely looking forward to lunch here again soon.),(If your looking for a good lunch special for $10 Sushi 101 always has a good deal - usually 2 huge rolls that are hard for one person to finish.  Other then that there is nothing too special about this place - the sushi is decent there is a large selection on the menu, service is ok.  I find it a little pricey for what you get.  The sushi bar is nice.  If you are in the area check them out for lunch.)"

Anyways, the only problem I have with this place is I can never decide what I want. I pretty much like it all. Turkey Reuben, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, Firecracker Wrap. If you dine in, you get free soup with your meal. Heads up: if Minestrone is one of the options... get it. Delicious.

You're there for a great 'wich and a free cup of soup. Yes. Free. As soon as you sit down, your server will bring it over with your beverage. 

As for lunch, I chose the Chicken Philly Wrap - a giant grilled wrap stuffed with hearty chunks of grilled chicken breast, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and wrapped with a big slice o' cheese. It was fresh. It was delicious. I would happily get it again sans mushrooms as those canned shrooms give me the willies.

Having only been alive in Elizabeth since January, these guys sure do have a lot to show for their quaint establishment. In the old NoFo on Liz space, for you locals. 

Kind of hidden on Elizabeth Ave. One sunken door and a long hallway into the small dining room. About a dozen tables and decent amount of bar seating. I'd recommend sitting at the bar. A little easier from a service perspective and fun to chat with the bartenders. 

We were intrigued by many things on the menu. Here starts the laundry list:

Apps: 

Mulled Pear Salad. As I've written numerous times before, I'm not a salad eater nor am I a fan of cruditè in general. This salad made me think twice about how to dress up arugula. Light, sweet, tangy, hint of spiciness and packed full of flavor. Served with a cold, braised pear on the side. Each bite was divine. Definitely worth it. Even for us carnivores. 

Zack's Confit Wings. Confit wings? Are you kidding me? This is a huge culinary plus for anyone who understands the process. Makes for such tender and savory poultry. Man. The chili-laden sauce they were tossed in was great. Sweet and spicy, tender. Served with fries, which I was surprised by, but pleasantly. Definitely worth another meal venture. 

Entrees:

Eggplant Stack. Talk about a gratuitous, panko-crusted stack of awesome eggplant. Seasoned well and topped with amazing buffalo mozz and roma tomatoes. Balsamic per usual. The mozz sang a different tune from most dishes. Peppered and rather heavily, but tastefully. for you veggies out there, hit it up. You won't be sorry. 

Crispy Chicken. Little did you know this was going to be a baller-status plate of fried chicken and waffles. Dude. Never had a more perfectly executed savory waffle. Whatever brine, seasoning and flour mix they're using for their chicken, I want to steal the recipe. I was blown away. Each bite made me want to explore every individual flavor. Wish I had seconds for breakfast the next morning. 

Service was incredible. Struck up a great conversation with the bartender. Great to get to know them and hear a little bit of their story. 

I'm impressed by Smalls. Apparently they have a huge garden on the roof. I really wanted to see it! They're using local products and using them well. 

I'd recommend for lunch. Still big plates with a smaller price. Huge bar as well. Full wine, beer (local brews) and liquor.

Smalls is worth your visit. Glad for them to be in the Elizabeth area. 

Cheers!),(I was so excited when I heard that a sliders bar was opening on Elizabeth.  These joints are everywhere in NYC and something I always look forward to.  Smalls did not disappoint and it is so much more than a sliders joint.  I love what they have done with the old NOFO space red, black, and white it's hip and classy.  There were so many delicious options on the menu I wasn't sure what to choose.  My sis and I decided to split a lobster bisque and the short rib sliders.  It's hard to impress me when it comes to lobster bisque because my mother makes the best I've ever had however smalls was extremely tasty - crab, sherry, cream, and I really enjoyed the flaky crust on top.  It's filling so I would share if you can so you can enjoy some of the other menu items. 
The short rib sliders melted in my mouth and fresh cut french fries I just can't say enough I will be dreaming about this food for a long time.  I can't wait to get back for more.   Our server was also very friendly which always deserves a big red star!),(Small place, big taste. I was fortunate enough to check out Smalls last week for their friends and family opening and enjoyed a small sampling of delicious items while taking in their modern digs! I'm incredibly impressed and delighted that Smalls only serves NC beer and makes everything in house - including all the bread and pastas. How awesome! 

Service is incredibly friendly and attentive...just as you want it! Be sure to pay attention to their super creative cocktail menu - this is one of the only places I know of in Charlotte where you can get a gin fizz! 

Hubs and I sauntered back in last night for a quiet, Monday night dinner. Here's what I had... 

Margherita Flatbread: 4\/5: Yum. Toasty, crispity goodness. The tomatoes and shards of cheese were incredibly fresh and a perfect start to the meal. Plus, it's served on a nice piece of slate...love the presentation. 

Chicken & Waffles: 4\/5: I've never had this Southern staple before (shame on me), so I was more than excited to try Smalls' version with, quiet please, salted. caramel. butter. Yes. That salted caramel butter completely makes this dish. The waffle triangles were perfectly fluffy and crispy and when they were accompanied by the hot, fried chicken, this dish will really made you smile. My only issue with the dish is that both pieces of my chicken were fatty and I had to dig around the bird to get great chunks of meat to accompany my insane waffles. 

Get yourself to Smalls and snag a gin fizz and a plate of the fantastic chicken & waffles.),(Smalls is now closed. http:\/\/www.wsoctv.com\/news\/news\/local\/customers-say-they-were-overcharged-hundreds-dolla\/nPNLm\/)"

I've been to good ones and bad ones. Champions located in the Marriott City Center is right in the middle. Nothing to write home about but it has all the basics. 

Want to catch a game? There are plenty of TV's around. The weird thing is that every screen was tuned to the same game when we walked in. We asked the bartender to put the Olympics up on a couple of them and she complied right away. So the trick to get what you want- lies in the hands of the bartender. (isn't that always the case?)

Looking for food? This place has tons of choices. Granted, none of them are gourmet, but for bar food, it was okay. And the portion sizes? Huge! Ordered some cheese fries and the plate of waffle fries was piled high and smothered in cheese, scallions, tomatoes and ground beef. Almost like a nachos plate. 

Want a beer? Rather than tell you what kind she has the bartender will point to a display across the room that you can pick your favorite from. It was my least favorite move of the night, as the service up to that point was pretty good.   Had it been me ordering that- I might have pushed back. As for my friend? He just glanced and ordered. 

And finally- the ambiance. Dark. Dark wood and dark lighting. This is a guy's place and if you are walking by the outside looking in- you may think the place is empty, but take a peek inside. My guess is there will be quite a crowd as was evidenced all the times we popped in. 

A sports bar is never going to be my first choice of where to grab a beer. But if it's sports you are looking for- check this place out. Just make sure the bartender knows what it is YOU want to watch. It's more fun that way!)"

Hmmmm, maybe I should give it a go. Fast forward to today.....

I decided falafel was the way to go today. I ordered a Mezze plate, choice of four appetizers on the list.  I ordered tabouli, hummus, hot tomato dip and baba gahnoush and a side of 3 falafel. Oink, oink. Even the waiter warned me that it was alot of food.  I thought that was nice of him to warn me.  Yay!  Everything was fresh.  The tabouli was perfect, I ate what I wanted then wrapped up the rest for the boy. I had to order a side of tabouli  to go because it was so yummy. I wanted B to enjoy the tabouli as much as I did.

I spent $22 today at lunch, that seems a little steep, but I will order the same thing again and happily hand him $22 more dollars.  There were plenty of other items to choose from, a great place for veg heads and a meat and greet.

- Grapefruit Mule - GWR Vodka, Ginger Beer, Lime, Grapefruit with Rosemary

It is still crazy here with tons of shoppers all the time. The prices haven't come down either.

Selection and stocking is excellent. The produce section is simply amazing with lots of organic options, lots of variety and lots of beautiful looking fruits and vegetables. Past produce, you'll find the fish counter. Nicely laid out with a helpful person here to make recommendations and wrap up your purchase. Beyond, the meat counter. Lots of delicious looking cuts of beef, chicken, pork and of course a bunch of things ready to take home and prepare. Beers, wines, cheeses, too many things to list.

Did you know that they have a small bar here where you can get a beer or a glass of wine? That there's a large dining area for you to enjoy your salad or soup or whatever you've had prepared at the pizza shop?

Parking upstairs is a mess. Avoid it. Take either of the ramps downstairs and it's much better laid out and easier to park.

It's still spendy - they don't call it ""Whole Paycheck"" for nothing. But there's terrific value and it fits well with the high end South Park neighborhood. Welcome, Whole Foods.),(Wow. 5 stars for a grocery store, huh? I've only been to a handful of these elsewhere and haven't found much that appeals to my grocery perusing self. Honestly, I've always thought of Whole Foods as a ""window shopping"" grocery store. Not the smartest way to utilize one's time, let me tell ya. Despite the astronomically priced goods and somewhat niche, organic, so-local-it-will-make-your-eyes-water type products, these guys earn a solid 5-star high five. Here's why. 

Staff. There is more staff in this joint than you could imagine. I counted 11 behind the cheese counter, 6 behind the fish counter, 6 at the coffee shop, and at least 2 people on each check-out lane. Every aisle had a representative to answer questions, talk up products, or help you find what you need throughout this organic wonderland. 

Local. I love seeing produce and from farms and farmers that are just hours away. There were vendors delivering local salmon, produce, meat, beer, and coffee while people were walking around. It seems that these guys aren't playing around with the idea of ""best products for where YOU are"" mantra. This does Charlotte well. 

Levels. This place has three levels. First floor is everyone's favorite grocery store. Second is a cafe and third is a cooking school. Yes. A freaking cooking school. That is so rad. They are definitely aiming to be more than just a store where you can buy stuff. The bottom floor is the parking deck. Get this. There are freaking escalators you can ride WITH your shopping cart. Hello, future. This place is just ridiculously cool. 

Although it is a grocery store, I think WF can do some really cool things in Charlotte. I'm looking forward to seeing how the beer\/wine bar on the 1st floor impacts the local breweries! So cool to see NoDa, Foothills, Birdsong and Olde Meck on draught! Yes. Draught, local brewskies at a freaking grocery store. Dig it. 

Looking forward to all that is to come for these guys!),(Salad\/soup\/hot bar review:

This location is the closest Whole Foods to uptown, which is not that close at all until they finish building the one next to the Westin which is currently a hole in the ground.  The market itself is large and spacious, but the layout was a little bit confusing for me.  Produce is all the way on the opposite side of the hot\/salad bar and the dairy products are all in enclosed cases with doors in the middle of the store.  Maybe I'm just used to other Whole Foods locations, or the crappy ones in New York City.

My sole purpose of coming here was to check out the salad\/hot bar... to my disappointment, there was a severe lack of choices and half of them were empty at 8pm on a weekday.  There were only 6 (?) soup choices as well and half of them were dried out or empty.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the vast food bars at NYC locations, but I figured bigger stores would have bigger salad\/hot bars that actually had food in them.

I won't complain about the prices of produce and items in general here, because we all already know about that and if you're going to complain about it, don't go in the first place :)

I wouldn't come here for the $8.99\/lb salad\/hot bar and definitely not past 7pm.),(Whole foods is my security blanket. It's in my neighborhood so if I need something quick I pop in. And I'm here constantly. To be honest, I'm here more than anyone. 

I pop in in the mornings for coffee daily. I come here to study. And more often than not I'm here for a quick coconut water, salad, smoothie, gelato, pizza, or even to try a new beer. I don't do the bulk of my groceries here, but if I want to enjoy some fresh fruit or if I want to grab an extra veggie for dinner that night, I quickly swing by for someone of their fresh produce. There's such a great selection of wine, beer, and dessert section too. Or if the wife and I are too lazy to cook, we'll swing by the hot food bar or get a couple slices of pizza.

Everyone know what whole foods is about. This one happens to be pretty awesome just like the others.)"

I could just sit in that empty stadium and hang out all day staring at the view. That being said, imagine my excitement when I first heard about a beer festival being held there. 

By far, my favorite thing about this festival was the lay out and footprint. They grouped the breweries and bottle shops by regions- Charlotte, Western North Carolina, Triad, and the Triangle. I thought this was a really cool way to do this. The festival wasn't on the field, but up where the concession stands are. Why is this huge? Because this means the festival was (for the most part) covered. And we had some cloud burst type rain come through on this day, so it was nice to be dry. 

This is the first year of the festival, so there were obviously a few kinks. The check-in process for attendees was a little chaotic. There was also some confusion among the workers for the VIP folks during the first hour. 

Food was provided by the ballpark concession stands. I thought this was absolutely brilliant on the stadium's part. I'm a firm believer to eat before you come to one of these things, however I had to get a hot dog. Come on, you can't come to the ballpark and not get a hot dog. It should also be covered in chili. 

Parking: there are decks all around, but they are not free. I got a kick out of the one directly across the street. For first timers, you can't get back out of the entrance. I watched a whole bunch of really confused drunk people trying to leave and were trapped in a huge line. Street parking is free on the weekends. May the odds be ever in your favor to try and score one of those spots. You know my motto folks, you shouldn't drive to a beer festival. Get a DD. Call Uber. 

Is the VIP worth it? I try to answer this for every festival. IMO, YES for this one. I felt like you get a lot and the extra $25 is completely worth it. I'm not sure if it will be the same next year, but for this first year you got to come in an hour early, use a private air conditioned lounge, private bathrooms, special beers not available to GA, and a parting gift. I believe the gift this year was beer to take home. 

I'm excited to see this festival really take off next year. Kudos to everyone involved.)"

I wandered in here on a Saturday night, on the September breeze that brought me. What I found was a fairly spartan arrangement, patio seating out front, and a cozy bar inside nestled in a corner. 

I chose the latter. Interesting though: when I asked if they carried an Ayinger Dunkel (there was a branded chalkboard hanging next to the bar), the bartender looked at me like I was speaking French and didn't know what a dunkel was...offering me a Chimay instead. I drank it, and for the next hour and a half or so I settled into a familiar rotation which included the tasty beers they did have on hand and some regular, solid wait staff service. Not a remarkable experience, per se, but definitely not a bad one. I'd try 'em again if the time was right.),(I stopped in at The Philosophers Stone Tavern two times on my last business trip to Charlotte - once for dinner, and once to get our booze on.

Let's start with the dinner.  I had a chicken sandwich, which I know is a boring order to begin with, but I wanted something lighter.  It was unfortunately as bland as it sounded.  Our server, Mercedes(?), was friendly though and made sure our drinks were never empty.  She also was on top of the local beer scene, which I appreciated since I was from out of town and interested in trying the local craft brews.  

Three nights later we were back, but this time to play Cornhole and outdoor Ping Pong.  3 hours and many, many, MANY drinks later we called it a night.  It was a blast.

These things are massive. You could probably seat 8 people at one, if need be. 

The brunch menu is pretty standard. Waffles, pancakes, omelets, all of the typical side item menagerie and some libations as well. I opted for the veggie omelet and did egg whites only. I had asked for no dairy of any kind, but still came with swiss cheese on top. No biggy. I just yanked it right off of the top! The flavor was great, though. Tons of shrooms, spinach, onion, and fluffy egg white flavor. Top with a bit of hot sauce and you're in business! I enjoyed the side of fruit, too. Just honeydew and pineapple. 

Our server was great. Very lively and funny. She made a small mistake with the check and made a quick joke, fixed it promptly with a smile, and brought a new one. Love the humility and easy going spirit. She was just great.

The restaurant is expansive with a large bar, pretty patio and spacious dining room. But the few times I've visited, I've mostly remained in the bar area. The staff is always quite friendly and swift - perfect if you're dropping by your lonesome or with a group. 

It's most certainly worth noting they run a sweet half off appetizer special from 4-7 pm Monday-Friday. And my favorite night to drop by is Wednesday for half off martinis. Scoooooore! 

A few other items of note...

My favorite appetizers: Feta Dip, Sesame Ahi Tuna Tapa, Spring Rolls, Asian Chicken Wraps. 

Some awesome martinis: The Dirty Encore is a classic and there's also a pineapple based option that is delightful. 

Other notes: Prices are very fair from the appetizers to the entrees. And for you gluten free folks, Encore has plenty of featured gluten free dishes!),(When I landed in Charlotte this evening, my best friend Sloan gave me 3 dinner options to choose from and we ended up at Encore.  It was perfect for what we were seeking: a great place for conversation, decent menu selection, and drinks too!

After commenting how the martini selection was pretty impressive, Sloan went with a Michelob Ultra and I went with a Firestone Gewuertztraminer.  Our waitresses were attentive enough, listening to our request to pretty much leave us alone as we planned on hanging out for awhile.  The one thing they did do, however, was card us - we liked that!

We did order the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer to start and enjoyed it... a little too much!  It was different than normal in that it was more like a flat bread pizza with a little extra dip on the side.  It was filling, rich, and creamy... it could've been a meal on it''s own.  However, we proceeded to order more drinks and 2 of the recommended dishes.  I had the parmesan crusted grouper and Sloan had the chicken and basil alfredo.  We weren't blown away by them, but they were not unforgettable either.  My fish was served warm but the veggies that came with it were cold... when I told our server, she brought an additional side of warm veggies for me - great customer service there!

We skipped dessert as we were both pretty full... neither one of us finished our meals, so keep in mind that servings are pretty big.  We noticed a private room for groups and a separate bar as well as outdoor seating.  If I lived in Charlotte, I'd come back for sure.  I have a feeling that Encore will be seeing Sloan again soon!)"

So we walked over to the local transit terminal to grab a quick bite at China Shuttle. I had a spring roll and shrimp egg roll. Everything came out quickly. There was plenty of seating. The decor was minimal. The cashier had lots of personality, which was pretty entertaining. Overall, China Shuttle cured my hunger pangs.)"

With a focus on hard work, locally sourced ingredients, supporting local farmers and frankly, making really really delicious food, Table 274 is well on their way. The restaurant is nestled in the back of Cotswold shopping center (behind the toy store) and boasts an expansive space with plenty of tables and large bar area. I've also seen the bar menu - it looks pretty delicious.

On to the food...I've been here twice now and here's what I've enjoyed....

Italian sausage & sweet potato gnocchi (lunch item): 4.5\/5: A really generous portion of practically perfect gnocchi. They make their gnocchi daily (no small feat) and this dish highlights them beautifully. It very sausage-y, so for those who dig a myriad of meat with delicious pasta, get this - you won't be disappointed. 

Strawberry shortcake: 5\/5: Light, fresh and damn delicious. They have a fab pastry chef on board and it showwwwws! I shared the dessert with a friend but I could have easily taken it down myself. 

Fresh made rolls & honey butter: 4\/5: I know it seems odd to comment directly on the bread but it was pretty great. Who doesn't love a fresh baked roll and honey butter? No one? That's right. 

Fig Prosciutto Flatbread: 3\/5: Pretty much the only item I didn't love here. While the portion was generous, this flatbread lacked both prosciutto and cheese. It was super figgy and I was looking for more of the ying and yang w\/the meat and cheese added to it. However, the peppery arugula on top was a lovely addition. 

Toasted gnocchi (appetizer): 5\/5: Nabbed this dish before dinner and, again, the gnocchi was wonderful. My Italian grandma would love it. This dish features warm prosciutto, spring pea & carrot - even the veggies were nicely cooked, leaving a bit of a crunch. I would happily order this for a light dinner. 

I have no doubt that if Table 274 continues on their merry way that they'll earn a 5th star in no time. It's a great addition to Cotswold...get your nom on!)"

Speaking of hot, it was right off the grill and plenty hot.

Service was good. There is a television (tuned to a Spanish-language station) and a small play area for the kiddies. Soda is canned Pepsi varieties, they didn't appear to have a fountain.

They have a great little patio outside that is ideal for some Uptown people watching.  I enjoyed some great wine with outstanding service.

Next time I am going to try one of their paella's they take about 35 minutes to make since they are made to order they all sounded fantastic.  There is a great selection of spanish meats and cheeses as well as several grilled octopus dishes.  This place is truly unique I can't wait to go back.),(Malabar ended up being one of the better meals I had on my trip to Charlotte.

+  Service.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful (menu suggestions, making sure the drinks were filled, plates were taken away, etc.)
+  The Salad.  I had the chicken salad and it was spot on.  Fresh greens, perfectly cooked chicken and some tangy goat cheese.  
+  The outdoor space was small, but it was shaded and comfortable even with it being in the mid 80's.)"

A little quiet when we arrived, we were the only occupied table in the dining area. I probably should have moved to the bar area that seemed a bit busier, but what the heck.

$3 draft Dos Equis Amber went down nicely while we chomped on chips (and GREAT ""Roja"" salsa) and reviewed the menu.

My daughter opted for the gringo Mexican pizza but I'm sad to say that she didn't particularly enjoy it. It's huge but it just wasn't great. She only ate about a quarter of it.

On the other side of the table, I opted for tacos. I mean, it's in THE NAME. So I got a plate of two tacos. Number one that was the Jamaican chicken. Excellent with some spicy jerk chicken and sweet fried plaintains on there. Yum! And the number two was the Chickpea Felafel. Absolutely excellent with cucumbers and pickled oions and Greek yogurt. Both were very tasty and delish. For my side, I chose the ""Spicy cilantro lime fries."" Tasty but not really all that spicy but the cilantro was sprinkled on top and the lime squeezed in there too. I definitely made out better here.

Several televisions tuned into the sporting events of the moment. Service was decent, even if we were the only folks at a table in the back area. Food took a bit, but fresh food cooked to order is gonna do that. No complaints.

Good vibe, good food, good service. It's good. I'm a fan!),(Tacos and rock n roll! This is one of those reviews that I am pumped to finally be able to update. Why? Because I'm adding a star!

Four of us walked over here for lunch after bowling across the street. We started with queso because every Saturday should start with queso. I ordered went with a two taco meal, one jalapeno mahi mahi and one tequila shrimp. Both were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. I love the Mexican street corn. I always get it. They do have some vegetarian options, including falafel, fried avocado, and roasted cauliflower tacos. I'm not vegetarian, but I would order all three of those because they sound delicious. 

This place has a great lunch menu on week days. The meals come with a drink and the most expensive thing on the list is $8. Such a great deal. They also have pretty good drink specials throughout the week.

My only problem with this place has been service. I still think there's a little issue there, but I think it is better.),(Heard about MRT opening on Montford and was stoked to finally have an opportunity to check it out. Made it in on a weeknight for an early dinner. 

Dropped off my wife to meet with a friend, so I was flying solo. Sat at the bar and enjoyed the rather large TV screens. The bar is a nice set up with comfy seats. There is also a long table directly behind the bar which is great if you want bar access, but don't want to be nose to nose with the beer taps. 

Started with a nice Dogfish Head 60 minute and the pineapple guac. All I can say is WOW. The chips are warm and thick cut. The guac is mostly smooth with a few small avocado chunks. The pineapple, which I wasn't sure was fresh or from a can, made guac a whole new revelation. Really underestimated the combo. They also had a habañero version, but I wasn't willing to venture down the capsaicin highway. Definitely would order this again. 

I went with the Ahi Tuna burrito sans cusabi (cucmber and wasabi) as I'm allergic. I was a little stunned with the blandness. The rice tasted like instant rice, thrown in to a lime juice\/cilantro mix. Really unfortunate addition to the burrito. I'd go without next time. The Ahi was a little overpowered with blackening spice. It was a perfect rare, just a little too overwrought with spice. I'd probably go for tacos next time 'round. 

All in all, I really like what these guys and gals are doing. Love that guac and looking forward to checking out more the menu! Cheers1)"

Inside the store, it's the same high quality that we Charlotteans have come to expect from this supermarket chain. Wide aisles, bright lights, well stocked shelves, and shopping carts that work. Oh, and don't forget their fab produce, bakery and meat departments.

Yep, Publix rocks. And it's giving Harris Teeter a good run for it.),(It feels like it took 20 years for this place to be built, but the doors are finally open.

This store is my first exposure to Publix. Well, I take that back. I think I bought beer one time at a Florida store during Spring break a million years ago. I don't remember anything about it, except I was probably under age. Sorry mom. Anyways, this location is a brand new store, so it's fresh and clean from top to bottom. Right now, there's an army of people working. Seriously, they have people in each aisle to help you. Granted, I'm sure this will go away once the newness wears off from this place.

Things I really like: 
-There's a parking deck. If it's a raining, you can park and stay dry. And so far, it doesn't make me want to stomp kittens like the Trader Joe's deck over at the Metropolitan. 
-You don't need a reward card to get sale items. I can't even begin to tell you how annoying it is to shop when you lose your VIC card for six months. Cashier: ""Can I have your phone number?"" Me: ""No, you may not."" *awkward silence* ""Oh, you need it to pull up my account? My bad."" 
-Pretty solid deli, produce, and bakery areas 

Noticeably missing:
-Local beers. I'm not sure if this is something that will change in the future.

Can't decide if I love or hate:
-The traffic light. Is this thing helping or making things worse on South Blvd?

Grocery store wars are heating up here in Charlotte. In terms of who has the best deals, just make sure you pay attention. I noticed that some items here are cheaper than say the HT or TJ's, but other items were much higher. You know the items that you buy every week, so make sure you figure out who has the best prices for YOUR personal shopping list.)"

The crab salad was surimi of course. Topped with spicy sauce and on top of a tangy vinegar, it was pretty good. The california rolls were nothing special. The chicken was fresh and hot with some onions and broccoli mixed in and sesame seeds sprinked on top. Brown rice was not very fresh (a little crunchy), but it was 4 in the afternoon.

Over all, a reasonable meal. Even when the 20% ""grand opening"" discount goes away, it's not bad. It's certainly fresher and probably healthier than the buffet at the other end of this little building.)"

The menu is pretty standard deli style. Sandwiches, soups, potatoes, salads. My wife and I usually go for a double-decker pb&j but sometimes we venture out of our mainstay. The potatoes are rather large with a gratuitous amount of toppings. Not my favorite, but worth a try if you're hungrier than usual. I love their Reuben. Not a huge NY style stack of pastrami.

Salad lovers, this is your mecca. Fresh ingredients. Long list of salads. Don't see one you like? No worries. You can build your own. And if you don't like that... well, there's really no one you can blame but yourself then. I usually go with salmon as my protein. I have to echo fellow Nikki W's comment... get it with pesto. (And yes, there are two Nikki W's. Watch out Charlotte)

Salads come with a crostini. I usually get a cup of soup with my salad so I can dunk this toasted crouton into it. My orders are usually enough to make two meals. Leftovers rule!

I go to yoga. For any of you that know me, you know I go a lot. After evening classes, I'm usually wiped out and a hot, sweaty mess. This place is so convenient to pop in and grab a salad or sandwich to go.

This location also has some pizzas on the menu. I haven't tried those yet. I can't bring myself to order a pizza at a salad place.

Only small problem is the parking situation in this area. Make sure you pay attention to where you are parking and obey all the signs. They do boot cars if you park in the wrong spot. You have been warned.),(Not much of a salad guy, but this place is a salad lover's Mecca. 

Anything you want. Huge bowl. Lots of stuff. 

They do an amazing job with their grilled tofu and shrimp, too. Love the flavor.

Make sure you're there when the cook who owns the salt shaker shows up.

I recommend the Chinese Shrimp Salad. Great combo of smokey, grilled shrimp and mandarin oranges.

A few girlfriends and I stopped by Crisp to enjoy a light dinner before heading to a show at Ovens. I'm so glad I did!

So, it's not full waiter service but all the staff were really friendly and helpful with suggestions when I went. 

I ordered the Cobb Salad and it was indeed delicious. Fresh romaine, bits of bacon, Monterrey jack cheese (subbed for blue cheese), tomatoes, avocado and tasty grilled chicken. The salad was tossed with their house Dijon vinaigrette which was really, really amazing. I could probably drink that salad dressing. Well, not really, but it was great.

This location is right next to a McD's an Arby's and a couple of sub places, so it's always hopping busy. Never stressed, the crew here seems to do a solid job and they've yet to mess me up.

I don't want to look under the covers and find out if Chik-Fil-A is any healthier than McDonald's. I'm just going to continue in my intentional bliss that it's chicken and therefore it has to be better than anything that Mickey D's has to offer. La la la la! Not listening!

Best invention at the Fil-A? Waffle fries! OMG, perfection. I could eat these all day long.

One tip. I really can't stand that pickle on my chicken sandwich. Even if I take it off, the taste is still there. They'll make you a fresh one if you ask. I just always forget to ask. Argh!

Other than seeing Dave Thomas in the Wendy's commercials, the Chik-Fil-A ""Cows"" are the best fast food campain. Seeing them on billboards and in commercials with ""Eat Mor Chikin"" is always funny. Nicely done, guys!),(The first fast food place I've been to with legitimately healthy options!)"

I was here a couple of years back (when they still let people smoke in restaurants) and it was good then (other than the smoke). Now, it's the same tables, the same waitresses (I think) and it's the same exact food - grilled and fried excellence.

Typical breakfast options (eggs and...) and the usual non-egg meals that I tend to expect in a diner. Rather than a grilled cheese, my brain took me to the club sandwich, which is a good bellwether for determining diner quality. If they can't do a club, they're not worth eating.

Well, my club was great. Perfectly formed with the toothpick through the center of each quartered sandwich, piled high with good tomato, lettuce, mayo, bacon and sliced turkey. A large pile of very hot steak fries on the side were an excuse for pouring ketchup onto the plate.

Decent prices - under $10 for a good meal including tip.)"

You'll want to arrive closer to 11:30 because it starts to get super busy after then and you'll be waiting outside. It is a very small place with a very tiny parking lot (more space down the road) and they will want you to go when you've finished enjoying your burger.

I opted for the double burger with cheddar plus fries. It didn't take too long to arrive. Two large 5 ounce patties with all the toppings on a nice bun. The meat was hot and drippy and delicious. Waffle fries were fresh and hot, soaking up ketchup very nicely.

I chose the $3 beer special, which is a random can or bottle of whatever they want to move quickly. It was a tasty milk stout that I enjoyed.

Our waitress was nice about wanting us to move along - there were at least forty people waiting to get in.),(Can't believe it took me this long to make it into Pinky's! The crown jewel of biker bar\/dive bars on the west side of Charlotte. Packed full of personalities, tattoos, the beer flows like wine, and tons of cardiac inducing treasures to be had. 

The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind. 

I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives. 

Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian\/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last. 

Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job. 

White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time. 

Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?),(Just.What.This.Area.Needed.

Yep, Pinky's fills the quick, tasty, cheap food void in the Wesley Heights area with a stacked menu, cool place and really, really great staff. A bunch of yelp peeps dropped by Pinky's for a grand old time and I got to taste a smattering of stuffs. Some of my faves from the menu...

Crab Hush Puppies: ZOMG. If a little crab made love to a hush puppy, this is its delicious baby. But it's also a big puppy. And served with a delicious tartar sauce. Oh, and there are 13 per order for $4.95. If that's not love, I don't know what is.

Pimento Cheese Fries: A heart attack in a basket, and delicious. I don't know if I could (or ever should) eat an entire basket by my lonesome, but these were magnificent. 

Pterodactyl burger: A seemingly basic burger, but nicely seasoned and well cooked. Oh, and it's a steal at $4.25. 

Veggie Corn Dog: The only reason I tried this is simply because I didn't believe my buds that a veggie corn dog could be delicious. Oh, but it is. Veg heads celebrate!

Fried Pickles: Perfectly fried with the light, crispy breading we all know and love. With the saucy sauce. 

Oh I'm a fan of you Pinky's and I'll be back soon...),(I didn't even know Charlotte had a Westside. YeAH, WESTSIDE!! in my best gangsta voice.
Pinky's is heading for success, it already has a comfortable feel, I can't believe they have only been open for a week, already feels established. 

I sat at the bar waiting for friends and this nice guy beside me shared his pimento cheese, seasoned waffle fries. He has a friend for life now. Sharing is caring. Guess what?  They passed my french fry barometer. Need I say more?

My hot dog was delish, I tried a bite of a corndog- soooooooo good. The outer heavenly shell was sweet, light and a little bit of crunch. Corndogs are sent from heaven. Pinky's had a nice mix of customers, single fun drinkers, the child slingers and nice men who sit at bars and share their food with the ladies. P.S. I told him to start Yelping.  Our check average was $13 without tip -food and adult beverage. I think that is flippin' fantastic.

I can see we are heading for a beautiful relationship. 
Crush factor: Orange),(Pinky's Westside Grill opened a little over a year ago just outside of Uptown Charlotte.  This is a fun and casual bar and grill that occupies the former space of a Volkswagen garage on the corner of Freedom and Morehead.  The old ""Triple 'G' Automotive"" sign remains outside and the owners left an old school VW Beetle on the roof of the building.  The Beetle has been painted over with a design of the American flag.

Pinky's serves bar food (hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, sandwiches, etc.) with a creative flair.  For example, you can order a burger ""Ding Dong Style"" with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and spicy Sriracha sauce.  They've also got ""Crab Puppies"" (like hush puppies, except made out of crab) and a falafel wrap, so there's some variety.  Prices are very reasonable here with most entrees under $8 each.

I tried one of Pinky's most popular burgers, the White Trash Burger ($4.50).  It comes with a 5 oz. patty topped with provolone cheese, fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch.  While the burger is not ginormous, it is pretty satisfying.  I noticed the server didn't ask me how I'd like my burger cooked, just like my experience at Kickstand earlier this year.  I guess it's a Charlotte thing.  Regardless, the beef is good.  The bun is flat and small.

The waffle fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries are Pinky's most popular sides.  I tried an order of their onion rings plus an order of their honey-cilantro slaw.  The rings and slaw are served in BBQ take-out-style paper trays.  The onion rings are long and stringy.  The batter is a little inconsistent throughout (both crisp and soggy).  When you get to the end of the tray, it's mostly large crumbs of batter.

The honey-cilantro slaw is very good.  While there isn't as much cilantro as I like (I *love* cilantro), the slaw is fresh and crisp.  The lettuce, onion, etc. are cut shredded into several long strands and the honey-mayo (or whatever sauce they use) is applied in just the right amount so the side isn't too strong.  I'd like to try this with a hot dog next time.

While I haven't had them, my friends really like the crab puppies, falafel wrap, and ""Stray Dog"" (vegetarian hot dog), so those are other dishes that have a seal of approval.

Inside the restaurant, many tall windows give you a nice view of the Uptown skyline.  The decor is an entertaining mishmash of all sorts of things including a Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet.

The servers are cool, the food comes out fast, and service is great.  When the check comes, they have no problems separating the bill between couples and singles.

There is limited parking available in front of the restaurant.  Your best bet is to park in the free lot across Morehead St.),(I'm a fan of this place. The food is always a hit. My go-to orders are the: Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich, Pimpin' Fries or the Fish Tacos. I never get tired of it. Their specials are good too. I usually end up at Pinky's once a week or every other week and it never disappoints. The waitstaff is tremendous, the atmosphere is cool, and they have a pretty cool beer and cocktails selection. And the prices are very reasonable too. A+),(Great prices!  Large, eclectic menu and super fast and friendly service.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the tiki bar type setting.  So many unusual decorative items they are a conversation piece in themselves. Fun drink coasters with brain teasers.  No fun details were overlooked.  

The waitstaff tag teams all the tables so patrons have everything they need and there is a fantastic team environment.  

I had the white trash turkey burger with onion rings.  The next time I will order something different.  I couldn't taste the provolone cheese, and the turkey burger tasted just like beef.  So much so,
I needed to double check!  The onion rings are a huge portion...  Don't even attempt to eat it alone.

The entire family can eat here without breaking the budget.  Parking is way on the other side of the restaurant. On Friday there is an evening rush that starts around seven.  Make sure you get there before then.

An umbrella fell on my sisters head and they deducted $3.75  from our check, which is the reason this place didn't earn four stars.),(Housed in what was formerly an auto repair shop, Pinky's Westside Grill is a heck of a great find. Not a dive by any means, but a funky diner with a light hearted way of serving up some seriously delicious food. 
I had the burger w\/pimento cheese which was outstanding!!! I am eager to try some of the other offerings, notably their corn dog and bologna sandwich.
Service was exceptional!!! Attentive, friendly and helpful.

I was in town for a meeting and a few of us decided to grab a bite before I left town. Everyone agreed on Cheddar's because we typically enjoy the food and you can't beat the prices. 

We were seated immediately, but we sat in our seat for about 25 minutes before a server came by to introduce themselves or get drink orders. Two members of our party were there before we arrived so that was about 30 minutes. A hostess came by an apologized to us and said she'd have the manager take care of our appetizers for the wait. Later our server came by and he was very nice. He was apologetic, but he didn't have to be. We weren't seated in his section, the hostess asked him to take care of our table. 

The food was good. I usually get the Key West Chicken and Shrimp, but this time I ordered the Mango Talapia with carrots and broccoli casserole. I also had edamame. Everyone at our table was pleased with the food. The group seated behind us encountered the same problem. They hadn't placed drink orders or met their server. The group complained and we shared that we'd just encountered the same issue. Cheddar's was surprisingly over staffed that day. Everywhere you looked there was a server, but apparently the section assignments were wrong. The manager came out to the group seated near us and began to explain as well as help the servers get orders. 

By this time, we'd all finished our food. We were patiently waiting for our bill, while we watched the madness unfold behind us. It took us another 15 minutes to get our bill and the appetizers had not been comped. Everyone was ready to go and paid quickly without even bringing up the promise the hostess made earlier. 

I think the food is always good at Cheddar's, but this is the first time I've experience such poor service with so many servers on staff. Stop by if you have time, seriously, about 2 and half hours is required.)"

We each ordered two rolls. We went with the Hilo Poke Roll, Spider Roll, Hamachi Ponzu Maki, Krazy Roll, Panko Tuna Roll and the Alaska. That food didn't stand a chance. It was all good. I really liked the combination of the Hamachi Ponzu Maki. Spicy Yellowtail and Cucumber Roll, wrapped with Yellowtail and Avocado, Shaved Serrano, Cilantro & Shisa Pesto. I don't think I've ever had a roll with pesto. Hilo Poke was also great.

I also ordered one of the boozy bubble teas. It's like an interactive milkshake for a big kid. Oh, but with some alcohol. 

There is free parking available in the lot across from the Fillmore. If you don't feel like walking, there's also usually valet right inside the fountain area. I think it's just $5. I always go for the free and the exercise... well, unless it's raining or my shoes are too big.

Great bulk items including all sorts of nuts and powders and candies and such. There were even some excellent sugar free items on display! Bakery? Amazing! Confectionary counter? OMG.

I will say that I'm happy to find an assortment of Vosges chocolate here. A difficult brand to track down, or at least track down the more reputable flavors\/varieties.

Nice to see a local coffee shop amongst other tightly packed businesses on Selwyn Ave and what a wonderful addition it is. Stopped in for a frostier coffee beverage on a hot Saturday afternoon. 

I was met at the door with ART coming out of every orifice! Tons of paintings, hand-crafted statuettes, pottery, jewelry and other mixed media pieces. None of this distracts from the overall aesthetic. Just like it says on the outside of the shop: Art Coffee Goodies. In that order. I felt like I was standing in a gallery whilst watching the barista make our beverage. So much to look at and always changing, from what I understand. 

The menu is pretty standard for a coffee joint. Coffee, espresso, lattes, frappes....The one thing that make FABO great is option of beer and wine. Not many shops have all of these under one roof. I could come in here and work for an entire day, fully caffeinated mind you, or wander in on a Friday evening with my wife, grab a glass of wine or a beer and peruse the art. That's versatility. 

Happy to find some goodies near the front of the store. Local honey, leather bags\/wallets and some food items too. Some supplemental to lunch or a light dinner. Look out. If you're not careful, you'll just ask if you can move in! All of the amenities for a creative type under one moniker. 

Thanks for the ice-packed coffee, FABO! Looking forward to a weekday visit to get some work done and inhabit your inspiring atmosphere once more! Cheers!),(I have to update my FABO review...now that I feel like I live there, I can properly assess all the other wonderful pieces of this fab-u-lous place.

Art: CLT has some really, really impressive local artists. If you haven't checked out the art here, you're missing out, holmes. And the jewelery is slammin'. 

Beer & wine: They have it. While I could stop there, I won't. They have unique wines - chocolate, chocolate raspberry, New Age (aka - Cougar Crack), and plenty of the beer and wine you're used to and fond of. Drink it on the patio - it's gaw-geous. 

Food, Treats & Vendors: Focaccia bread, pepperoni rolls, Beverly's Gourmet dips and such in a fridge, Secret Chocolatier, Cloister Honey, delightful croissants, muffins, baked goods, Tizzert's treats...the list goes on and on. 

Coffee: Tasty beans, friends. My personal fave is an iced almond latte - it's like crack in a cup. The quality of the coffee is pretty superb. 

Work space: You need some quiet space during the day? FABO's got it. Break out your laptop and sit your butt down at a table or a comfy couch. Or, if you have a book club, board meeting, etc. - this is a great space to host it! 

Staff: Some of the nicest in Charlotte. Welcoming, friendly, helpful - just grand overall. 

Community outreach & charity: A *huge* supporter of fellow local businesses (evidenced by their many cool partnerships & events) and big-time supporter of doggies. You'll spy many a pup in need of adopting in and around FABO. Pet the doggies, they're sweet. Then adopt them.

I can't say enough good things about FABO...it's one of my fave places in CLT.),(Art, food, and drinks.......what more could a man ask for these days?  This little place has it all and I was able to view it during a CMYE.

Selection is good and the art pretty fab.  A nice little addition to this part of town.),(For all those fortunate type-from-wherever-with-Wifi hoards who call the coffeeshop their office, there simply can't be a more convenient respite than FABO. 

Adorably decorated partitions separate sections and fill them with conversation-friendly couches while in other areas, you can find a communal table to plug away on. In other words, there's plenty of seating and plenty of choose-your-own-adventure options (bar, outdoors, couch, table... endless!) Should you seek coffee sustenance, the full bar can readily arm you with an iced latte or hot brew.

Find yourself there later, or just looking to casually sip on wine during the daytime hours, FABO shares its concept with The Glass House (a petite wine and beer offshoot that seamlessly blends into the coffeehouse space). The available selection offers some finely curated wines that you can enjoy by the glass and also craft brews sure to please any suds snob. I hit the peaks of pleasure when my gorgeous glass of Sauv Blanc had a $6 price point.

As a guest, I typically have moderate expectations as I know the restaurants in question can be absolutely inundated with customers. And sometimes the participating restaurants shine. And sometimes they totally take a digger. 

A group of girlfriends and I decided to make a reservation at Bernarndin's for Queen's Feast so we were able to check out a variety of items on the menu, catch up, etc. The interior is still lovely and hasn't changed much since Ratcliffe on the Green - the few exceptions being that there's more ""artwork"" of sorts on the walls. 

We were seated fairly promptly and our server came and walked us through the menus. Now, I completely understand that everyone (servers included) can have a rough day. Or a rough night. Or even a rough few days. And I'm certain our server was having one of the above. Girlfriend didn't crack a smile the entire night. She didn't seem happy to be there or even remotely interested in serving us. A few of us tried to make her laugh and that didn't even work. 

On to the food and drinks...we all ordered a cocktail of sorts and when one was misdelivered to my buddy, and identified as such, the server replaced it with the correct drink and then took it away ""to trash it."" Um, why wouldn't you just offer the drink up to the table to enjoy rather than throwing away a perfectly fine cocktail? Odd. 

Food wise, I went off the restaurant week menu (because it was very different than what I saw online - which is fine, I know they have to make accommodations with ingredients) and ordered the scallops. I snacked a warm roll, drank my nicely made dirty martini and waited. The scallops came out in a very nice sized portion with loads of risotto and, unfortunately, plenty of oil. My scallops were cooked nicely on one side (seared to perfection on the top) and a little under cooked on the other side. The flavor was nice on those little discs. However, the risotto and pools of oil that had coagulated in the corners really turned me off. Said risotto was cooked nicely but it was completely overloaded with salt. And the puddles of oil ruined the fresh taste of the scallops. Sad. To be fair, I tasted my friend's filet and it was delightful. I had total meal envy. 

For dessert I sampled a bit of my girlfriend's peanut butter cheesecake with Oreo crust - nicely done, great flavor and texture. I ordered the strawberry shortcake which was very light and airy but lacked sweetness. My dessert was *fine* but I wouldn't order it again. When we received our bill, from grump-a-pot-a-pus, our gratuity was automatically added - to the tune of 20%. Automatically adding gratuity to a six top is all fine and well, a) let us know that you did so, in person and b) usually when I see an auto-gratuity it's in the 15-18% range. 

Now, if I received this type of service and sub par eats during any time but restaurant week it would be a stretch to rate Bernardin's a 2 star. But to be fair, the restaurant was packed, our server was in a crappy mood, so I'm hoping I just went on a very off night.),(So after my lovely encounter with management on my first visit......no wait......there was no encounter...he ignored me.....oh well....I decided I wanted to try the food this time at lunch.

And I've been back for a year and still managed to not find time to get here. So when an out of town friend wanted to meet for a beer, I suggested we give this spot a whirl. We were not disappointed.

He had the OMB Copper and the Dunkel. I stuck with the Captain Jack (a pilsner) and had two of those. Really tasty and with a good sharp flavor. I could drink bunches of 'em. We sat inside so we could talk, but outside there was a live band. They also have food - sausages and other German haus food - but he wanted some of our great BBQ so after the brews, we headed elsewhere. Five beers for under $20 plus tip - a pretty good deal.

Factoid: Captain James Jack was one of the signatories of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, which predates the US Declaration of Independence by a year. He was also one of the representatives from our area to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. What a journey that must have been - no airport, no highways. It's over 500 miles and that's with I-85 and I-95. Wow!

I'll definitely be back to OMB! Hooray for Charlotte and all these great breweries that we're getting!),(Still 5 stars, but with some very worthy additions! 

1) The Christmas Market is so much fun! Local merchants, delightful eats and, of course, plenty of beer. Fun for the whole family...except for the beer, if the kids are under age. 

2) Their private room is fabulous. Check it out! I hear it fits about 80 people...company party anyone?!

3) Live music! Over the summer and as of late, OMB has done a great job of hosting super cool events like a cornhole tournament and live music at the tasting room. Go. 

4) Food. Yup. Now they have a bit of German food to stave off hunger while you're trying their super fresh beer. Brats and more from a very casual food window. Nom nom. 

Now I just gave you four more reasons to check out OMB if you haven't already. Prost!),(The bones of this brewery are classic in the pint-lifting sense: vaulted ceilings, lots of group seating, plenty of open space, three sizes available for all brews. I'd have not been super surprised to run into a few modern vikings here, arms akimbo, toasting into the night. 

Alas, this remains modern day North Carolina, where the breweries don't work the wee hours and where vikings aren't often in line to tread: we sauntered in here for roughly the last thirty minutes of open they had going down, and that was that. It's worth mentioning that the OMB offerings are pretty terrific by many microbrew standards, and I sipped my way through a couple of different sizes in the brief time we had. Definitely worth a gulp if you find yourself nearby.)"

This place is right next to Heist. My friend Sammy, aka the pizza expert, has been talking about about Benny's for what seems like forever. He went to VA Tech, so he knew all about the Virginia slice concept. 

The slices are the size of your head. Actually, they're bigger than your head. By the slice, it's $4-$5. It's so large that it needs two plates. As for the pie, it's 28"". TWENTY-EIGHT. I'm not even sure how they heave these things into the oven. Cheese is $30 and topping types $38.

I decided to get a piece of each monthly special, the buffalo chicken and the garlic mushroom. Did I need two pieces? No. Did I finish them both. Nope. Not even close. I love the crust. It's thin, crisp, and perfect. 

This place just completely changed the late night scene in NoDa. Benny's is open until 2am on Thursdays, 3am Fridays and Saturdays, and midnight all the other days. 

They just opened a couple nights ago, so they do have a few kinks to work out in the beginning. Pretty cool to see a King of Pops cooler right up at the front. Congrats and good luck Benny's! We are so excited to have you here.),(Pizza the size of my infant son!""


-Me, upon my first visit

I highly recommend taking advantage of the monthly specials. Most of the time, the flavors are rather adventurous and tend to offer quite a range of flavor for a pizza. Also, the beer selection is worthy of being paired with some good pizza.),(Good pizza. Not amazing, but solid. Huge slices. The atmosphere is cool, especially the music. The customer service is excellent. The decor is far from a 10, but it fits the NoDa vibe. There are several tables inside, most of them large, but some of them are near the bathrooms. There are two picnic tables outside, but they're next to the parking lot. If you want to chill outside, go to the brewery next door. 

Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.)"

This place excels on a level of Italian procurement that hasn't accurately or sufficiently been defined by the culinary world. Located off of Providence (and a bit difficult to squeeze in and out of their faux parking lot) it's the neighborhood shop for all those seeking to attain the level of ""savant"" in preparing their pasta-laden meal(s).

First of all, the staff is so friendly it hurts. They genuinely are interested in what you are preparing. They aren't trying to shove a $200 wheel of Parmigiano into your shopping bag. They want to help you acquire the flavors that you're looking for and, without a doubt, they'll have what you're looking for. Have no idea what to prepare? They do. Ask one of the staff members for a recommendation and they'll hook you up with the starch, protein or mise en place to pull off a meal like Mario Batali in a super hero cape. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the smell. Breath deeply, newbie shoppers. You'll breathe in the fresh garlic, herbs and fresh pasta being prepped in the back. What a treat and right in your Myers Park backyard. 

I've ventured in on several occasions for dried pasta and other canned goods (pepperoncini peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc) but you can't beat their fresh pasta. They have over 10 different kinds in-house. My favorites are the garlic rosemary or the wild mushroom. Sampled a few of the others and they are all wonderful as well. All are ideal for preparing ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti or any other pasta dish you're looking to make. 

This place is a market titan for its class. Wonderful selection, staff and overall presentation. Look forward to visiting every single time!),(I just realized I never wrote a review on Pasta & Provisions.  I think I secretly wanted to keep this gem to myself.  I don't want anyone to know why when I make pasta it always tastes so much better then theirs.  That's right the secret is fresh pasta but who has the time to make it themselves these days.  I frequently stop by Pasta & Provisions to pick up all kinds of yummy stuff.  I love that I can get everything I need in one place for a great Italian meal and don't have to hassle with a large grocery store.

The garlic and parsley pasta is amazing.  They import a lot of food items I can't find anywhere else.  In fact they carry a sausage that I've never been able to find in twelve years of living in North Carolina.  Grab a loaf of their fresh baked bread and one of their homemade sauces and you have a great meal in no time.  You can also pickup a prepackaged meal like lasagna, chicken parmesan etc. & don't forget to check out the wine selection.  If you eat Italian food like I do then this is the place for you.

Besides the great food the staff  is incredibly friendly and helpful which  keeps me coming back for more!),(Yup, I am in love with Pasta & Provisions. Not just because they have freshly piped cannolis, but also because they have such a great selection of fresh Italian fare and ingredients. Plus, the employees are ridiculously nice and helpful.

Their fridge selection has all sorts of delicious traditional, home-made Italian goodies: meatballs & marinara, stuffed jumbo shells, lasagna, tiramisu, fresh pasta, etc. If your seeking specialty Italian items - this is the place to go. They have special canned tomatoes, imported pastas, wines, cheeses, etc. that will elevate your dish to the next level. They also offer large scale meals and catering for the ""I'm pretending I can cook Italian"" dinner parties. :)

And back the cannolis...holy yum, this is the first place in Charlotte where I've found fresh cannolis...if only I could convince them to make them with pistachios! Mmmm thanks, Pasta & Provisions! I'll be back soon!),(I just love you. Thanks for the pasta for last night. People went insane over it. The lobster and crab ravioli is the best.

Jackson's offers free WiFi, a plethora of tables, couches and chairs to complement an all around comfy atmosphere. It was super quiet when I stopped in, and there were roughly 10 people on their laptops. Can we say productive?

I only interacted with one employee here and she was very nice, accommodating and happy to describe any drink or snack I pondered. If you're not a coffee drinker, they have a nice selection of loose teas that they can make hot or cold for you. While it's not the best Americano I've ever had, it did the trick.

It's a well-frequented place by people working in the immediate area (i.e. consultants, Bank of America employees... etc).  It's a pretty popular place no matter what the day is because of it's convenience in the Uptown area.

I've visited on several occasions at this point as it is a solid place for a decent dinner.  They have a very large menu with items for people of all appetites and diets.  In particular, they have a large selection of cheese and charcuteries as well as meats.  Service is decent and the atmopshere here is great, especially for a business dinner.

I've had many of the things on the menu and the items that stick out are the charcuteries (so many to choose from and it varies daily), the scallops, which were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the duck breast and hanger steak which was also cooked to the preferred temperature and well seasoned.  Also notable was the delicious mussels - the tomato-y garlic sauce was so flavorful and amazing you'll want tons of extra bread to soak it all up.  You honestly can't really go wrong with anything on the menu - I've tried other people's dishes and they were all great.

The star at Rooster's, however, is the coconut cake.  I'm a huge fan of cakes in general and I don't usually sway in the direction of coconut-flavored things, but the coconut cake here is amazing.  I've had it twice dining in and was craving it so bad one week that I even took one on the go to enjoy back at my hotel room.  It definitely tastes better when you dine in because they pour much more of the delicious vanilla bean sauce on it, but either way, it's great.  The cake is super moist and together with the sauce, it's amazing.  If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is a definite must-get.  The pecan pie (which I am also a huge fan of in general) was a huge meh for me.  

Solid place for an after-work happy hour or business dinner with lots of things for every palette.),(***Rooster's specializes in meats roasted and grilled by fire and the end results are satisfying as the kitchen achieves crispy and smoky sears to go with rich and moist meat; Rooster's also has upscale notes in the design of the dining room as well as their non-meat choices like a good variety of cheeses and macaroni and cheese that is not infused with truffle oil like a lot of places but instead topped with a fresh shaving of summer truffle***

Rooster's is a meat and poultry centric restaurant in Downtown Charlotte.  They specialize in their proteins grilled or spit-fire roasted and you can definitely tell fire plays a large role in this restaurant as several of their BBQ meats like pork shoulder reveal a great smokiness while their grilled duck breast combines a charred and crispy skin with a rich, moist and red center.

Of the meats I tried, I liked their duck breast the most.  It was simply prepared and seasoned, but the incredible char they were able to achieve on the outside of the duck breast gave it a great smoky flavor.  The juiciness was also excellent.  It was one of the most well prepared duck breasts I have had to date.  The grilled hanger steak was also good but did stand out compared to great hanger steak preparations I have had at other restaurants.

Rooster's also features an impressive variety of cheeses including good goat cheese and blue cheese choices.  Sides are served a la carte here and their goat cheese with arugula and peaches salad was fine, but the most satisfying side was their macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy but also had a crispy, lasagna-like crust.  For the macaroni and cheese, they also offered an option of summer truffle shaved tableside (at a very reasonable cost) and the summer truffle was quite fragrant and pungent.

Service was very good and friendly.  Prices were not too bad.  At first glance, prices might seem high here since the preparations appear to be so simple, but the quality of proteins is very noticeable as Rooster's meats are well marbled and the high heat from the fire allows the fat to evenly melt, which provides a soft, juicy and very flavorful experience.

Rooster's has a contemporary dark wood dining room with large booths.  The booths are definitely designed for big crowds given that meats and sides here are served a la carte to allow for easy sharing.

Rooster's was the best dining experience I had in my limited stay in Charlotte.  The food was prepared with skill and care and there were enough Southern touches like pimento cheese and pan fried corn to make this restaurant feel unique to the area.  I think Rooster's is definitely a good option for an upscale and satisfying but not too pricey dinner in Downtown Charlotte.

I do not know what the parking situation is in this area.),(I will be honest, I thought this place would be better than it actually was.  I had the half chicken, which I had heard was a must try.  It was a must not order again though.  It is not that the chicken was really bad, it just really lacked any flavor was was not very weel cooked.  It was that... ""Is this done?"" type of pink.

When you walk in the place looks great and I was hoping for more than undercooked food and horribly slow service.),(So I had been in Charlotte for essentially a year for a project and working right near the epicenter. As part of my usual cadence of restaurants, rooster had ended up making its way into my dinner rotation. The spot has always been busy but relatively easy to grab a table. The joint has two floors with street level being a bar with a couple of high tables and the top floor being an open kitchen feel where folks are able to see the kitchen and a slew of tables. The décor is a bit rustic and there are rooster statues around to honor the name of the restaurant. The servers are always friendly and I was always greeted promptly at the door.
 
Over the many times I have been here, I have ordered a whole slew of items which included the wings, onion soup, charcuterie, hangar steak, short ribs, pork shoulder, mac and cheese, pan fried corn, spinach, and etc. The place is great to go with large groups or just small parties and as long as the person is a carnivore, this is definitely a place to check out. All the food I have had has been well cooked and tender. This joint is solid for the versatility and options across all the pasture and from the sea items and there always seems to be something that someone enjoys. I have enjoyed the hanger steak the best which was cooked to the right temperature and well-seasoned. The short rib was also tender but there are moments where it was a bit too fatty so some consistency if there was any critique on the dish. The charcuterie options are also good and I have enjoyed all the different cuts of protein available. One of the things that is really good on this menu is also the section I least go to for any menu. It is their coconut cake off of their dessert menu. I really don't eat desserts often but this one is pretty amazing. The cake is extremely moist (ugh hate using that word but best way to describe) and it comes poured with a vanilla bean sauce over it. A fellow yelp elite ordered it and I promised to just take a bite the first time but I think I ended up eating half of it. Whoops!

All in all, a solid place for dinner with the options and make sure to save room for that cake!),(This hip new American eatery is 80% of the right pieces. Right look? Sure. The design of the menu and the food should all rock. BUT...  Start with the pervasive attitude that starts at the front door that is, at best brusque. We didn't have a reservation, and I have no problem eating at the bar, but I have a BIG problem with the hostesses just being so put out about you having the nerve to show up on them and tilt their day.  Better training sets a better tone. Of course it was no better downstairs at the bar. Busy place, but when you sit for five minutes and wait for one of the three bar staff to get around to helping you, and finally have to reach out to them to get them to slow down and deal with you, not a warm and fuzzy feeling. The menu was dynamite, BUT... When the food came out?  My pork chop had been brined so long that half of the salt in the Dead Sea was in it. My grits were tasty but dry and lumpy. The haricots verts were drowned in butter. It was just sloppy cuisine, either executed by a staff not under its chef, or a chef that doesn't really care what the consistency of his dishes is supposed to look like. Once you get the bar staff to slow down, they were really cool people. So TONE is the big thing up front that needs changing, and some love for the food in the back, and this could easily be as good as the Yelpers here seem to think it is.)"

It sounded more like a nightclub than sandwich shop, but I'm so glad that we gave it a try.

if you've been to which wich then you won't be a stranger to writing your name and order on a brown paper bag. It's a lot like that, but with a more mom and pop feel to it. They have a great selection of sandwiches, with fresh and quality ingredients, freshly made soups, macaroni salads, slaws, etc.. and your usual fountain drinks. You can order a combo of a sandwich and chips or macaroni or potato salad or slaw. 

I ordered the Cuban sandwich my first visit and the Beef on Weck the second time. Both were phenomenal. The macaroni salad was extremely fresh and delicious too. I have yet to try the soups, but my colleagues loved them. My colleagues ordered the pulled pork and loved theirs as well. I think that they also have breakfast there too.

The prices are very reasonable. They even have a student discount.

The food was out quick and the owner and staff are always extremely friendly. There is a decent amount of seating since most people seem to get their food to go at lunchtime. They definitely get busy during lunch so you should give yourself enough time. 

All in all, this place is easily my favorite for lunch around the Gateway area. I would definitely recommend to anyone in that part of town for lunch.),(I'm pretty sure I was the only one of perhaps 20 customers in this joint that the staff did not know by name. This could be a testament to the fact that folks in the South really are friendlier, or perhaps it's just because Karma Kafe's food is damn good and people keep coming back for it. 

I think it's some sort of combination of the two, because the staff here is absurdly nice, and they really did make me an excellent sandwich. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my Cuban, although in my experience authentic Cuban bread is soaked with butter before serving. I don't need anymore butter though, so i'll take it. The Beef on Weck is also a winner, although SOME PEOPLE think they need a bit more horsey sauce. But SOME PEOPLE are pretty picky about the sandwich that other people drove through the rain, bought for you and brought back for you to eat in comfort though, too.)"

No, they don't take reservations. Just go ahead and get over it. Sure, it would be nice. You know what would also be nice? If they gave me free cocktails, but they don't do that either. See, it sounds pretty ridiculous now doesn't it? Expect a wait. There's a wait for a reason. Go early and put your name on the list, then walk downstairs to Twenty-Two or over to Workman's Friend for a drink. They'll text you when your table is ready.

If you looked through the user pictures on here, you've probably figured out that the pork belly tacos are the most popular item. I agree, they're my number #1 at Soul. I also like the tuna tacos, soul roll, and hamachi with jalapeno. My most recent adventure here was with the lovely Sarah C and we felt it was our duty to order the giant shells and cheese stuffed with pork belly. I can't think of anything on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. My roommate and her bestie love the shrimp ceviche. Cocktail menu is also great. I usually always start with a Tito's Cucumber Mule. 

Price-wise, this is a place where you can very easily spend a lot of money. It's easy to get caught up in the delicousness and order a bunch of plates. Sarah and I split four small plates and three cocktails... $87 before tip. 

Only other thing you really need to know: parking blows. The JLC WearHouse across the street closes at 7pm, so I'll park there or the breakfast place next door to it. Just make sure to pay attention to all the signs in this area before you park.),(Goodness, Soul. You make Tapas and Gastronoms fall in love so easily. 

There are quite a few things worth trying: 

Brunch: On Sundays. Best Greek Yogurt with honey I've ever had. Perfect and pretty sure its made in house? 

Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepeño give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin. 

LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time. 

Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic. 

FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing. 

Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch. 

Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting. 

The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night. 

Love Soul. Places like this make Charlotte more unique. The dining experience is different every time and there always seems to be something new to try. Culinarily daring, busy as all get out and worth every penny.),(After just getting back from NYC and eating some fantastic food... of course.  I was still craving the cuisine you can find on every street in NYC.  That being said I adventured back to Soul.  I hadn't been in a very long time and things have changed for the better the menu has a lot more variety now and lots of sushi.  

I highly recommend the pan con tomate & pork belly tacos truly fantastic.  The sushi was a nice surprise fresh and tasty.  Ahh the drinks also bring me back to a little mid-town at $10 a pop the prices are almost equal as well but the drinks are well worth the cost.  This by far has been one of my favorite meals out in the last 4 years living in Charlotte.

Tip this place gets packed so be prepared to wait.  It's well worth it.),(Soul Gastrolounge can get really busy - so expect to wait outside or on the stairs for a table.

Because of the exciting choices on the menu, I was pumped to try out this place.  Armed with a Corporate card and a coworker, we arrived at Soul on a Wednesday evening and hardly had to wait.  We both got a table outside, which was actually really nice on an early fall evening.

Service was great - our server was very nice and our plates were cleared quickly and waters always full.  

For food, we ordered the following:

Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos - ain't nothin' ""Asian-glazed"" about these tacos... unless something like five spice qualifies as ""Asian"".  However, these were my favorite out of the bunch we ordered.  The pork belly was nicely cooked, really flavorful with the ""Asian Glaze"" and the watermelon salsa (really just marinated watermelon) added a nice flavor to the bite as a whole.  I would probably rather have this without the tortilla.

Ramen bowl - very large serving!  The first 5 bites of this was really good, but then it just really became way too salty.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy and reminded me of the kind that comes in American instant ramen (Top Ramen).  What really stood out here were the veal cheeks that basically melted in your mouth and the amazing goat cheese fried mushrooms.  YUM.

Bone marrow - pass.  This hardly tasted like anything and was basically a ton of butter on some crostini.

Flatbread - truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - actually quite tasty, but hard to eat.  It was very soggy, but had really good flavor from the mix of ingredients.

Korean BBQ wings - I live in NYC... where Korean chicken wings are a real thing and really delicious.... unfortunately these do not compare.  Chicken wings need to be more crispy, in my opinion.

For dessert, we got the banana chocolate phyllo turnovers - such a good decision and at $5, it was very reasonably priced.  However the star of this show was the banana pudding ice cream - SO GOOD.  Too bad they don't sell it by itself.

I'm not really sure what to call this place... like an American\/Asian ""fusion"" or what, but it's a decent place for drinks and tapas with a good environment.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to food, only because I've had far better in NYC.  Bottom line - decent food, great atmosphere.),(I came to the incredible realization last night that I haven't written a review for Soul yet?! Since I've eaten here, oh, I don't know seven or eight times, you think I would have gotten around to it by now. Nope. So, here we are. Months later and I've had many a dish at Soul. The interior is cozy and dark, the staff has always been friendly and helpful while choosing from their extensive menu. Yes indeed it can get crowded, so plan your evening accordingly! Here's the low down on the dishes I've tried:

White Bean & Goat Cheese Dip: 3\/5: Tasty white beans mixed into a (cool) creamy goat cheese. Served with snappy little pita chips. I kind of wish it was warm, but the flavors make me come back to it often. 

Goat Cheese Crostini: 4\/5: Toasty balls of goat cheese atop a lovely crostini piled with tomato and onion. Yum.

Shrimp Ceviche: 5\/5: Bangin'. Just damn good. Perfectly prepared and full of flava. 

Guacamole Stack: 2\/5: Meh. Not bursting with flavor and I'm always searching for some type of carb to pair with this lovely stack of avocado. 

Tuna Tacos: 3\/5: I love the fresh tuna & the sauce but I dislike the overly fried flavor of the encompassing taco shell. 

Soul Roll: 5\/5: DELISH. One of my favorite sushi rolls in Charlotte - 'tis flavorful, punchy and super fresh.

Gyro: 2\/5: I prefer Showmars, frankly. The meat or mix within the meat tasted sweet?! A bit strange. 

Cupcakes: 3.5\/5: I've tried two types and had two different reactions. My first was a cookies & cream - it was tasty but dry. Sad face. Then, last night I tried the snickerdoodle cupcake - delicious, not dry whatsoever. Mouth watering cinnamony sugary goodness topped with buttery frosting. Nom. 

I know I'll be back to this eclectic eatery soon - there is truly a dish for every bud and tastebud!),(Ohhhhhh, ScottWeaver, I believe you can get me through the night.... ohhhhhScottWeaver, I believe we can reach the morning light...

I was out running around and my friend called me, brinnnnng, brinnnnng, (that's my cell phone ringing, but really when she calls me it's Another One Bites the Dust) do you want to meet me at Customshop?  Why yes..  We meet there and she is out in the street telling me they are out of vodka.  Sunday brunch, out of vodka, what a travesty. 

So we head to Soul, I have heard great things about Soul, but I wondered if the hipsters would kick us out of their club or would the servers be hipper than thou, boy, did I have them pegged all wrong.

Everyone was really nice, food was spectacular and they have great hand made cocktails.  We had bloody marys, my friend ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered an egg and bacon biscuit.

The hit of the day was the cast iron skillet of pimento cheese mac & cheese and of course,  the DJ,Scott Weaver playing great music.),(As always when I come home to visit my folks in Charlotte I am faced with the dilemma of finding restaurants to eat out at that not only tease my palate with some new flavors but also manage to not scare them off in the process. It's usually just my mom dining with me, so that relieves some of the pressure of pleasing all 3 of us, which is truly an unenviable task. This time around I solicited the feedback of a few fellow Yelpers in Charlotte for some new places and decided Soul Gastrolounge offered up so many options on their menu that surely I could find something to satisfy us both.

It seemed to me that most of the complaints people had with this place revolved around the wait to get in, or just poor service in general, but I can definitely assure you we had neither of these problems (although mom likes to eat dinner early, so we got there a little after 6PM). In fact our server Marlon was one of the most attentive I've ever had, and constantly updated us on the progress of our items, since we ordered so many different plates. The pace of the food was all done well, and only at one point was our table completely overflowing with dishes, to which we just stole some space from the one next to us for a few minutes. All of the drinks came out within just a few minutes of ordering as well. Maybe we just got lucky, but this service was on point the whole night.

At first glance the huge menu here seems to be a total mishmash of things from all over the globe, prepared in every way imaginable, the kind of thing that Gordon Ramsay would come into a restaurant and blow a gasket over. After a little further examination though you can see some of the connections, although I still think they should do away with a few sections altogether and focus more on the remaining dishes. The pricing of everything here (with the exception of the $18 lamb lollipops) is all pretty fair though, so you can try just about anything on the menu without a huge investment, a nice departure from the ""small plate"" pricing schemes in DC.

We began with their spicy feta dip, which had a nice thick texture but I couldn't get past the strong Pimento cheese flavor, something that quickly reminded me I was back in NC. I did like it, but not sure I would recommend it. Next out were the Boursin cheese stuffed piquillo peppers served over mini-bruschettas. The flavors here were a bit muted for me, something my mom was a fan of, but I guess that's due to my inexperience with piquillos and expecting them to be spicy rather than sweet. So, if that's more your style then this dish is definitely done properly. The last of our teaser bites was easily my favorite, the French fries with garlic-herb salt and truffle oil, and we wound up snacking on them throughout the whole meal as a nice base point for flavors when we wanted to alternate back and forth. The truffle presence is pretty potent here but the herb flavors do a good job balancing it...definitely request some of the spicy mayo for dipping!

Our first meat dish to come out was the chimichurri beef skewers, really well cooked cubes of beef with a hint of pink and a side of dipping sauce. Thankfully the chimichurri was for dipping, because it was a big disappointment compared to other versions I've had, but at least the meat was good. The sticky veal shortribs with the five spice honey glaze though were superb. The meat falls right off the bone as it should and maintains tenderness throughout. I really loved the traditional Asian flavor combo of hoisin and five spice here too. The lamb lollipops are clearly the star of the show here, although I wish the rosemary flavor was a bit more pronounced...and I hardly ever say this, but they cooked have been cooked just a bit longer to get a nice sear on the outside.  My favorite dish came next, the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa. We were worried they wouldn't be available, as our waiter told us there was currently a watermelon shortage, but someone managed to find some and deliver it to the restaurant just in time, whew. Glad they did, as this was a unique flavor combination for me that really worked brilliantly. The high didn't last long though, as I was thoroughly disappointed with the shrimp ceviche, mainly due to the coconut milk base which was entirely too sweet.

Dessert was a mixed bag, with the eggnog cupcake being OK, thanks in part to a heavy dose of rum-spiked frosting, and the pistachio ice cream being much better. There are nice big pieces of whole pistachios mixed into the ice cream which not only enhanced the flavor but added a nice textural element.

I really appreciated the effort they're putting into the cocktail menu here as well. At just $10 a piece you can get some pretty creative combinations, such as the Dark N' Spicy using dark rum, ginger liqueur, Saranac ginger beer and fresh lime juice, much better than the ""Stormy"" version. Basil Smash was also good, but the Sweet Heat had too much syrup and not enough kick.),(Came here with a group of four on Thanksgiving eve without a reservation and the place was packed, both inside and outside on the patio.  We left our name with the hostess and went to the bar, which was also full, so we stood around with others while we waited to be seated.  The whole time while standing at the bar, we noticed an empty table for four, perfect for us.  After about 15-20 minutes, we were seated at this very table.  Wonder what took them so long.

Soul offers a variety of tapas and sushi and we ordered several items including: the crunch roll, goat cheese toasts, yellowtail roll, hamachi roll, chicken skewers, Asian wings, sashimi tuna tacos, little neck clams, sticky veal shortribs, and Mediterranean wings.  Everything was excellent.  The fish used in each of the sushi plates was fresh and delicious.  The sashimi tuna tacos are really fragile, though and pretty much break when you try to pick them up.  Each tapas or sushi dish runs about $7-8.

The inside of the restaurant is dark, stylish, trendy, etc.  Candle-lit tables, comfy booths and chairs, nice atmosphere, and a good spot to take a date.  In fact, one of the people I ate with like it so much, he decided to take his date here the following Saturday.  Additional notes: water here is optionally served with a slice of cucumber, the bathrooms are unisex, you have to walk up\/down a set of stairs outside of the building to get in\/out of the restaurant, and service was good.),(Update time! We finally made it back for dinner last night and suffered only an hour wait. Soul is a busy place, let me tell you. While it IS very small, I can see why it takes so long to be seated: it's not a normal restaurant where one would order their meal, have it delivered, eat it, and then leave. No, not at Soul. Once we were seated we ordered a round of tapas... which did come out rather quickly... ate them... decided we wanted to order more... and more. This is a process in itself. Our group of 4 agreed on 3-4 dishes at a time, probably totalling 8-10 tapas and 2 cupcakes during our visit. Soul is known for their sushi, but I personally thought the lamb skewers, brussel sprouts, pork tacos and fried clams (the special) were my personal favorites. Sadly I woke up in the middle of the night with a HORRIBLE stomach ache- a lot of fried food, and while it comes in small portions, it is deceiving. Beware. We have been eating a lot of meatless\/healthy\/raw lately, so don't let the size of the tapas fool you. That stuff is heavy. Ah- and how can I forget the fried goat cheese? It was divine. No wonder my stomach hated me last night. :)),(When my friends told me about this place in Charlotte that had a large variety of food and they started listing out the food, I thought they were just pulling my leg. Literally they were talking about tacos, wings, sushi, ramen, mac and cheese, paninis, and the list goes on. When I heard of all the choices, I thought it must be one of those spots that don't do anything really well so they just go for pure diversity so while I was apprehensive about heading to this joint as my last meal for my final work trip to Charlotte, I decided to be open minded and give it a shot. This joint is located in an area which has apparently gone through a lot of modifications\/upgrades over the recent years according to my friend. The spot itself is up a flight of stairs and there are some patio seats outside and the moment you step inside, you see a bar along with a few booths and tables around. 

The spot has a policy of only seating tables when your entire party has arrived so something to keep in mind if you are going with a large group. We were seated quickly given our group was present and we were given menus quickly after. Sure enough this place has a ton of options and while we had a tough time narrowing it down, we went with Asian Glazed pork belly tacos, lamb lollipops, Dirty South Nachos, Shells and Cheese, Korean Chicken Wings, the Cuban panini, and the Red Dragon Roll. We also ordered off the drink menu as the bar had an extensive menu so should be a lot of options for any type of drinker. The Asian Glazed pork belly tacos were out first and they were good. The pork belly was tender and while the watermelon chunks were a bit big, it actually was not overwhelming. A solid fusion starter for sure. The Dirty south Nachos were out next and these were really good although the presentation of it was quite interesting. The pimento cheese fondue was good but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for and ended up being just a bit too much cheese for me. The lamb lollipops were by far my least favorite and I would recommend staying away from it. The meat was a bit tough to eat and there wasn't a ton of flavor on this but we ended up ordering enough food to not be starving. The Shells and cheese were good and while I did not think the BBQ pork would go well, it ended up being a solid dish and I was pleasantly surprised. The Korean chicken wings were Good and I bet they are probably considered very good given the lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte. A good dish for the local market so props to them for it. The Cuban panini was very solid and definitely a crowd pleaser. The meats were tender and it was the right balance of all the ingredients to make it a tasty panini. The roll that we ordered ended up being solid for rolls. I don't eat too many rolls anymore but it tasted like a solid roll and the fish quality was good surprisingly. A hidden surprise and I think something that would do well in the CLT market.

All in all, I think the food was good at this joint. I actually want to give this joint a lot of props for trying a lot of different fusion combinations that while sound weird, actually ended up being Good in the end. I certainly think that it's a solid spot in the CLT dining scene and want to give them props for the risks they are taking for these unique recipes.),(So, so good. My only regret is not ordering from the glorious cocktail menu (although a bottle of rosé was second best). While visiting my sisters in the area, we stopped into Soul and feasted on tapas after stopping next door for a drink. Starting with the coconut shrimp ceviche with plantain chips, we moved on to the  fried brussels, Southern fried oysters, and bone marrow - all were absolutely fabulous. Despite the wait to be seated, our service was SO quick and efficient (much appreciated). Such a wonderful experience overall - would return in a heartbeat!),(I love a good tapas bar because it means the portions are small, prices are decent and I can try many different things! Well, that's just what my date and I did! The place is upstairs and you walk in through the patio which is covered in the winter time, heated though. You walk in and the lighting is low, music is energetic and are greeted right away! We used the Yelp application to get on the wait-list and was sat almost right when we walked in. The exposed brick of the restaurant combined with the unique lighting was very appealing. Marlon was our server and he was INCREDIBLE. Well-spoken, knew the menu, made great suggestions and held great conversation. My date and I started off with the Godzilla Roll and Cheese Panini. Both very tasty. I then ordered the Lamb Skewer and she ordered the Mini Burgers. 3rd round consisted of Piquillo Pepper Toasts and Gyro Skewer. Everything was so good, my least favorite was the Gyro Skewer... it was just meat on a stick and a bit dry. My favorite... oh man. Those Lamb Skewers were incredible. I'd order like 30 of them as appetizer, meal AND dessert. They were so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely come back here!),(So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.

That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch. 

I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits. 

Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)

I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too.

We sampled the oysters which were perfectly fried. The ham plate was filled with tasty choices and the truffle fries and baconed Brussel sprouts were exceptional. Minor note would be toasts are dry and too many of them are a downer as is the pounding techno beat. Achieve hipster haven at a lower decibel),(What a great find this place is Located in the hot trending Uptown area of Charlotte

The walk up the staircase to the second floor balcony reminded me of the French quarter in New Orleans. It was about 9:30 pm on a Tuesday and the place was packed! I liked the dimly lit and dark wood ambience. A well stocked bar, decent wine and sake list

We sat and dined at the bar. The menu is very gastro pub eclectic with things from sushi to a Korean take on wings to ramen with goat cheese balls to ahi tacos to pork belly with watermelon tacos. 

The thing is everything is really good

It was now about 11 pm and the place was getting even busier and the music playing from the DJ was getting a little louder and better. 

I kept thinking how much I was enjoying this place and the food and if I lived in Charlotte I would be here quite often

Maybe it's the best Thai in Charlotte, maybe it isn't. But one thing it absolutely is is consistent. They have a half dozen lunch specials that are inexpensive, served fast and served tasty. Red or green curry, pad thai and some other things that I never order because the pad thai is just excellent.

When you order, the heat is measured from ""0 stars"" (no heat at all) to ""5 stars"" (should be served with a fire extinguisher). Remember to ask for ""fresh peppers"" instead of the dried peppers which doesn't change the level of heat but does change the flavor a bit. Depending on mood, I'm having either two stars or three stars and that's plenty hot for me.

One of these days, I'll land here outside of lunch hours. It hasn't happened yet.

Same great folks, consistently great Thai food. Thai Taste is very good.

(Do stop by their neighbor, Paper Skyscraper!)),(Picture it. Thursday. Noon. All of Charlotte has descended on this small restaurant on East Blvd. Seriously, I think everyone in a 50 mile radius decided to have lunch here yesterday. Despite the mad rush, we waited only a few minutes to get a table.

I love any place that will immediately bring me a bowl of soup after I am seated. It's like a hug. So comforting and soothing.

The lunch specials are a little limited, but all the basics are there. I went with my usual: Shrimp Pad Thai. It comes with a spring roll and yummy dipping sauce. For me, the portion size is big enough to split into two meals. I always have leftovers to take home... no matter how hungry I am.

I got a water and a Coke, but was super jealous when they brought my friend's iced tea. It came with a pitcher of iced tea as well. I guess it's best soda doesn't come in a pitcher... although, that's probably every dentist's dream. Paging Dr. Cavity.

Dine in or take out... Thai Taste is a great place to grab food. Service is always on point... even when it's crazy busy. The people here are super nice. Never had a bad experience here. And to be honest, I don't know anyone who has. Keep up the good work Thai Taste.),(My Thai-craving days have ceased to be numbered and Thai Taste came up on my radar for a lunch visit with a buddy this week. Happily obliged an early lunch and we certainly beat the impending crowd that tends to form right around lunchtime proper. 

The lunch menu is very quaint. About 7 options that can all be tailored for choice of protein, veggies, level of spice and other accoutrement. Variations of pad thai, soups. rice dishes and mixed veggies. I settled on the pad thai and was thrilled with the result. Baby bok choy, bean sprouts, rice noodles, a spring roll and a delectable dipping sauce. It's a hefty portion for such a cheap lunch, too. I went with 2-star spice and was happy I did. It cleared my sinus cavity with ease. 

My #1 recommendation: order the hot tea. Especially on a cold day. It's a simple oolong\/citrus tea that works so well with the food. I'm stoked to come back and order the tea again. 

The service is super friendly, fast, and fun. They were attentive throughout our meal. 

Though the menu isn't vast for lunch, I'd like to come back in for dinner sometime soon. 

Cheer, Thai Taste!),(Spring Rolls - Needed more shrimp and less noodles. The dipping sauce was good though. $3.95 for 2, wouldn't say its worth it.

Chicken Pad Thai - Kinda small for $12, but the noodles are well cooked. Wish there was less sauce. I would come back for this for lunch.

Pad See Ew - The noodles aren't as delicate as I am used to. The flavor was good though. Maybe it'd be more worthwhile for lunch. 

Excellent service, they even ran out to the parking lot to give me the take out boxes that I forgot at the table!),(I have been in CLT for seven years, I went to Thai Taste numerous times and loved it.  Then I went one time and wasn't too impressed, so I kind of wrote it off.  I went last night and ordered C-3 (red curry chicken with pineapple.) Come on you didn't know what C-3 was????  I  ordered it level 3 spicy out of 5.  It was perfect.  Sometimes dishes are never spicy enough.  I woke up this morning thinking maybe I should have my leftovers for breakfast.)"

There is nothing to rave about -- it's a standard chain cafe. But free WIFI, which is wonderful. I tried the broccoli and cheddar soup and was sad to see clumps of un-melted cheddar in the soup. And it was just warm, not hot. 

I also ordered a BLT. There is no BLT on the menu, but the staff was pleased to make one for me, which I very much appreciated. Thus, it's hard to confess that the sandwich just was not that good.

I've been coming here for almost 11 years. My seven year old fake nephew loves this place. He's a real kid, we're just not actually related. This is what happens when you're my age and all your friends have kids. You become Aunt Nikki. And I love every minute about it.

There's nothing fancy here. It's not the best food on the planet. It's an old-school, Charlotte institutions serving up burgers, dogs and fries since 1926. Order at the counter then walk over to pay at the register. There are booths and stools with a lunch counter. Ketchup, Texas Pete, and napkins are on all the tables.

You can't beat the prices. Three adults and a child we spent $29 on lunch today. The kid had a hot dog and fries, the adults had three grilled cheeses, three chili dogs, a cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. Yes, we're those people. Add on a couple drinks and that's quite a meal for less than 30 bucks.

They do breakfast here. There's a Green's lunch cart over at the Wells Fargo Plaza. They also offer catering. 

Things to know:
1) They have the good ice
2) Free WiFi
3) Skip the parking lots around it. Look for street parking at the meters on Poplar. Download the Parkmobile app and it's as easy as scanning the meter to pay.
4) Romare Bearden is right across the street. Go for a walk in the park afterwards or let the kids play. We usually take the seven year old over before or after lunch to play catch or kickball.

Which Wich has an array of pre-stamped paper bags which you are to mark your sandwich type and toppings. All 'wiches are toasted, btw. I chose the turkey on wheat with pesto, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mozzarella. 

Now, my sandwich was good but not great and it's mostly my fault. I probably shouldn't have gone with the pesto as it was a little too overwhelming with the dainty turkey. I tried hubs' beef cheesteak and it was really, really good. I may get that next time around. I, like Jason L, was blown away by the myriad of options here.

That's how I feel about Sean. 

I don't buy a ton of seafood to cook for myself. Sometimes I find fresh fish counters intimidating. Not here. I can walk in completely clueless, and leave happy. Everyone here is nice and helpful. I feel like Sean knows fish like I know Friends sitcom trivia. (Aka that means he's a certified expert)

Along with fresh offerings of their own, Catch On also supports local businesses and carries products from others. I think one of the coolest things they do here is Taco Tuesday. The kits make 6 tacos. They come with tortillas hand made locally at La Lupita, house made fresh salsa from Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant, taco seasoning from The Savory Spice Shop, mahi mahi, slaw, an avocado, and a lime. Kit is just $16. Steal. You could probably have dinner ready in 10 minutes. 

Yes, this is going to be a little more pricier than your Harris Teeter. But, it's better quality and still comparable and even better priced than a lot of the other seafood places around town. Keep up the good work Sean and crew. Love having you guys just five minutes down the road from my house.)"

Not that the cupcakes we had were stale or anything, but near closing, the cupcake selection dwindles and the frosting looks a little like it's been sitting out for too long.

I've long been wanting to visit FuManChu Cupcakes for the longest time, after seeing rave reviews of it online.  Because I'm allergic to alcohol, I opted to try one of their non-alcoholic cupcakes.  I got the sea salt caramel cupcake, for my love of caramel and sea salt.  The cupcake was slightly disappointing in that it was basically all frosting and caramel and hardly any cake.  It was also on the very sweet side, so if you have a major sweet tooth, this place is for you.  The cake could have been a little more moist, as well.   The cupcake overall was just okay for me - I probably would not crave it and at $4, it's higher priced than even cupcakes in NYC.

My friend had the white russian and said it she couldn't taste any of the alcohol - not sure if it's supposed to.

I like that FuManChu has unique flavors, especially for the lovers of liquor out there, but I've just had better tasting cupcakes that are more ""blow-your-mind"" elsewhere.  Definitely worth at least one visit though.),(Ever have sausage in a cupcake? How about Sriracha? Well, if you haven't, enter FuManChu Cupcakes. This awesome biz bakes up some incredibly cupcakes of all varieties - as owner Andy likes to say, calm to crazy. 

You can order up flavors like Irish Car Bomb, French Toast (complete with Neesie's sausage), White Russian, and Strawberry Lemonade. I personally adore the French Toast variety and completely commend the use of meat within a sweet treat. It's bold and awesome. And if you're not a meat lover, you can rely on the fact that many of the FuManChu cupcakes are made with booze. Nice. 

If you're looking to try a really different take on a cupcake, give FuManChu a call and order up!)"

I dutifully checked in to Great Harvest and entered the store to see if there were any bread loaves and sweet treats I could buy after shopping at TJ's.

One of them asked if she could help me and readily obliged when I asked to see the book of ingredients so that I may know which non-allergenic varieties I could take home with me.

I popped out to Saffron for dinner. Two chicken curries, a saag aloo and riata with a garlic naan made it home. The portions were reasonable with a good amount of chicken in each of the curries and plenty of sauce. Each also had a tub of excellent jasmine rice. Yum.

Naan was excellent but one order for two people wasn't enough. Next time, two orders!),(Saffron is good because they refill the food often so it stays warm and fresh. Also, the service is very friendly and they keep their restaurant clean. The naan was pretty good, and I loved the tandoori chicken, but I wish there was more variety in general and more spicy options.

What I didn't like was the arrangement of the buffet. Way too cramped especially when I am rushing to eat my plate full of food! Also, the table they sat us at was terrible for buffet-ing because it was a booth and hard to get in and out. They need more veggies.

Overall it was a good experience. Recommended for the $8.95 lunch buffet!),(I met four friends tonight at Saffron, we ordered lots of food and ate family style, it was fine, I wasn't in love, but I certainly didn't hate it.

I suppose if you're really desperate to pick someone up this would be a suitable place to go, as the plethora of people coming in the door never seems to stop.

After she carefully went over the different options I settled on a small pineapple\/coconut boba.  The tea was amazingly cold and delightfully refreshing.  Not too sweet...  A unique taste that I loved.   I liked that each tea was made fresh to order, and the way they sealed the top of the cup so no spills!  The wide straws were novel and just right for consuming this drink.  The first few sips were great, until it just wasn't anymore.  

There were so, so many boba that it interfered with the enjoyment of the drink.  At one point the boba seemed to be replicating itself.  

With each sip this experience morphed into a high-end drink nightmare!  The boba tasted like chewy pebbles of goo that expanded in my stomach.   It caused my stomach to ache.  I began discarding the boba into a napkin until I finally gave up and tossed the entire drink out.  I didn't even have 1\/3 of it.  I felt wasteful but really...  No treat should be this much work!  

Five dollars directly in the trash.

The rest of the store is similar in this low cost vein. Most items are barely out of their shopping boxes and are displayed on pallets and shelves. There is very little help - typically a manager, a stocker and one or two cashiers. All part of the low cost atmosphere.

The validation machine is located on a shelf to the left side of Bonsai Sushi Fusion. Just stick your ticket in and go. TWSS. Warning: validation is only good for 90 minutes of free parking.

Pure Pizza: farm to fork concept. The chorizo will change your life.
Viva Raw: fresh pressed juices. Not sure which one you'll like? They'll let you sample to see! The beet juice is my favorite.
Tank's Tap: great selection of local beers.
Local Loaf: lunch or brunch, they're both delicious. Try the signature chicken and the egg or the biscuits and gravy.
Bonsai Sushi Fusion: super creative rolls, including a sushi burrito.

I could go on forever. There's not a bad vendor here. Assorted Table Wine Shop, Orrman's Cheese Shop, Hazelnut's Creperie, Cloud 9 Confections and more. You can even get amazing treats from barChocolate. I highly recommend the ghost chili ones. They are so unique and delicious. 

I am so happy that uptown not only has such a great market like this, but they put a lot of support into it.

For those of you hesitant about parking, fear not. Parking is validated for up to 90 minutes at 7th Street Station parking garage!

It happens all the time! Though entertaining, and somewhat humorous, just make sure you actually read the signs on the door(s).

Wifi can be a bit of a problem. I'm not always sure of the situation, but ask one of the biz owners and they may be able to help if you can't connect. Plenty of plugs on the floor for laptops\/phones, however.

Decided to give Rebecca's Taste of the South a try today and I've always liked Soul Food. Charlotte is fortunate to have several great ones but alas this is not one of them.

It's a very attractive restaurant located in a former Sportsbar and it's got a nice clean feel. The service here is great and between the hostess and our server, we did not lack for anything the whole time we were there.

One point on the atmosphere however as a word of caution. On first glance, each table has a small bowl of what at first glance appears to be nuts or trail mix but it's really dried beans as decoration. Not paying attention, both my wife and I took a bite and found out they were just decorations.

What we had was not what I would call Soul Food. It's been Americanized to the main stream that about the only thing left of the menu that resembles Soul Food is the Collards cooked with Pork. They do have Chicken and Waffles but that dish came out of NY and not the South.

We started with Fried Green Tomatoes which is a favorite.Came out nice big slices that looked great but when we ate them, what we found was green tomatoes cut micro thin in a very thick batter and fried. Green Tomatoes has a natural tartness and there was so little of it in each slice, that all you could taste was the breading.

I ordered the two piece fried chicken, white meat and got a breast and a wing. Last time I checked, a wing was not considered white meat.  The Mustard Potato Salad was good but with a little too much mayonnaise to the point that in was beginning to get runny. Prefer mine with a nice crunchy texture but the flavor balance was good otherwise.  

The BBQ beans appeared to be straight out of a can with no distinct flavor other that a heavy molasses.

My wife a bit better experience with a Chicken Cheese steak and Fried Okra but  with the exception of the Fried Okra, not exactly what I would call either Southern or Soul.

Could be a good restaurant because the atmosphere and service is here but the menu and the execution needs a total correction.)"

With not much time spent in the Freemore area on Sundays, usually due to the heavy traffic for Panthers games, we decided to brave the crowds. We were delighted to find a parking space right in front, a rather open seating arrangement, and only a few people there pre-game. We walked right up, placed our order, and grabbed a comfy half booth on the wall. 

I decided on the stuffed burger Buffalo style. It was great. I'm not one to go for beef, but this sounded too good to pass up. The burger was stuffed with cheese (of which variety I'm not certain), topped with buffalo sauce and celery and a side of tots. It was awesome. The burger wasn't massive, easy to handle and was perfectly messy. I was in love. The tots on the side....just textbook perfect. Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy and the right amount of soft interior that your palate beckons for. The sweet potato tots....not so much. I'm not typically a fan, but these were a little lackluster. 

The service was a bit odd, too. Lots of people standing around and it did take a little while for our food to arrive. However, I say it was worth the wait. The entire menu didn't look all that impressive or unique, but I think I hit the money spot with the stuffed burger. Plus, I'm a sucker for buffalo sauce. 

The space is rad. Very open, but with far too many televisions for my liking. Great for a gather, game day, etc. Also, they have two killer patios. Hello, summer. 

I can say I'd be back, but not sure I could say I'd venture outside of my previous order.),(I've waited an awful long time to visit The Burger Co. - and I'm not sure why? So, here's the deal...

In a sea of pretty damn tasty burger joints, The Burger Co. fits right in the middle for me. It's good, but it's not great. 

The Good: It's a nice looking place on the inside - I'd like to see it filled up before Panthers games, but the Panthers would actually have to be good, first. Other good things...they grind their meat fresh daily - I could tell as my burger wasn't the typical round frozen patty. It was a fresh patty smothered in cheddar cheese with my choice of toppings. For $5, the burger was pretty filling. They have a large variety of burgers, a few, salads, and a nice selection of sides. Staff were extremely friendly and laid back, which works well with this order & deliver concept. Don't expect waiters\/waitresses here, but they do have a full bar with some decent drink specials. Nom.

The Meh: Your burger doesn't come with a side, which isn't too bad considering the burgers are pretty affordable. I ordered the sweet potato tots, and they were just a little sweet for me. They were off the charts sweet with the coagulated cinnamon sugar butter that came with them. I'll pass on that next time. However, the tots were perfectly cooked and crispy. And while my burger was tasty, it could have used a more flavor or some type of magical schmear on the bun. 

Overall, it was a good burger - but this place is now in competition with a handful of really great burger joints. Here's hoping they turn out some delicious bites to fend off that fierce competition.),(There was something holding me back from visiting the Burger Company, I can't quite explain it.  I thumbed through my Citypass coupon book and noticed a coupon.  Hmmmmmmm. well, ok.

We walk in, it has an open, industrial feel. Three greetings from servers, you can walk to the counter and order or full service at the bar. You know where I sat.
Tuesday $2.25 bottled beers, I ordered a turkey burger add jalapenos.  My turkey burger was DELICIOUS. It was moist and juicy, seasoned perfectly, it was oversized sticking out of my perfectly buttered grilled roll.   I would drive there just to eat the turkey burger again.

French Fry Barometer = HOT),(I like Burger Company. I go to Law School down the street (and because of Burger Company's proximity to campus and because there aren't a ton of options nearby), I'm no stranger to it. In fact, I can honestly say that my first year I probably went to Burger Company (AT LEAST) once a week, and usually more than that. 

What I like about it: They're fast. Your meal gets to you quickly, even on a busy day. The food options are really good too. I've tried a number of different burgers, the chicken sandwich, the wings, appetizers, salads, and I've never been disappointed with the flavor. And unlike some of the other reviews that I've read, I don't really consider their burgers to be pricey. The bar is pretty cool too. They have some nice drink specials and a pretty good selection. The waitstaff is always very friendly.

Not to be picky, but the one thing that I noticed is that when my classmates and I have gone, on a number of occasions our tater tots have been cold and once even (almost) frozen. And sometimes when it gets busy a burger will be missing something important like chili (which happened a couple of times as well). It's just that attention to detail that is keeping me from giving it a 4 or 5 star rating, but it's close. I would give it a 3.5+ if I had the option.

But overall I would definitely come back here again and again even if it wasn't right down the road from school. Overall the food is really tasty here.)"

I opted for one of their skirt steak dinners, which arrived accompanied by a few plantains and two scoops of very tasty rice. Not a huge meal, but a decent portion. The steak was cooked perfectly, though the steak knife was appreciated. It was melt-in-your-mouth though not cut-with-a-fork. Great flavor with some spices but also the taste of the grill.

Service is excellent at keeping drinks refilled, clearing dirty dishes and generally staying on top of things without being annoying.

As we were leaving, the live music was getting set up. I understand that they also do some salsa dancing here. This place would be a perfect date night.),(FInally had a chance to check out this place. I'm a large proponent of Cuban cuisine and had put off trying this place for far too long. It's a trek from where we live in Dilworth, but I'd say it's damn worth it. Located off of South Tryon past Carowinds, It's in a small shopping center, but as it's own building. 

We stopped in on a Saturday night and we were greeted with live music. It was awesome. The guy was singing his heart out and I'm happy to say that he was really good. It wasn't unpleasant at all. Actually added to the ambiance.

We started out with the avocado dip (basically guac) with fried plantains. Dude. I'd highly recommend getting this. The dip is pretty commonplace with other guac varieties, but the fried plantains make for a really nice change-up from plain corn chips. We cleaned the plate between the three of us. 

I went with the Cuban sandwich. I have to order it any time it's offered at a Cuban place. Happy to report it's a textbook sandwich. Flaky Cuban bread, yellow mustard, Swiss, pork, ham, dill pickles. That's all you need. Ordered it with a side of tostones. Mashed, and fried plantains served with ""mojo."" Basically an oily, garlic-y dipping sauce. It's amazing. Super mild and a nice touch.

We also ordered a couple of the gin mojitos. Have to give these a big ""meh."" It's a great idea, but the grenadine really killed the flavors. It was just too heavy.

Service was incredibly friendly and cordial. The place was packed and the guys on the floor took care of everyone with a smile.

I always get my usual: the Italian Night Club. I can't ever remember what it's called... so I usually call it the Italian Nigh Job. Pretty sure that's something wayyyy different.

The smells of the bread definitely make up and down most of 3rd street and onto Tryon and Church. The staff is super friendly and they whoop up a sandwich in no time flat. Also, the bike delivery in uptown is solid. Called and it was ready less than 10 minutes after. 

Not that I'm an avid Jimmy John's goer, but the Unwich is delicious. Lettuce wrap instead of bread. I got the veggie option with sprouts, guac, peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Definitely fresh and refreshing. Great for a quick lunch on the go. I dig that they make the wrap easy to eat whilst walking.

We had reservations and arrived promptly at our time only to be told our table wasn't ready.  We sat down at in the bar area, per there request only to starting giving drinks orders and were told our table was ready...hmmm.

I asked for a great table with a great view....and they definitely delivered.  I also requested a special birthday cake for someone in our party and they did deliver, but their timing was WAY off.  Both ladies left for the Ladies room and THEN they delivered it with just us 2 guys sitting there.......what the hell where they thinking?  I mean it was complimentary..thanks...but if you are going to flub the delivery...forget it.

Add in they didn't tell us anything was 86's (no longer in stock or sold out) they in turn waited for us to order it and then tell us? Hmmmm....for all the hype this place has it was landing flat with me and my guests.

Food was slow to arrive and the waiters\/servers all seemed a bit overwhelmed.  My dish was very good as was my GF.  Wine was also very good.

We wanted to get additional drinks, but our waiter was running all over the place with a pitcher full of something never once looking at our table.

Bathroom are a haul from the dinning area.

All and all considering I dropped $200+ for 2 people, I thought the food was very good and the service and birthday surprise was a total flop.  

I won't be....for any reason, coming back here again.  Just too damn expensive to ""experiment"" and see if it was just a fluke or a bad night....I think I'll just continue to go to places like BLT or Capital Grill as they have both great food AND great service.   Good bye Bentley's...parting is such sweet sorrow....and to be perfectly honest too damn expensive for what I got...or could get in the future.),(Great view. (insert sounds of crickets chirping here) 

But that's about it. Bentley's really didn't impress me the other night. 

When we got there- the hostess asked us to take a seat in the bar as our table wasn't ready. Okay. So we sit in the stylish bar in front of the fireplace and a woman comes over to take our drink order. At that point the hostess came and got us for the table and the server basically never got us our drinks. In most fine dining restaurants- once the drink order is taken, it doesn't matter if you drink them in the bar or the restaurant; they take them to where you are. But not the case here. So we never got that first drink. 

That was the first service mis step of the night. The rest of the service errors were due to the server who we had (or didn't have, as the case may be, as this guy was missing in action for most of our VERY long dinner). 

We were celebrating a birthday and had asked for a window table for this occasion. We were seated in the perfect table- right on the edge of the window looking out over downtown Charlotte. This was off to be a great night. Or so I thought. 

Our server came over with a couple of bottles of champagne to tempt us but we were in the wine and cocktail mood so we passed on the champagne. Maybe that was our mistake as this guy didn't come back to our table to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. 

No drinks. No bread refresh. No fresh ground pepper (other tables had it) No service. Where is all this ""southern hospitality"" that my friends down here talk to me about? Not at Bentley's on this Thursday night, that's for sure. 

We placed our order. Too bad for me that they didn't have Grouper on this night although it was printed on the menu (my fav) but had instead substituted Mahi Mahi in for it. No thanks. I went with surf and turf with a filet and crab along with a salad to start. 

My friend ordered escargot to start and this same server tried to talk him out of it saying it would take 20 minutes to prepare. "" Hey!"", thought I. ""The man wants snails . . .give him snails!"" Don't try to talk him out of it. So the rest of our appetizers came up with the snails and were quite good. 

There might have been a pacing problem in the kitchen as our entrees then took forever to come out. And when they did, other than the sides coming out piece meal, the food was pretty good- although there was gravy over my filet when I had ordered it with Bearnaise sauce. Also-there were only 2 melted butters brought out to the table- when clearly 3 of us were having lobster or crab. 

At this point- our dinner was going on the 2.5 hour point and we were meeting others and had to go. However- we knew there was a special birthday dessert coming out but again . . .it was taking forever. When it finally came out, we had a forkful and then practically ran out of the door. 

Dinner for 4 ran about $400 which would have been reasonable for a fine dining restaurant, had we gotten a fine dining experience. 

An off night? I don't know. This server really blew it. And at that price? I am sure there are better choices in Charlotte.)"

The only gripe with this location is the entrance\/exit. Good luck getting back onto 51 if traffic is heavy. Near impossible to make a quick turn and head towards 485\/Park Rd.

I had to bring Jon B here for lunch to pop his Whooli's cherry. Our order: a dozen wings (garlic parm and buffalo), a chicken philly, the special Whooli burger, homemade chips, and fries. It was all delicious. I'll tell you right now, that burger is one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Warning: it's a 1\/2 lb and two patties. Next time, I'll see if I can do a baby Whooli version of it. Loved how the fries came in a little basket. Also, in case you were wondering, this was in fact way too much food for us. However, it was worth every calorie and being stuffed all day. I'm also a big fan of the Whooli's Special (it's like an Italian type sub). All the food I've had here has been pretty solid.

We ordered four rolls with a soup and a seaweed salad to start. The soup and salad arrived swiftly and we had plenty of time to enjoy them before our rolls arrived. (Yes, she asked if it was okay that all four were on one plate.)

The rolls were tasty and fresh. Nicely arranged, nicely topped. Very nice.

A good amount of sushi and while the prices were a little higher than I'd usually go for, it was good. I would return.),(I don't typically make it down to this area of town, but since I was in the neighborhood I decided to give Wild East a try...and I was impressed! 

The short and skinny:

Ambiance: Don't let the boring exterior fool you, Wile East looks quite zen inside! There's a smattering of tables and booths and pretty good looking bar...all super duper clean.

Service: Very attentive, efficient and kind. My server even gave great recommendations right off the bat. Plus, my lunch came out lightening fast. 

Food: I ordered a side salad with ginger dressing ($3) and the Kamikaze roll ($12). The salad was pretty typical but the Kamikaze roll was drool worthy - spicy crunchy tuna and salmon stuffed with bits of cilantro and jalapeno covered in rice and topped with spicy crunchy shrimp and kani (crab). The roll said avocado, too, but I didn't spy any on my roll. Out of season, perhaps? Regardless, it was super fresh, filling and delicious. 

Next time I'm even near this area, I will definitely stop by Wild East again and sample some more deliciousness!)"

My wife is an UK import and she gives Big Ben the thumbs up.

Ordering from the dinner menu, we started off with a Scotch Egg (a boiled egg encased in a sausage wrapper then briefly fried) which was served with English relish. After that was cleared, our dinner arrived. I had a cottage pie, which was excellent. Plenty of meat and vegetables and actual (not from packet) mashed potatoes. My wife enjoyed the lamb dinner, which was a medium size pile of sliced lamb with steamed veggies and potatoes, covered in a zingy brown gravy. (On previous visits, I found the chicken curry to be very flavorful and not too spicy.)

Desserts were the only place where Big Ben lets it down. The Sherry Trifle was labeled as ""traditional"" but it seemed to be mostly canned whipped cream with very few lady's fingers. It was way too sweet and we ended up sending it back.

For two, with one appetizer, two entrees, three beers (one domestic, two imports) and a dessert, our tab was $70. While the food and service was great, this seems a little on the high side.

On some nights, they have music in the downstairs lounge. Even with the door closed, the smoke comes up from there as well as too much of the loud music. If that bothers you, try sitting on the other side of the restaurant. There's also a full bar if you just want drinks and (warning: English ahead) crisps.

They have a small parking behind the place and you're not supposed to park on the street. Overflow parking is across the street and down the hill, next to the Bank of America. It's clearly labeled but I think it could use a bit more lighting at night.

All told, a four star place. When we want to eat English, we're here!),(Great bar - I never made it to the first location of Big Ben's and always wanted to stop in...I'm loving the new place though.  The food is great for bar fare and the service was spot on.  I will always remember Big Ben's as my first and only experience with the ""Spotted Dick"" umm not  a fan of this dessert but it was worth a try.  Great place to meet some friends after work, and a decent outside patio once Spring finally arrives :)),(As a bar, it's great but the food and atmosphere needed help.

After the Yelp Get Lucky event tonight, my wife and I stopped at Big Ben's for a light meal.  We ended up being seated away from the musicians which consisted of an electric guitar and a bass but even at this distance, it was extremely loud, especially couple with a roudy group in the bar which was a few feet away.Sometimes musicians are under the impression that if loud is good, louder is better. Not necessarily the case and it was definately true this evening.

We could not hear our server so we had to point out our order. I had the haddock sandwich with steak fries and sweet tea.  My wife had a black and blue steak salad.  She loved her's but mine was lacking. The haddock had a mealy texture to it with little taste. The Steak Fries were under cooked and raw in the middle.

Maybe an off night because I've dined here several times over the years and had generally enjoyed it. Not the case tonight. Maybe next time I hope because in generally I enjoy the menu and it's one of the few places where you can go and consistently watch soccer. Service has always been good here.),(So, the light rail provides a nice way to visit the Southend without worrying about have too much fun and getting behind the wheel.

So a little walk from the place and a quick ride to the stop just a short walk to the pub makes this a nice little get away from the center city.

For this particular evening it was Tuesday night pub quiz and we sat outside to get away from it.  Unfortunately, they blasted it on the speakers outside so that was a real disappointment.  It was great to see the place packed on a Tuesday night, but not everyone was there to hear the guy tell cheese jokes as he moved through the trivia questions.

We has an appetizer and a few beers (which were discounted this evening) so all and all a nice night and a nice price at a nice place.)"

Though a chain, this is our sole Mama Fu's entity here in Crown Town. There used to whispers of another location, but this one is sailing solo with Asian fare to keep your lunch or dinner needs satiated. Doesn't really keep the feel of a chain, if you ask me. 

My favorites --

Obviously the lettuce wraps. Simple flavors, finely chopped chicken, generous portions of iceberg lettuce, and a fantastic hoisin\/ponzu\/soy sauce. Great for dipping....or dousing. 

Spicy General Fu. Just what you need or want in the spicy department. Goodness gracious, look out though. It'll light you up if you're not careful. 

Veggie Lo Mein. Simple. Easy. Yum. Can I have some more. Yes. Please. Thank you. 

Rare Tuna appetizer. Don't recall the proper name, but I'd eat this any day. It's always fresh and works great as an app or a smaller entree for one person. 

Been coming here for quite some time and Bridgett, manager, is one of the nicest souls you'll ever come to meet. She's cordial, bright, and simply a joy to be around. 

Also, in warmer climes, the patio is great for a sunny lunch.

Inside Mama's is bright and colorful with ample table space and even a comfy booth if you're waiting for your food to go. Employees are all very sweet, smiley and helpful. It's especially nice to see how many regulars they have here! I noticed the manager greeting many of them by first name. Sweet! 

Items you must try:

Basil spring rolls: 4\/5: Very fresh and healthy rolls accompanied by great peanut sauce. 

Lettuce wraps: 5\/5: I have so many friends that swear by PF Changs' lettuce wraps but these would challenge them! Flavorful chicken diced with a myriad of spices envelopes in a large piece of lettuce. That's what dreams are made of, friends. 

Special crunchy noodle dish: 3\/5: This dish was a special for the evening - a mammoth portion of crunchy (fried? sautéed?) noodles with carrots, snap peas and chicken. The flavors were well rounded and I loved the idea of a crunchy noodle. The issue on this one was the carry out as the sauce took much away from the crunch as I traveled home. Regardless, I would definitely order this again if I was eating in house!

I thought I would just pop in for a nice and light meal, making a healthy choice for a late breakfast. It's a ""bistro"" so they should have light stuff, right?

Well, it turns out that on Sunday, Bistro La Bon does a huge spread for a brunch buffet. And since I simply can't resist a buffet, I ended up ""forgetting"" my plan for a light meal and ended up stuffing my face with a couple plates of absolutely excellent food.

I don't know if they rotate out the meals, so your spread might be different. I had hand-rolled mozzarella, Swedish meatballs, beef brisket (a little salty, but tender), smoked salmon, hand-made sliced ciabbata bread, yummy potato salad and a pile of Caesar salad. Oh, but there's more. In the kitchen, they hide the hot foods and they are all included with your buffet. So I also had some scrambled eggs (fluffy!) and bacon, a chocolate waffle (I only had half) and the topper, a slice of French toast that was topped with real (not canned!) whipped cream and powdered sugar and syrup.

So much for light, eh?

I opted to sit at the bar and so I had excellent service. A really good deal at $24 or so with tip.),(This is one of those places that I feel like doesn't get as much love as it should. Maybe it's because in a sketchy looking strip mall? Everyone, repeat after me: strip malls are our friends. They are home to some of Charlotte's most amazing gems. 

Food-wise, I've had almost the entire menu. Well excluding brunch, I haven't been here yet for that. If I'm solo for lunch, I'll get the crab cakes & salad. If I'm with a group, I love to get as many plates to share. The Swedish Meatballs are incredible. Chef Majid learned his craft working in some of Sweden's best kitchens. I love the grilled octopus with the ratatouille and citrus aioli. The crispy avocado & asparagus is exactly how it sounds. Simple, but delicious. The fried brussels, the spicy shrimp and chorizo, mussels, lavender chicken, lamb lollipops-- all great. I'll stop before I end up writing the entire menu on here. 

My hands down favorite cocktail is the Jalapeno Basil Martini. I get every time. Thursdays, half price select bottles of wine. Sundays, $3 Mimosas and $4 House Bloody Mary's. 

I love the quirky vibes and atmosphere. Great spot for date night, girls night, meeting. Nice little bar and patio areas. You can even make a reservation right here on Yelp.),(Can't believe it's taken me this long to check out Bistro La Bon for brunch. I remember see this place come to the odd strip mall and thought it would never amount to nothing. I am pleasantly and utterly incorrect. Bistro La Bon is a culinary force to be reckoned with and has earned every bit of my palate's attention. 

First of all, these guys are making their own bread every day. For everything. making baguettes and brioche isn't easy to do when you have a shining menu to go along with it. It's labor intensive and has to be done right. Happy to say these guys deliver hand over fist with flavor. 

Love the decor, too. It's not to stuffy like some other French restaurants. It's small-ish, but the bar can seat quite a few people. Also, the waiting area is ridiculously comfortable. Try not to fall asleep here on a Sunday afternoon. Or do. 

Brunch is just amazing. Swedish meatballs, brisket, au gratin potatoes, salad, plenty of bread, chocolate waffles, eggs, bacon, and..... dun dun dun....the best freaking brioche french toast I've ever had in my entire life. This french toast is perfect. Simply perfect. Not overtly sweet. Just enough sweet\/fermenty taste of brioche, modest amount of syrup, homemade whipped cream. It's grilled on the flat top with just the right amount of charred bits. Goodness. Save room for these as they can be ordered from your server. Get ready to eat a baker's dozen. 

The service is fantastic. Knowledgeable and friendly. All you need. 

For $18 a head, I have to say this rivals brunch from many other places in town. I've heard it can be hard to get a seat at peak brunching hours. We made it in at 130pm and didn't have a problem. 

I can't wait to go back.),(Bistro La Bon is at the top of my list of favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  As I was deciding on a place to take my sister for restaurant week I just really didn't want to be disappointed and though I would have liked to try somewhere new I just had a feeling that Bistro La Bon would be the place to go.  

What an amazing job they did for restaurant week I seriously don't have a single complaint.  The portions were huge and they did 4 courses not 3.  I started with the mussels (prob my favorite food) these mussels did not disappoint leeks and saffron in this amazing broth with plenty of bread to dip.  My sister ordered the eggplant and mozzarella app and that was also extremely tasty.  Next up a salad nothing special but fresh and delicious.  I ordered the salmon for my entree it was served with creamy wasabi mashed potatoes and bok choy.  I know I have mentioned this in my reviews before but you can't leave this place without having the bread pudding it's the best dessert I have ever had.  I have had the famous bread pudding at Commander's Palace in New Orleans and it has nothing on the bread pudding at Bistro La Bon recipe please?),(I may have to create a new list for places like Bistro La Bon...I think I may call it ""Nom Fest"" because I was in absolute heaven during their Sunday smorgasbord brunch. 

Oh my goodness oh my goodness...whether you favor gratins or chocolate waffles, lip-smacking french toast or creamy orzo salad, buttery brisket or delectable coconut macaroons, there is something for everybody here. And, honestly, this buffet (for $14.95 per person) is a pretty sweet deal any way you cut it. A few of the standouts in this tasty spread...

Macaroons: ZOMG. I was ready to open my purse and go all covert ops on the buffet to smuggle out a tray of these perfectly crafted coconut macaroons. No joke, they are some of the best I've ever had. 

French Toast: Buttery, velvety magic. Perfectly made with the right amount of syrup. Just an FYI - you'll have to order the chocolate waffles and this French toast with your server, even though it's included in the buffet price. 

Sweet Potato Gratin: It sounds as delicious as it tasted. My tastebuds were dancing a jig of massive proportions.

It is in the Family Dollar strip mall on Central Ave.  Could you ask for anything more sketchy? Talk about lock your doors when you get out of the car.
BUT.... When you walk in, it is like, oh, this is nice!  I sat at the bar and had a glass of prosecco and some mussels.  I want to go with a group of people, preferably my Yelp friends and order every appetizer on the menu. OK?  Can we go? Please and thank you.)"

Since then, Charlotte has gotten Publix and they've had to up their game. This Teeter has done that. It's still bright and clean and has smiling and friendly faces, asking if you're finding everything or if you need any help. It's a great shopping experience.

I like this store a lot. They have a nice deli, a huge frozen section and the cheese bunker is excellent. Beer and wine? Decent. There's rarely a queue at the checkout.

It's still a teeny parking lot.),(I'm a fan, but only moderately. I can't really say that I see this is ""my HT"" just yet. It works and has everything, per usual. The layout is a bit odd, and I do feel a bit congested near the entrance\/exit. Still enjoy the produce section of HT and find this one to be on par with others around town. 

Big plus for having a bike rack outside. Living less than a mile away, I'm prone to get around more on my bike. Working out at the Dowd and then utilizing the bike lanes on East to get home makes this an easy destination for small necessities or singular items for dinner(s). 

I can see this location becoming our regular spot in due time.),(A friend of mine astutely pointed out that it seems as if there are Harris Teeters on *almost* every corner in Charlotte. Well, maybe. But this HT falls squarely in the A-OK category for me. 

The good: A diverse selection of produce, meats, cheeses, seafood, cooking\/baking needs in a clean, easy to shop environment. They also carry the requisite amount of cleaning and paper products, too. Your VIC card can score some pretty sweet deals if you shop prudently. Plus, the staff & cashiers are typically helpful & friendly when you're searching for a random ingredient and walking around the store like a lost puppy. (me) 

The meh: Prices, especially for comparable produce, cheese and nuts and specialty products, are (IMO) significantly higher than Trader Joe's. Also, this place can be a total cluster-eff during the weekend or around the holiday. And lastly, the toiletry & bath products aisle is kinda sad. Just go to CVS - you'll save money & end up with a better array of choices. 

I'll continue to shop at this Teeter due to its location, but only for products that I can't find at the local farmer's market and TJ's.),(So for Thanksgiving 2011, the standard food items were needed and Harris Teeter came through with flying colors.  

I even needed a pan for the turkey as it seems the one we had didn't make it in the move.

They had it all and at a good price too.)"

I've enjoyed most every nook of this fountain-esque beer haven. Great outdoor seating, cozy inside seating and the bar is long and hospitable. Here's a tip: order the pretzel. Oh, man. I can't think of a better pairing of food\/beer. Salty, warm, chewy, soft pretzel with melty, melty cheese. Throw in a tall German beer and it's like being 21 all over again. What a treat.

I'm running behind and actually thought I had already posted this review but apparently I did not. Back in May, two of my friends from Ohio went to the 300 race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and had dinner here afterwards.

It's a nice place with good service and a somewhat whimsical menu.  Main selling point is their Saucer Club where you consume 200 different beers or ales and you get a Saucer with your name on it mounted on the walls or ceiling.  Considering the number of different bottled beers and ales and the broad selection on tap which changes weekly, not hard to have two hundred different one.

Food is a bit of an afterthough but what they do have is very good. I have the Reuben-esque, while my friends had a Saucer Dipster and the Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Sandwich sound plain but with the bacon, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, etc, is anything but

Room is like an old pub with the exception of the several hundred Saucers on the Walls and Ceiling from those who have come before and have been sucessful),(The best place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 ""pint nights"" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!

The glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.

The food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.

The one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.

One final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.),(Food: 2

I ordered the Monte cristo and it was pretty good but I don't know who could finish it;  I could only eat one section and my side of grits and had 3 leftover!  But it was tasty.  The grits were just ok howver. Wife had the club and she really enjoyed it.  Overall I'd say food was very good (5\/5)
We'll definitely come back and try other items from the extensive menu.),(A Definite Winner. Good Comfort Food and Breakfast all day

After having read a couple of reviews from folks I respect, I bookmarked this place and made it a destination.

We completed that journey today and it was more than worth the drive down from Cornelius.

Got there right at 11:30 am were told it would be a 20 minute wait which turned into more like 30.  No problem. They did their best to accommodate customers which made the wait worthwhile.

We got seated right at 12 noon.  Very expansive menu with something for everyone.

My wife ordered tea unsweetened while I asked for 1\/2 and 1\/2 and good thing I did. I hate to think what the regular sweet tea would have tasted like because the 1\/2 ans 1\/2 was more than sweet enough.

My wife ordered the Pittsburgh Salad which is a steak salad. What do you expect from someone from the Burgh.  She ordered the steak medium which is exactly how it was prepared. Size of the salad is beyond belief.

As for myself, i ordered the Meatloaf Plate which is two slices of Meatloaf with Brown  Gravy on top and a good serving of Mashed Potatoes and Sauted Vegetables

Meat Loaf was a bit dry but had good taste and texture otherwise. Mashed Potatoes were excellent and the Veggies were perfect with just the right amount of crunch.

Very friendly staff and we did not want for anything

It's a bit noisy so don't be surpised.

Several minor things but not enough to reduce this great dining experience to a lower rating.)"

Hubs and I dropped by to snag some treats to bring over to a friend's house. The very nice woman behind the counter led us through the different flavors and even let us sample a bit of their cheesecake (which was creamy dreamy deliciousness). Most cupcakes ranged from $2-$4 depending on flavor and size. We purchased a variety box of red velvet, carrot, turtle and devil's food cake. 

The red velvet cupcake was solid - albeit a bit dry. The cream cheese frosting was some of the best I've had, though, and that made up for the bit of dryness near the bottom of the cupcake. Our friends loved the carrot cake cupcake, too. I wasn't able to stick around to take stock in the rest of the cupcakes, but I have a feeling they were long gone within an hour. If you're looking for treats in the Ballantyne\/Blakeney area, Decadent Designs is a very solid choice.)"

We looked at the menu online so we'd know what to have. Unfortunately, the menu we had on this particular day didn't have the ""Mexican Toast"" so we had one order of the ""Smoked Salmon Tacos"" and one of the ""Carne Asada and Eggs"". The tacos were excellent - they had the right amount of salmon and a really good load of eggs and cheese. I especially enjoyed the steak and eggs. It was cooked well, the eggs were poached perfectly.

Parking is an irritant. If you're already in Uptown, hey, great. If not, expect to either drive around the block (yes, even on Sunday) or pay for a garage.),(I'm pretty sure every single review I've written this week has been about Mexican food. Maybe I need a chips and salsa intervention? Nahhhhhhh

I bounce between a few items here. The tuna tacos, the crab and shrimp enchiladas and my new fav- smoked salmon tacos. Smoked salmon tacos you ask.... why yes, this is in fact a brunch item. I never thought of Vida as a brunch place until I had these. All the brunch plates come with fruit and jalapeno potatoes. 

I'm a big fan of the salsa here. I love guac and queso, so sometimes I have a hard deciding which to order at a Mexican restaurant. When it comes to Vida, I go with the guac. Personal preference.

Now this is important, sit outside. IMO, Vida has the best patio for sight-seeing in uptown. And by sight-seeing, I of course mean people watching. Bubble (directly above it) also has a killer patio, but they don't have chips and salsa.

The Epicentre parking garage is a total rip-off. Unless you are heading to the movies (which validates), park anywhere else or take the lightrail here. There is an Epicentre stop. Parking on the street is free after 6pm. The Wake Forest deck (next to Fitzgerald's) is usually only five dollars. Fitz also validates that deck is you feel like popping in for a drink before you head home.),(I've been to Vida multiple times and seen all iterations of service here. Lunch, dinner, brunch, special events, during the DNC. It's a prime location in the EpiCentre with a killer patio and great mezzanine. Here's the breakdown:

Bar - Two. Upstairs and downstairs. Both have relatively the same offerings. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and make up a mean margarita. Most recently, we had some killer margaritas with Cointreau Noir -- much better than standard Grand Marnier. They have a decent selection of beers, but they stick to the Mexican food-centric bottles\/draughts. 

Food - Incredible guac. Let me rephrase that -- I'd eat a whole meal of guac and chips and be a happy camper. I've never had anything from Vida that I wouldn't get again. I will say that my favorite time to dine is now brunch on Sunday. Try the chilequiles and thank me later. *drops mic*

Only downside that I can really comment on is the unassociated parking situation for the EpiCentre. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah....WE KNOW, Ben,"" they exclaimed and clamored exhaustively. We all know it. We all hate it. It's expensive, validated parking isn't the norm, and so on. Just buck up and pay the piper. It's worth the meal. OR, find a spot on the street post 6pm or on the weekends when it's free as well.

Vida, thanks...for everything. I can haz guacamole?),(After reading all the reviews I was excited about trying this place.  We had a work event here the other night and I think it was the perfect spot for it.  They closed off the upstairs area and it was the perfect space for a small group to get together the bartender was awesome as well as the other waitstaff and I know my managers were very pleased with the whole experience.  They served light appetizers nothing that really made me go wow this is awesome but I really can't judge the food till I get a chance to sit down and check out the menu.  Margaritas were spot on  - looking forward to coming back soon.),(So finally I made it back to Vida after enjoying their soft opening a while back...ole! 

As others have mentioned - the decor is lovely. It's a well appointed restaurant with plenty of booths, large bar area, great patio (perfect for people watching) and sweet upstairs area for smaller groups. Our service last night was just about perfect - efficient, friendly, helpful and considerate. Case and point? Hubs and I dined with another couple, and my friend is about 7 months pregnant. When the server brought three of us our margaritas, etc. she also brought a mocktail for my buddy with baby. Sweet! 

Here's my take on the food...

Guacamole: 5\/5: Some of my favorite guacamole in Charlotte. It was super fresh, well made and gigantic. The four of us barely finished it. It may be more expensive than other places, but it is delicious and feeds many. 

Skinny Margarita: 4\/5: It is indeed a skinny margarita. I believe Vida touts this as fewer than 100 calories. It's a good margarita - especially for that caloric intake. 

Chicken Enchiladas: 4\/5: I thought I ordered the chicken & roasted corn enchiladas...but maybe they were just plain chicken. Regardless, they were flavorful, cheesy and filling. While some may say $14+ for enchiladas is pricey, this portion was mighty large and with the two sides I was plenty full. 

Fried Plantains: 4\/5: I love fried plantains. These are done right, albeit a teeny tiny bit greasy. 

Corn con Queso: 3\/5: It's a general ear of roasted corn with a bit of queso. Nothing to write home about, but it was fine overall. 

So, overall a really solid experience at Vida. I'll be back soon...as long as I come with a reservation!),(So this time I stayed away from the ""bigger than my head"" gaucamole and opted for the small one, which was equally as good.

Add in a few Corona's...some great people watching........and it was good visit.),(I love little hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints but there are times when I want more of a fine dining experience.  So with the help of the Yelp Mobile App I aimed myself at Vida.  

When it comes to Mexican my standards are very high.  That's because I live in the Philadelphia area and that's Jose Garces country.  If you are a foodie you know that he is a very well-known and successful chef and also holds an Iron Chef title.  He really knows how to do Mexican and Mexican-fusion!  I've visited his restaurants many times and he was on my mind when I walked into Vida.

If you enjoy modern décor and atmosphere you will like the look and feel here.  The place is huge and is on two floors in addition to outside patio seating.  I sat at the downstairs bar.  The day of this visit it was brutally hot outside and delightfully cool inside.

My bartender was Chelsea and she was beautiful and a great conversationalist when you could get her attention. Unfortunately that was a bit of a challenge and the bar was only half full.  So my service wasn't bad but just OK.

As many others have said the margaritas here are excellent!  They are made from scratch without using the typical bottled sour mix that lesser places use. 

There is something else here that is excellent and that is the guacamole.  It is OMG fresh and tasty and is paired with excellent tortilla chips.  The small size goes for $8.99 and is worth every penny.  If you stopped in for a guac and marg meal you would say five stars for sure.

I think every Mexican restaurant in the word has combination plates.  The one that I ordered had the incredibly imaginative name of COMBO 1 ($13.99). It included a chicken taco, carne asada taco, and a green chili pork and avacado enchilada.  It arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.  In a weird way I am both sad and pleased to say it was just fine.  Sad because I was hoping for more.  Pleased because there was nothing wrong with any component of my plate.  Everything was tasty but nothing was great. I've had similar combo plates in dozens of places.

My fellow Yelpers as a group give these folks three and one half stars.  In my view that is absolutely correct.  With my admittedly high standards I'm going to give them three.),(Stopped in here twice because it was in a good location.  They had good service and cold drinks, but the food was just ok.  I think this would be a great happy hour place for a few drinks and maybe a snack, but it is not the best mexican food out there.  Don't get me wrong, it is not bad, just nothing I would be dying to go back and try again.  If you go there it is probably because of the location and not the quality of the food.),(Chips, Salsa, CLUBBING.

Well, not really.  But almost.

We walked past two ladies taking some serious booty pictures by the door as we were walking in.  Yes, they were literally pulling their pants up high (way over the butt makes the best booty pictures?) and posing.  Mmmmhhhmmm.

Walking in the door I was hit in the face with the Manhattan club scene - Sean Paul was blasting and I could barely hear the hostess over the music and the people.  

I'm good with that - I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that play authentic Mexican-style music, but I say there's nothing wrong with a little dance dance music while you taco up the night.

We opted for guacamole to start, which wasn't quite table side - we got a bowl of pre-chopped avocado mix with another bowl of chopped cilantro, onions, and tomatoes that was mixed in by the guy that brought it over.  Table side or not, it was still pretty good.

The thing that stood out to me the most was the salsa - we pretty much drank the stuff.  It was super smooth, and had the perfect mix of cilantro and onions.  It was the closest thing to my favorite salsa ever, handcrafted by La Carreta in Nashua, NH.  So now I can say my two favorite salsas can be found in New Hampshire and North Carolina, two places which fail to share a boarder with Mexico and probably wouldn't pop into your mind if you were asked to ""name states that makes the best salsa.""  So far - NH, NC.  Boom.  There it is.

For food, we both opted for some type of taco, one with beef and one with chicken.  They came on a not quiet hard shell not quiet soft shell briefly fried taco deal, which was actually pretty good.  It was crunchy but still foldable.

We left full, happy, and after a day's worth of driving causing what might be referred to as mild dehydration (mixed with exhaustion)....a little tipsy (let's call it SUPER relaxed) after the second round of house margaritas, rocks, no salt.)"

If you're looking for giant plates of food covered in melted cheese where you end up taking half of it home, this isn't it. If you want two tacos to fill you up, this also isn't your place. 

So, what is it then? Tapas style menu, sharable plates, composed dishes. The portions are not huge. They are not meant to be. That being said, you're not going to pay prices like say a Sabor, Three Amigos, Paco's Tacos, etc. 

The man-friend and I went for dinner on a Sunday evening. We didn't make a reservation. Pro tip: make a reservation. But, we found two seats at the bar and really enjoyed the atmosphere there. I ordered the jalapeno margarita, Adam got the machete. If you read my reviews, you'll notice I love Mexican food and will order a spicy and\/or jalapeno drink wherever I go. I will honestly say, this is probably one of the best jalapeno margaritas I had in Charlotte. The sour mix is housemade. It was just damn good. His drink was the epitome of Instagram worthy. It was like a giant adult snow cone made with mezcal. I'm not the biggest mezcal fan, but I would order this. It was delicious. He had two of those. I switched it up and got a mango chile margarita and asked the bartender if she would make it extra spicy. Good, but the jalapeno margarita is still the star here for me.

I was starving, so I feel like we ate the entire menu. We started with the chewy chips and salsa. Those homemade dipping vessels are a must order. We also got four tacos- shrimp, fish, chorizo, and carne asada. The tacos are tasting size. That means it's like three of four bites. We split all four so we could try them all. The carne asada was my favorite. That being said, we then ordered the large entree type version of the carne asada (it was around $27), refried lentils, and the octopus. All were delicious. Just know this, the octopus has about three pieces. We also ordered the chia seed ice cream. So unique, I really liked it. Four drinks and all that food, our tab was around $115 before tip.

I'm a huge fan of the drink menu. This is a great place to grab drinks and some snacks. If you're super hungry, you'll end up spending some dough. I thought both bartenders working on Sunday were super friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. This is a place where I would prefer to sit at the bar than at a table. 

Other things to know: the parking situation in Plaza Midwood is just not great. Be patient when looking for a spot and make sure to pay attention to the signs. Also, if you remember what this place looked like when it was the Penguin, it'll take you a few moments to process and take it all in on your first visit.)"

The beer was quick - they have 20 or 30 fresh ones on tap - and while my burger was being put together, I had a chance to look around the place. It's a sports bar with a dozen televisions and there are a couple of skill games lurking about. The patio looked comfortable, but probably not on a July day when the temp is coming up on triple digits. I sat inside.

My burger arrived, cooked to order (medium rare) and assembled as requested. The burger patty is mixed with sundried tomato and onions and garlic and then they cop it with cranberry chutney, caramelized and brie. The burger was flavorful but wow, the cheese on top was an excellent choice. Sweet and smoked, it was perfect with the meat.

Very good burger, nice place. I could see returning.),(The fried pickles here are spears. SPEARS! And they are delicious. 

I feel like Kickstand is one of those underrated spots you sometimes forget about. I've found myself here now twice in the last two weeks and both times said to myself, why don't we come here more?

Burger-wise, I haven't had a bad one. I'm a big fan of the signature kickstand. The shroom n swiss is usually a go-to item. I always get the Greek orzo salad. The nachos are a great app to share. They are huge and smothered in a queso-like cheese. Onion tanglers app is also a large portion. My friend got a cup of the chili during our last visit. She really liked it, it has garbanzo beans in it. They also have a shells and cheese section where you can build your own and add toppings. 

They have a pretty good beer selection and a lot of local options. Different drink specials throughout the week, including $2 mimosas on Sundays. A lot of TVs. Nice spot to catch a game. 

Note: the bathrooms are shared with La Unica. You have to walk out of Kickstand to get them. They are located in a small hallway between the restaurants.),(Planned and hosted many an event here. Must say that this is our go-to spot in Plaza. You really can't go wrong with $1 PBR every night of the week. (Hipsters UNITE!)

The staff has always been so kind and willing to get to know us as regulars. Derek, Justin, Telley, Jenny, Sunny and Jessica are always smiling and busting to make sure everything is running shipshape. 

My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here and Bryson did an amazing job serving our group of close to 50 people. One server, one room. He conquered it. 

I've had my last two birthday parties here. Flawless as well. The private dining room is awesome. You can shut the doors and make it more intimate for your group. Great option. 

Been to many a catered event here as well. They have a great system down. 

The Food: You can't really find a burger on the menu that you won't like. (I recommend the cuban, running machine or the pocket press) Recently tried the sliders and they are rockin'. 

Wings are awesome. Head over on Wednesdays for $.50 wings. Great flavors. Especially crazy about Barbalo (Buffalo\/BBQ)

Definitely one of our staples in the QC. Can't believe I'm just now writing this review.),(Pleasantly surprised...I really wasn't a fan of the previous common house that was here so it took me awhile to take a chance on Kickstand. 
I am glad I gave it a chance I had one of the best turkey burgers in a long time. Yes the menu is full of grease and fried food but if that is what you are looking for you can't go wrong here. Tons of interesting burger combos and sweet potato tater tots with maple syrup I have to admit the tater tots sounded much better on the menu then they actually tasted. Overall service was good, decent drink specials -$4 Smirnoff flavored vodka drinks on Thurs. nights and food met my expectations.),(Where can you find a juicy and delicious burger, friendly staff and kitchsy atmosphere? Kickstand!

I was really intrigued about Kickstand so when a business contact suggested lunch here I jumped at the chance. What I walked into was a really relaxed vibe with bicycles all around - in their menu, on the premises, etc. I like it! Plus, they are working through some great events that will benefit local nonprofits through this bicycle feel, so that's just grand with me. So, I bet you're wondering about the food, aren't you? Well, here we go...

Beer selection: Nice selection overall...lots of seasonal brews, too! Specials looked pretty super, too. 

Fixed Gear Burger: Their juicy classic cheddar cheeseburger cooked to absolute perfection - I had a bit of pink in my burger which made me practically drool all over the table. Total noms. Plus, the cheese was super duper melty - total win. With these two qualities, plus a toasted bun I was a very, very happy camper.

Sweet potato tots: I love me a tot and these have potential. They are eponymous: sweet potato tater tots and served with a mapley buttery dipping sauce. I just wish that they were a bit saltier -  some kosher sea salt added to the mix would be delicious, as I'm a huge fan of the sweet\/salty combo. If Kickstand boosts the flavor\/richness\/saltiness and I'll have to restrain myself from turning into a tater tot. 

Parfait desserts: These were on the house as they asked my dining partner and me to give them a try. There were three kinds: chocolate brownie, strawberry cheesecake and key lime. As I'm such a sugar head as it is, these were pretty damn tasty. Creamy parfaits (no, not yogurt) topped with deliciousness of all sorts. My favorite was actually the key lime. These are listed for $3 each and they are a really generous and sweet (ha-pun) end to the meal. 

I truly enjoyed Kickstand and I'm very much looking forward to coming back.),(I met up with some friends in Charlotte last night and they took me to Kickstand.  If they hadn't told me this was a burger joint, I would have mistook it for a sports bar.  In fact, if I lived in Charlotte, I'd probably come here to watch sports.

The restaurant shares the same building (and restrooms) with an Americanized Mexican restaurant next door.  To enter either restaurant, you must enter a common area in between.  This area has a few TVs and arcade video game machines.  Kickstand itself has a ton of TVs.  Some of the booths have their own TVs.  There's a long bar and a separate room where I saw some Wii action going on.  There are also some outdoor patios.

Kickstand offers a wide variety of burgers, about 20 different kinds, that range anywhere in price from $7 to $14 per plate.  Each plate comes with a side.  Some of the more interesting sides that caught my attention include the sweet potato tater tots (""sweet tater tots"") and the gourmet corn on the cob.

I ordered the sweet tater tots because I've never had tater tots made out of sweet potatoes before.  The tater tots looked and tasted just how you'd imagine them.  If you've had sweet potato fries before, it's the same idea.  You get the same sweetness and consistency of the sweet potatoes in your tater tots.  The sweet tater tots are served with a brown sugar butter syrup which is very rich and thick.

One of my friends got the gourmet corn on the cob and it looked like it was fried or slightly charred with seasonings and sprinkled with a bit of Parmesan cheese.  Yum.

As for my burger, I went all out and got the ""Hung Over Cyclist.""  This burger has two grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun.  By default, the burger comes with just a tomato on top, but I asked for lettuce and onion too.  All this for just $7.50.

When it was served to me, it looked like a plate with two grilled cheese sandwiches, except the two grilled cheese sandwiches had stuff on top of them.  One had lettuce, tomato, and onion on top, while the other had a burger patty.  I added some ketchup to the patty, put the two suckers together, and chomped down.  Not bad!  The Hung Over Cyclist tasted exactly how it looked.  There was lots of extra bread and cheese because I was basically biting into two sandwiches at once.  It still tasted like a burger, though, because of the hamburger meat.  I finished everything, including my tots.

Towards the end of my meal, I realized the server did not ask me how I wanted my burger cooked.  I'm used to getting asked this in Atlanta, but my Charlotte friend informed me that North Carolina has gotten more strict about cooking meat, and most places will cook burgers well-done.

If I ever come back here, I think I'd order one of their traditional burgers.  While the Hung Over Cyclist was good, I ordered it more for the novelty of it.  One of my friends ordered the Kickstand Burger and it looked really good.

Our server was Adam and he was great.  Kickstand has ample parking in the back in a gravel lot.),(The CLT CM brought me here to ease my hunger, 10pm on a weeknight. It's a bike bar -- but not those kinds of bikes. Cruisers serve as decor. Good-looking beer list, with some locals featured -- though sadly, they were out of the brew I wanted. Ended up with the Olde Meck Copper... an interesting beer.

For food, I wolfed down the namesake Kickstand Burger. With caramelized onions, brie, and a cranberry sauce. Yum! Fries are unsalted, and have a crusty texture. But you can order tots instead, and the tots are tops!)"

For $12.95, this steaming, baked plate of deliciousness filled me up and left me some to take home. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were bright and tasty. Delicioso.

One of my favorite times of the year, Restaurant week.  My wife was in Pittsburgh and returning two days ago and her flight did not get in to 6:40 pm at Charlotte Douglas Airport.

Checked was available among restaurants that I wanted to try that I could make get them by an 8:00pm Reservation that was at the same time casual enough to serve someone in travel clothes and MezzaNotte jumped out. This one has been on my list for a couple of years now and for some reason or another, just never made it there.

Pulled into the Cell Phone Lot at 6:40 and my wife called at 7:00pm saying she was at baggage claim and would have her luggage shortly and would meet me outside. Left the lot and navigate the traffic at arriving till I saw her and we loaded the car and left.

Traffic was relatively light for Charlotte and we made it to MezzaNotte with 25 minutes to spare.

Parked the Car and walked in and explained to the owner that we had reservations for  8:00pm but could we go ahead and check in. With a smile, he said or course and escorted us to a nice table overlooking Providence Rd on one side and a rather attractive bar on the other.

The owner also introduced us to our server who proved to be excellent although English was not his primary language but he persevered and dinner came out perfect. The owner came by our table additional times during dinner and this hands on engagement was a sign of restaurant well run

We started with our beverage orders which for me was iced tea and for my wife, a Black Russian. 

Restaurant Week features a Pre Fixe menu with three courses.  For our first course or appetizer course, my wife ordered Melenzane which is Eggplant stuffed with Caciotta and Mortadella e Parmesan.  My wife indicated it had a long time since she had had Eggplant and this presentation was excellent.

As for myself, I had the Salmon Carpaccio which was fresh smoked Salmon with fresh dill garnished with arugula.  Excellent presentation and one of the best Carpaccio's I've had in a long time. Great flavor, texture and visually appealing.

For the main course, we both chose the Veal Saltibocca alla Romana which was Roman Style Veal with prosciutto and sage over roasted potatoes.  Great taste and presentation was excellent and portion size was huge.making it one of the best values I've found during Restaurant Week.Portion size was such that we both took some home and guess what we had for dinner last night.

After all of this, came deserts.  My wife ordered her favorite Tiramisu, a Italian favorite which I went with the Profiteroles which is Cream Puffs filled with Vanilla Cream and topped with Chocolate.  

Both offerings were excellent

Granted that Restaurant Week is just a snap shot of what a restaurant offers but this experience was enough to make both of us to want to go back.

Great service and food, good presentation, nice atmosphere and an accommodating management make this a great place for dining and I would recommend to anyone.),(I have driven by MezzaNotte many times, brick oven pizza just doesn't make me wanna stop, but someone said that MN was really good, so I filed it in my little restaurant Rolodex mind. Today driving aimlessly thinking where should I stop for lunch, decided to give it a whirl.

Sat at the bar, looked at the $8.95 express lunch  menu, get this. Choice of soup or two salads, slice of pepperoni or cheese pizza and then four or five main courses and TEA! nine bucks. Can I get a hell yeah?

Service was ok, my waiter, well, um, let's just say, ""he's just not that into me."" It was pretty funny, he was pleasant enough, but very indifferent.  Which, hey, I don't care, as long as I have everything I need I'm fine. 

I ordered the arugula salad, cheese pizza and chicken marsala. The salad and the cheese pizza were hitting the spot and I hadn't even had the chicken yet. The chicken marsala didn't have any mushrooms or a starch. It was chicken on a plate. It was good, not very marsalally, but good.

I enjoyed my lunch today and I thought it was a great value. One of the best  greetings is the olive oil white beans with crusty bread. That alone is worth the trip.

Can't wait to go back and see my BFF at the bar.)"

And it was a hit. 

First off, they're super friendly and more than happy to help customize what you're looking for. I got a simple box of 9 truffles, nicely wrapped in a bow. Perfect. As well, a small bag of chocolate bark for my lovely wife. Second, the prices were 

Great stuff that was much appreciated. Is it wrong to give chocolate to your dentist?),(Family-owned, operated, crafted. Just the kind of place I like to learn about. Though I'm not much of a chocoholic, I love the art of chocolate and checking out small shops like SC. The aroma alone that you're pummeled with upon entering is enough to make your sweet tooth swoon. 

After months of dillydallying and unfortunately only being in the area on Mondays (when they are closed) we finally got a chance to check out the assortment of chocolates and other products. Had a great time chatting with the owners and hearing a little about their story. 

We ended up grabbing 6 different truffles -- White Chocolate Pumpkin, Serrano Pepper and Chocolate, Cardamom, Milk Chocolate, and I can't remember the other 2. All were absolutely fantastic. True to their respective flavors without being overpowering, understated, or boring. The most interesting by and large was the cardamom. 

The kicker? Drinking chocolate. Think hot chocolate, but 10x as rich, and not with an overly present dairy flavor. It was so decadent and pleasing to sip on. It was in a tiny cup, but man a little bit goes a long way. I'd highly recommend to anyone, especially if you've never tried anything like it before. 

They also sell a bunch of other bar chocolates, cakes, and....cakes in jars. I'd never heard of anything like this before, but I'm so intrigued. Can't wait to check one out for the sheer fact that it's a freaking cake in a jar!

Thank, Secret Chocolatier, for being so amazing! Will be back very, very soon.),(Went back after I received a coupon from Andy (thanks Andy) and we were very satisfied with the various truffles and Bon bons.  The vanilla creme Bon bon was especially good as was the 68% dark chocolate truffle.  Compared to our first experience, this one left a great impression.  We will definitely go back!),(If I could consume an unlimited amount of calories, Secret Chocolatier would be on my speed dial. My first (and subsequent) run in with this local darling occurred at Atherton Market. I was minding my own business, gathering local produce and meats, nuts and dairy and then I see chocolate. Cue the music and internal dialogue...

Me: Oooooh - I can order chocolates. And try them. And buy sipping chocolate. Holy hell, what is sipping chocolate?! I want some. 

Andy (nice man from Secret Chocolatier who hasn't heard my internal dialogue above): ""Would you like to try some chocolate? Or how about some sipping chocolate?"" 

Me (aloud now): ""Yes. Yes please."" 

So I forked over a few bucks to buy myself a teeny cup of sipping chocolate. At first I was a little peeved that I pay $2+ for a tiny cup filled with seemingly hot chocolate. Oh no, friends. This is liquid love. Their sipping chocolate is smooth and rich, sweet but not too sweet. It's. Amazing. And honestly, a tiny cup is likely all anyone can handle. 

And how about their cakes?! I popped into Atherton for a Slow Food Dinner and not only did they have said sipping chocolate, they had some delicious looking and tasting dark chocolate cake with cream cheese icing. Y'all are lucky I didn't pick up the cake and start running. Delightful, moist cake with absolutely perfect cream cheese icing. 

Suffice it to say that I'll be back to Secret Chocolatier very soon. And if you can't see them at the myriad of farmers markets they frequent, check 'em out online.),(Excellent milk chocolate. It's so chocolaty that you feel like your mouth is transformed to liquid chocolate. 

The downsides are a lack of selection for white chocolate and ridiculously high prices: $2.25 for one little white chocolate ball. Those white chocolate balls are good, but since I'm a fan of Lindt white chocolate, I always compare other white chocolate to that. This was good, but not as good as Lindt white chocolate. 

If you want to know more about the milk chocolate, my son gave his milk chocolate mustache a 10 out of 10, which is extremely rare for anything.)"

Drove over from Davidson after Church and while we had to wait a few minutes,it was not a long wait.  We got out of Church and left Davidson around 10:40 and got to the restaurant around 11:20 so we had to wait 10 minutes since they do not open till 11:30.

It's a very nice restaurant with the main attraction being the views of the US National Whitewater Training Center and the other attractions such as Zip Lines, Bike Path, Cliff Climbing rocks etc.

We were promptly seated at a table at the edge looking down to the lower cataracts on the Competition Section. Fortunately we picked a good day and even though it was humid, temperature was in the mid 70's.

It's a good menu with an emphasis on Sandwiches, Pastas, Burgers, Wraps etc. Several items looked good and in the end, we both ended up with Ham and Cheese Panini's.  For a side, I ordered Potato Salad while my wife asked to substitute Wheat Berry for the Sour Dough which then did and for the side, grilled pineapple.

We both had tea as out beverage and even though I order half and half, it was still too sweet so I hate to think what the regular sweet tea would be.

Lunch came out shortly and service was excellent.  The Ham and Cheese Panini's was good but not outstanding. No latent heat from the Panini Press and the tomato had the taste of a Tomato in February.  Plenty on meat on the Sandwich though and the Potato Salad was good.

This was out first time though and when the Grand kids come up in the fall, we will probably take them here. My wife is already planning on getting a bunch of the ladies in the neighborhood together and coming over for lunch.),(Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks. The sandwich had great flavor but needed more of the elements, not enough caramelized onions or apples. Husband liked Cowboy burger but seasoned fries were way over the top on seasoning. Good service, great atmosphere, bleh quality. If the quality was stepped up to excellence they'd have something great going!),(Surprisingly good for pretty much the only food option on premise. Other surprise, it was relatively healthy options too! 

I kinda just guessed it would be all fried foods, maybe because it's the south, sorry I'm assuming. I got the Portobello Sandwich with peppers, onions,
balsamic on a wheat roll. See, they even upped the ante with a wheat bun! And it was good! The basil green beans were an excellent choice to round out my healthy meal!

I'm a dive bar girl and when I'm drinking I don't want anything fancy.  This place reminds me of the bar I worked at in college and I get a good vibe.  I have had great service the staff is very friendly, On my second visit the bartender already remembered my name...(and trust me I gave her no reason too the first time I visited lol)- but this place is true to what it is a neighborhood bar, serving it's regulars, tons of activities including darts, , karaoke, fooseball, as well as staples like cheap beer, and jello shots.  I know this will be my go to with the neighborhood folks from now on.  Haven't tried any food yet so I'll update once I know :)),(Steamers Sports Pub is the official EAGLES fan club in Charlotte, fact. Once you get in, you'll see some Philadelphia Eagles decor in the pub.
But world, I'm sorry I let you down. I went for the Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys game last week, when the Eagles defeated the Cowboys 37 to 9, and I must say they weren't prepared for such a big crowd.  

It was very busy, I mean very, VERY busy.
- The fan area was packed, and the waitresses weren't nice with an attitude. 
- The bar had only one bartender.
- I ordered grilled chicken teriyaki wrap. I got it after more than 75 min, and it was ok.

Steamers is a typical bro sports bar, with probably over 100 TV, and few drinks specials. But I don't I'll be returning. 

I should be giving them only 2 but the third one because they root for the Eagles in Charlotte.

But who cares? These are some really great ribs! I got a full rack even though I knew that there was no way I could finish them all. As with all good ribs, they were tender and very meaty and completely fall-off-the-bone. Not exactly moist, but not dry either.

For sides, I chose the mac & cheese which was excellent. I also got the red slaw, which is probably really good for red slaw but I didn't care for it. The hush puppies were quite good and not greasy at all.

Was it a five star rack of ribs? Maybe, maybe not. But I enjoyed 'em, my daughter enjoyed the two she ""stole"" from me. And my wife enjoyed the three ribs we brought home.

Oh, and they had some Triple C on draft. Bonus!

Charlotte has quite a few really good barbecue places. Sauceman's should be close to the top of the list.),(After getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while, we decided to take them to Sauceman's. I'm a huge BBQ fan and Sauceman's was one of the places left on my list in town. Though this location doesn't seem to be much from the outside, it definitely holds a firm place in my BBQ-loving soul amongst the other varietals in town. 

I had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of Uptown and always wanted to stop in. It's pretty small inside with some tables and a walk-up counter to order at. 

We started with some fried pickles and onion rings. Fried Pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous app in town. Throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town. They weren't really anything to write home about. I actually wasn't too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple. The onion rings were great. Thick, but battered cooked correctly so you don't end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing. Well done here, ladies and gents in the kitchen. 

I ordered the thick cut pork. Nice chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goings of the chopped variety. I really enjoyed the larger pieces and eating them with a fork and knife. The flavor was fantastic and their Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was a stupendous addition. The hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best I've had in town. Huge ones, too. Not small like others I've had, which was a nice change as well. I just freaking love hushpuppies all around. Very happy with my entree. 

Another big plus was the fact that they had Triple C's Smoked Amber on draught. Such an incredible brew and works rather well with BBQ. 

The service was great. One girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation. 

Next time, I might check out their wings as I've heard they are of note. 

Needless to say, I'm stoked about heading back to Sauceman's rather soon.),(Listen, I don't like to give mediocre reviews even when I had a far less than stellar experience at Sauceman's a while back. However, after hearing about some changes they've made, I met a buddy for lunch and gave them another go. I'm very happy to report that this BBQ focused joint in South End is now on my good list, instead of my shit list. 

To recap:

Interior: 3\/5: The interior is still a bit plain and awkwardly laid out but it looks as if they might be making some changes in that department too. Note - the bathrooms were absolutely spotless. 

My order - The Poncho Villa w\/turkey: 4\/5: Big hunks of tasty turkey layered with avocado, pepper jack cheese & lime mojo folded into Texas Toast. It was plenty of food and it was delicious. I also tried a few onion rings and I fully appreciate that they are hand breaded and had great flavor...my only ish with these - they could have been much crispier. 

The service: 5\/5: The man who took my order was awesome. Super friendly, helpful and honest with suggestions and made sure I had everything I needed. A far cry to the lackadaisical attitude I received last time. 

I noticed that this place was a bit busy during the lunch hour and folks were leaving looking happy and full...always a good sign. I'll definitely head back to Sauceman's to try some other sandwich creations or to score some of that savory barbecue.),(Sauceman's is serving up some seriously tasty smoked meat. 

The menu is pretty classic. Pick your meat, decide if you want a sammie or a platter, choose between red or white cole slaw, and then pick a side and a cold brew to wash everything down with.

I went with a pulled pork sandwich with white cole slaw and a side of potato salad. The sandwich was overflowing with some of the most delicious and juicy pork that I've tasted. The meat isn't served with any sauce, and instead you can choose from a variety of different sauces that sit on the table. I actually liked how the sauce and cole slaw came on the side. Usually when the sandwich is loaded with everything it's messy and tough to eat. So, it was nice to assemble the toppings myself. 

Prices are fair, and for 5 bucks you are getting an absolutely huge sandwich. Food is ordered at the counter, and everything came out within a matter of minutes. My trip to Charlotte was a short one, but I'm really glad that I was able to snag some authentic BBQ while I was there. If you are looking to do the same while visiting Charlotte, then make sure to hit up Sauceman's.),(Well i lucked out on this one. I was looking for BBQ and ran across the Sauceman. They close at 6 pm on weekdays and i got there at 5:40. The Pork ribs were outstanding. Juicy and tender with this magical rub that i just could not put BBQ sauce on. I had to try the Sugar Biscuits, boy was i happy i did. A tender biscuits smothered in sugar. I will be back. Staff was very friendly even with me coming in just before closing.)"

They are pretty much the worst Taco Bell I've been too & that's saying something. The employees are usually very rude. They had a nice guy working there for a little while but now I think they've just hired a bunch of annoyed teenagers led by an even more annoyed older woman. I sat in the drive-thru for 20 minutes for one chicken burrito. I was the first & only person in line, at the beginning, then there was a line of cars behind me after 10minutes of waiting. At that point, Annoyed Teen #1, opened the window (after taking me money in the first minute), and she said, ""what did you order?"" I was shocked...I told her the single item I ordered & she disappeared for another 5 minutes. At this point I said screw it & knocked on the window where the older annoyed woman appeared. I asked if I could just have my money back so they could focus on the other cars in line. 
After a few more minutes they gave me back my money with no apologies & I have not and will not go back to that Taco Bell ever again. And that sucks because I love Taco Bell and it's the closest one but I guess I'll just learn how to cook my own tacos.)"

Inside is where it counts and actually, the inside is quite the eclectic collection of furniture and decoration as well. A menu of burritos and tacos and such is mounted clearly and there's a soda fountain ready to go, plus a few bottled beers available.

I opted for the barbecue chicken burrito and when my name was called, a very large burrito double wrapped in foil was on a tray ready for me. Inside, a very tasty filling of chicken and sour cream and rice and beans and guacamole. The only improvement I can offer is that it would have been nice if it was a bit better mixed up. I ended up with the last five bites being all rice and burrito shell.

They do have a small parking lot and there is metered parking nearby.),(They have a salsa bar. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SALSA BAR!

I took my roomie to lunch here Friday because she was kind enough to help me setup for a festival. She's the best. 

I ordered my usual: one veggie taco, one fish taco, chips and queso. I love the mango on the fish tacos. Roomie said wanna share queso? The answer is always no. I need my own. File this under fat girl review.

The roomie went with a burrito. She thought it was a little bland, so she loaded it up with salsas and hot sauce. Problem solved.

What else do you need to know? Phat Burrito is small and can get packed during lunchtime. I try to go after the lunch rush. Workers are super nice. Beer available. Tofu options on the menu.),(I've been to Phat Burrito several times over the years and have always loved the location. It attracts all types of people in the Southend area. Hipsters, skaters, local biz owners, and Uptown bankers alike.

 There's something on the menu for everyone. Burritos, salad, quesadillas and all of the different toppings\/fillings you could imagine. Upon our last visit, I decided to try out a quesadilla after getting a burrito each previous visit. Can't say that I was blown away, but it was reliable. If you're hungry and craving meat and cheese between two tortillas, you can't go wrong. 

There was something really odd about the salsas that day, too. The medium variety seemed to have a very ""astringent"" sensation\/flavor that was very unpleasant. Typically, the salsa bar is the best party, but must have been an off day. No biggy, though. My wife tried the salad which was great. Huge torta next to a generous piling of lettuce, beans and all of the fixins'. It was a winner. 

A great little spot with great outdoor seating and mediocre seating inside. It can be a little crammed around lunchtime, so taking it to go or even eating out of your car may be in the cards. I think for the price (close to $19 for the both of us with only water to drink) in conjunction with the lack of splendor, it's not a top priority on my list to pilgrimage for lunch\/dinner, but always love to stop in when on business\/pleasure\/errands in Southend.),(Phatty Phatty Two by Four, this is what you chant after eating their humongous burritos!  Great little spot to sit outside, drink a beer and support local business!  Yay, everything I love.  What I like best is their chalkboard that reads:  Be nice or leave.  This should be everywhere.),(Since Phat Burrito isn't too far from campus I've been here a few times. I've tried the steak, chicken and fish burritos there. While I like the area that it's in on Camden and since I frequent BlackSheep a lot, I can't say that I love it. 

The location is really cool and it's not a bad hang out spot if you want to sit outside. It's actually preferable to sit outside, since it's either super crowded or just rather uncomfortable. 

The food wasn't bad. I'm not an especially picky person, but it's not something that I would be very openly recommend. I just wasn't blown away. It was also a bit pricey for what it was, in my opinion. For a little less you could get a comparable burrito at Chipotle or Moe's

I wouldn't rule out coming by again. My experiences weren't bad, but I do hope that it gets better.)"

Because of these return visits and some kinks worked out in the kitchen, Harvest Moon Grille has certainly earned another star.

In July I enjoyed a quiet and lovely breakfast to myself which included an iced tea and a delectable, uber fresh bowl of yogurt and berries. A first when the kind and efficient waiter set down the bowl, I thought it was a smidge shy on the portion. But oh no...I couldn't even finish it. The vanilla yogurt was perfectly creamy and accented beautifully with their house made granola. Which rocks. Big time. I left happy, full and healthy, indeed.

More recently, I trotted back over for another healthful meal when I ordered the farro salad. I don't think I've ever made farro at home, so I was anxious to try this groovy grain. Again, a small-ish looking bowl of whole farro and seasonal vegetables with lemon-garlic confit dressing arrived at the table. And true to form I finished it but I left happy, full and healthy. The farro wasn't overdressed, peppered or salted and the confit dressing was the perfect light touch. This is the one time in my life I think I would have liked a bit more dressing, actually. 

If you're traipsing around Uptown and looking for a great meal with a fantastic local focus (all items sourced with 100 miles of Charlotte), Harvest Moon Grill is a great choice. They have defined eating local.),(Sometimes hotel restaurants are at best mediocre. Harvest Moon Grille at the Dunhill is off to a great start.  Located in the historic Dunhill Hotel uptown. From what I can tell, it's a simple menu, focusing on local and seasonal produce and meats.  My eggs benedict, with a southern twist of toast and sausage were delicious, served with potato and sweet potato hashbrowns .  It's a little bit on the hotel expensive side, but easy to pay for when you know it's good products and made with care.  Can't wait to try dinner! Two pluses, were good service and decent coffee.),(After months of wanting to try this place the moment finally arrived.

Since I have eaten food from the Cart\/Truck I had expectations, but indoor dining is different here.

The space is small, but they do a good job with getting a lot of seating in the place.  The Decor is sparce and though interesting wall photos of local farms and some of the food you'll eat here, there just isn't enough of it.

With stone floors sound in this place is loud, but it was brunch and to be expected as folks were starting their days.

Living in the city was nice as it is only a short walk from my place and the fall weather was beautiful.

the GF and I looked over the menu but we had checked it out online before coming over.....the GF was disappointed when the item she saw online wasn't on the menu - so 1 star for that one.

She finally decided on the Frittata and I had the Full Moon breakfast.  From the time of order to receiving food was 20 minutes.....though they kept our coffee mugs full it seemed a bit long.

When the food did arrive my consisted of eggs over easy, but the yoke was still clear in many places.....a tad under done which I read had happened here many times before, but was hoping I wouldn't be another victim...unfortunately I was this time.

The Frittata for the GF was overdone and she didn't finish it.

Everything else was good, but for $24 for 2 I can think of a million other places for breakfast in the city.  Though the local - slow food movement may not be in place for many of the other places I'm thinking of, the food at them is more consistent, faster delivery, and cheaper prices making Harvest Moon a once in a ""blue moon"" place for me to eat.)"

It's an odd little location -- juxtaposed closely to the railroad tracks amongst the rather aggressive drivers of Central Ave, this place is introducing some things to the community that definitely of note and daring. 

Where I can't comment on the flavors, the litany of burgers and incorporation of heart-stoppingly wonderful toppings seems endless. Some of the options just look incredible at first look and would only become something of legend to someone with a hefty pair of beer goggles on. Example: The Central Burger - Burger with fried mac n' cheese. For real? Can't say I'd ever venture down that road unless severely inebriated, but goodness it sounds like a dream. They house all of the usual suspects for sides, too. Fries of all kinds, other fried things, and....fried things. They have a kids menu as well for those with little ones. 

I ordered a veggie burger and was thrilled with the flavor. The texture was great and not wimpy like so many others I've tried. Great, fresh veggies piled high and wonderful sauteed shrooms and onions. Also enjoyed the cucumber salad. Great sweet, perky, vinegar flavor. I'd definitely order it again. 

Big plus for the decor. Tons of old school posters, aluminum signs, and booths with what looks like burlap on the back rest. Never seen anything like it! 

Another huge plus for the beer lineup. Saw Big Boss, Natty Greenes, NoDa, and OMB. Good stuff. 

The staff was great. Server was lightning fast in taking our order, bringing extra napkins and drinks without our having to ask, and other items. Loved that the general manager stopped by a few times to check on us and see how our meal was. 

Prices are very reasonable, too. Three of us ate for less than $30. 

Where Joe Hoopers is a great place to grab a burger, fries, cold beer, etc, the healthy options are few and far between. I'd definitely come back, though perhaps to just enjoy a brew with some friends but, hey, if you're stepping into this joint, you're most likely grabbing a greaser of legendary proportion. Viva fried mac n' cheese as a burger topping!),(A good addition to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood, Joe Hoopers is owned by the same folks as Whiskey Warehouse, and All American Pub.  I didn't have a chance to step inside to take a look at the ambiance but I grabbed a nice table outside on their patio which was great.  Always stoked to see outdoor seating these days!  

I hadn't heard much about Joe Hoopers so it was a nice surprise to look over the menu and decide what to eat.  It seemed to me that this was the kind of place you go and order a burger and I'm glad I was right.  I ordered the burger with pimento cheese and bacon it was so good and of course what's a burger without a side of tots.  I must say the best part of my meal was my bloody mary.  If your a bloody mary lover like myself ask for their ""bloody mary menu"" yup an entire menu dedicated to one of my favorite drinks you will not be disappointed.   

Overall this was a great lunch choice, hang over joint, or any time place to grab a drink and some bar food.),(Looking for a late night bite to eat we stopped into this place around 11:30pm on a Friday. Pretty slow but still serving food and that's exactly what we were looking for. They had a decent beer selection with some good locals on tap.

We started with an order of deviled eggs topped with bacon. Deviled eggs aren't always my first choice in appetizer but add some bacon and I'm down with pretty much anything. They were eggcellent! The filling was almost a bit spicy with black pepper and then the crispy piece of bacon on top was a welcome addition.

Because I have health insurance, I opted for the Central Burger as my entree. Bacon with fried mac n' cheese on a burger... sounds heart-stoppingly delicious right? I expected the fried mac to be a crunchy cheesy layer smeared over the burger. Instead, it was a patty of mac n' cheese, then breaded, then fried, and was the same size, if not larger, than the burger patty itself. Add some lettuce and tomato and that bad boy is about 6 inches tall - becoming a task to eat.

I love the idea of this burger but, the execution fell a bit flat. I love burgers, I love mac n' cheese, and I love bacon - which leads one to believe that I would LOVE the central burger. Unfortunately, the whole thing became too dry between the bread and the fried patty of Mac. With no melted cheese, it was like putting pasta on a burger. I think it would do better with a creamy mac n' cheese to add some flavor and moisture.

Although I wasn't in love with my burger, I enjoyed Joe Hoopers and our app was excellent. I would give them another try for sure.)"

After living in Charlotte for 4+ years, away for a brief 2 years, and now back, I just had my first visit with this fantastic little cornucopia of farmer's delight. I rode from Dilworth over to Plaza one Friday morning and then made my way down Kings Dr to pick up some produce for a fresh and veggie-centric dinner. Thankfully, there were hardly any other shoppers at the market when I arrived around 7am -- thus, the early start and open of the market is a must. I've seen just how much abuzz this place can become and it's especially fun to avoid on the weekend. Thankful for the early Friday morning option. 

Tons of local farms and regional products available at the market. I picked up some SC potatoes, eggplant, NC apples, heirloom tomatoes, and a boatload of okra. All which would become a hefty vegetarian feast for supper. Everything ended up fantastic and hardly seasoned at all. The flavors of fresh produce is really THAT much different when you get it off of a truck from a farm and not some weird distribution center. Glad to see that nothing is getting injected with anti-mold agents or nitrogen for ripeness. Just flavors of the earth, friends. 

Already a huge fan of this market and I can't wait to go back while they are in season. Looking forward to many more produce-heavy bounties.)"

Popping in at 6PM, which should have been the peak of the dinner rush, there was only one other table with people eating. I should have taken that as a clue. But the buffet table looked okay (from a distance) and I opted to stick around.

Taking a plate, I selected a few sliced chicken and sliced beef items that were not too dry and overcooked.  Too many vegetables that had been picked over, but if I looked underneath, there was some okay stuff. The plate was half-full. For the second plate, I tried some others. Unsatisfying. About the only thing that helped was that there was hot mustard on the cold table.

Dessert saved them from one star. In the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie. Very strange to have something like this at a Chinese buffet, but with some soft serve ice cream, it was the best thing I had.

I recall delightful scallop dishes, great sandwiches and great, locally sourced eats all around. Most recently, hubs and I enjoyed a tasty Easter brunch at Mimosa - a solid spot for all things eggy, French toasty and, well, Mimosa-y. 

For $24 I indulged a large buffet full of goodness and the best part is the included small plates menu during brunch time. Not only is the buffet nicely stocked, but the small plate menu is impressive. You want the special benedict? Order it. It's included. How about a few slices of walnut crusted, banana French Toast? Got for it. And, the crowning glory to their Sunday brunch? $5 mimosas. Mmmm hmmm. 

Get ye to Sunday brunch at Mimosa and be sure to visit the line a few times, including the dessert section!),(****** 4.5 stars *****

One of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original ""great"" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.

I really like the ""upscale Southern"" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.

Whether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!),(It appears that bar service is perfect by some feedback I've recently seen, but I continue to struggle with it and it seems other reviewers are impacted the same way............a summary of other issues that continue to plague this bar...

""My last experience, drinks and apps at the bar, was yet again a mixture.  The first bartender we had was NOT attentive AT ALL""

""Friends that we traveled with did manage to have one overpriced average drink that took 15 minutes to make in a empty bar though. With snotty host\/staff like that I don't care if the food is good""

""After about 10 minutes and well after my dining companion had received their drink, the bartender came over and said that I needed to choose another drink because she could not find the vodka""

""The bartender forgot we were there for awhile and our drinks were empty and then appeared to be caught up in eating some pizza and talking to other employees and we had to walk over just to pay and get out of there.""

.....................hmmmmm......still continues to be issues at this establishment in addition to my experiences.  I think Harpers Management could address this problem and make the bar experience great for everyone.

Also, for the Yelpers that were upset about me giving an honest review here and felt that if I don't have anything positive to never review about it...........those folks well......I'm from the south mind you, so..........Bless Their Heart. :^)),(Solid lunch spot. Be sure to sit in the sunny front room- the hostess tried to put me in a booth near the back, but the front is where to be. Large windows overlooking Tryon and the Wells Fargo Plaza. 

I had the Carolina Coastal Catch for lunch last week (artisan andouille sausage, jambalaya, baby peppers, green beans, tomato butter) which was delicious. Perfect place for a lunch meeting or to catch up with a friend- or in my case, an impromptu lunch date. I'll be back soon.),(Dined here for a working lunch.  The restaurant is huge and the tables were spaced enough so we could have a good conversation.  Opted for the steak salad and was happy that it was more salad than steak!!  They had plenty of southern favorites on the menu and they looked delicious.  Couldn't afford the food coma or would have tried.  Also have outdoor seating and looks like a great place to grab drinks.  Would recommend for a nice bite to eat.),(Beautiful upscale Charlotte dining establishment. Extremely roomy with several seating options throughout its dining area. There is a full bar which also has tables on a first come first serve basis. I dined with a large group. We had a limited menu and I can speak for at least 10 of us by saying Mimosa Grill did not disappoint. The servers were on point! They worked together to make sure our food arrived promptly, empty plates were removed immediately, drinks filled instantaneously and constantly asked if there was anything else we desired...all done with a smile. Mimosa Grill is fine dining. The table top tea lights, linen napkins and gorgeous view really set a great tone for an evening out.

I have to spotlight Mimosa Grill as one of my spots in Charlotte especially till about June of this past year. I kid you not that I literally would go every Monday from February all the way through June pretty much because of this crazy delicious dish they had. My yelp elite homie has now reached the point of just asking if I am at my usual spot in which she is implying Mimosa Grill. This place is next to the Wells Fargo building and is tucked away near the corner Tryon and EMLK Blvd. The hostesses are always super nice along with the waitresses but the bartenders are rock solid. Especially the female bartender, I feel like she is my friend away from home and she is always so sweet in remembering my order for drinks\/food. 

The joint itself seems to always be busy and a popular spot for happy hours as well. I went here once with a fellow yelper and we grabbed a few plates including the tartare which was ok but the star of the show here is just so delicious. I ended up getting the wagyu flat iron steak and the side of Brussels sprouts which had bacon and an apple vinaigrette to it. I swear to god if I could eat this combo every day I would...but seriously... It is the most delicious and tender piece of meat that just bursts with flavors. The portion is just perfect and it is amazingly good. The Brussels sprouts are just fantastic and I asked to make my two sides that come with the steak to all be Brussels sprouts. That is how good this dish is. I don't even remember what else I ordered since it was just meh compared to these outstanding plates. Now unfortunately the bad news is that they got rid of the Brussels sprouts in june and while the steak is delicious I am just missing this side so bad that the experience is not the same.. and trust me ive asked if they can just make it haha. 

Even with this slight hiccup this continues to be a solid spot for service, coziness, and good food. I will continue to visit when I get a chance and hope to god that these Brussels sprouts will make a repeat appearance.),(Been here for dinner (A-ok) and Sunday brunch (woohoo!!!). One of the best brunch speads I've had. They have the usual eggs\/bacon\/sausage etc but they also have a bountiful selection of other delicacies....salmon, prime rib, roasted pork, shrimp and grits.   Can't beat the selection for $20 a person.)"

f12Zv1B9crmSW58iyTR_mA,"Barbeque, Smokehouse, American (Traditional), Food, Restaurants",Charlotte,1,35.07013,-80.8435308,Midwood Smokehouse,322,4.0,"(Midwood Smokehouse opened its second location on May 7, 2015 in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte. It's in the old Sticky Fingers Smokehouse space at Toringdon Circle (shopping center). I visited this restaurant a couple weeks after it opened with a group of friends, two of whom make up two-thirds of the Barbecue Bros (http:\/\/barbecuebros.co\/). We ordered a nice sampling of BBQ and enjoyed the experience. The food and service were good.

At 5:45pm on a Friday, the restaurant was already very busy. We were told by the hostess that our wait would be about 30 minutes. We were seated in about 20. There wasn't much space at the bar so we waited outside with others. By the time we left around 7:15pm, the number of folks waiting had grown quite large. There must've been at least a half-dozen groups\/families waiting.

The inside of the restaurant resembles an American restaurant chain such as Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. The clean, open space features both a bar and dining room with a mixture of booths and tables. Our group of six sat in one of the circular bench-style booths by the windows. The interior sports several large TVs (great for watching sports), vintage North Carolina artwork and memorabilia, and artistic metal cutouts with a BBQ, farm, and kitchen theme.

I haven't been to Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood, but I was told by my tablemates that that location is different in look and feel. This location in Ballantyne is designed for the suburbs. There's plenty of parking too.

The BBQ served here is influenced from various styles from the Carolinas to Texas. Aside from the standard sandwiches and plates, Midwood Smokehouse also serves salads, tacos, and appetizers like Pimento Cheese Fries, Fried Pickles, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos. Expect to spend about $8-10 each for most sandwiches (includes a side) and about $10-18 each for most plates. Plates come in both small and large sizes.

We went with the following:

BBQ:
* Burnt Ends (small, $13.50) - crispy caramelized cubes of brisket tossed in a housemade Fat Tire BBQ sauce
* Combo Platter (""Well-Fed,"" $22), which came with:
* Carolina Chopped Pork - hickory-smoked chopped pork lightly dressed in Eastern NC vinegar sauce
* Beef Brisket (both fatty and lean) - Texas-style sliced beef brisket served in natural juices
* Smoked Sausage - combination of beef, pork, and garlic
* Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry) - smoked

Apps & Sides:
* Hushpuppies (whole basket, $5) - scratch-made, slightly sweet and warm, served with BBQ sauce
* Collard Greens
* Classic Mac & Cheese
* BBQ Slaw

I liked everything. The food had simple presentation and was served in old-fashioned plates and bowls with floral decorations akin to something you'd expect to find at your grandma's house.

The Burnt Ends were rather tender and flavorful. They were more tender than I was expecting. A good bit of sauce, flavor (sweetness), and caramelization. These were probably my favorite of the BBQ meats. The Carolina Chopped Pork was on par with other chopped pork I've had around the state. Moist and tasty, the meat was smoked with hickory logs from North Carolina.

You have the option of ordering the Beef Brisket fatty, lean, or both. We got both and the brisket was delectable. Smoky with an appetizing chew and consistency. The Smoked Sausage was A-OK. Plump and glistening, it was charred on one side and had firm texture and bite. The Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs were excellent. Near ""fall off the bone,"" the somewhat fatty meat and rub were packed with delicious flavor. Note the ribs are available with sauce as well.

BBQ sauces at the table included South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature, and Habanero. My favorite was the subtly sweet Midwood Signature, but really, none of the BBQ needed any sauce. The meats tasted fine without it.

The Hushpuppies were small and soft, almost squishy. They weren't crispy nor crunchy, but had comparatively smooth centers. The Collards, with bits of pork, were alright as was the BBQ Slaw. When it comes to slaw, you can order both mayo-based ""Coleslaw"" or the NC traditional vinegar-based ""BBQ Slaw"" (a.k.a. red slaw), finely chopped. The Mac & Cheese was great. Made with elbow macaroni, it was nice and cheesy with small, chewy bits of hardened, charred cheese. It was moderately oily, but lots of good mac 'n cheese are greasy.

Service was terrific. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time and I was impressed with how our server remembered our food and drink orders after we'd changed our minds and switched them up on her. Kudos. Founder\/owner Frank Scibelli personally checked on our table. Midwood Smokehouse plans to open more locations including one in Columbia, SC.

The menu has interesting and humorous movie-themed items listed. ""Dial M for Mozzarella"" mozzarella sticks. ""Pretzels at Tiffany's"" pretzel sticks. ""Pickler on the roof"" fried pickles. ""The girl with the bacon tattoo"" potato skins. I think you get the idea. Prices seem to be about the same that you'd pay in a restaurant. The popcorn is bottomless.

More than 25 minutes of previews and coming attractions, during which they kept the lights on. I guess so people can see what they're eating? Once the lights went down, the quality of the movie and the sound was very good. Comfy seats with adjustable armrests. I enjoyed the movie.),(So, Cinebarre can be just a theatre, just a bar, just a restaurant, just a hangout spot in the evening (pool tables and live music on some nights), or all of these compiled into one spot for an outing. I'm not usually keen on theatres that show national releases, but Cinebarre makes for a unique experience that is accessible, can be affordable, and one that can be had on a whim, if need be. 

The staff is so friendly and they really work to make sure you come in and get what you're expectations beckon for. We walked in, intending to have brunch and a movie, and they asked us if we wanted to order our food before we went in to the theatre. Once seated, our server came to our seats within a minutes to take our order and make sure we had correct the menus. Where the brunch menu isn't anything spectacular, the fact that they take your order, serve you, and bring you the check all before the movie is over is just fantastic and pain-free.   

One of the other things I love about this joint is $5 Tuesdays. Much like some of our other AMC theatres in town that do $5 weeknights, you can check out a movie on a Tuesday for so cheap. Two for the price of one. Makes it a little easier to justify a few drinks before and during the film. 

Bathrooms are also spectacular. Dual entrances\/exits, excelerator hand dryers, clean as a whistle. Much appreciated on this front. 

So happy that a cool and easy place like this is south of Uptown. Looking forward to many films to come. Hopefully the hobbit in December! Cheers, Cinebarre!),(If anyone is a popcorn snob, Cinebarre has the best popcorn.  It is served in a large stainless bowl and it taste like its coated with salt and real butter.  I could not believe how good it was!

Cinebarre also offers bar food, brunch on Sunday, early movies, booze, $5 Tuesdays, they also show TV shows on certain nights and they were showing the Super Bowl when we were leaving..  

Seems like a nice neighborhood bar vibe even if you aren't seeing a movie.  A great place for private events too.  A great addition and let's face it, sometimes when you want to see a movie, you do go to one that serves booze, even if it is a trek.)"

Important NOTE:  Their curry chicken is UTTER Perfection!  I mean A-Ma-ZinG!
However their egg rolls are greasy and lack flavor (unless you like the taste of grease and bland cabbage).  Their sweetened iced tea is a bit overpriced for a regular sized drink which they will fill completely up with ice if you don't ask them not to, but it's tasty.
The fried rice is not good, It doesn't have any vegetables or anything else.  Its literally fried rice and that is it, but their lo mein is good.

With the exception of 3 years in Ohio and 6 years in PA, I've lived in Charlotte or the Charlotte Area since 1970. This place has been around since 1962 and has had great reviews for years for simple fare done right.

The history reminds me a bit of Premanti Bros in the Strip District in Pittsburgh. Both got their start as small restaurants serving worker in nearby warehouses and factory's and developed a very loyal following. When I lived in the Pgh area, the Strip District was enjoying the start of a revival and becoming a destination. When I moved back to  Charlotte, the area around Price's which is called South End was also enjoying the beginning or a revival and today with commuter rail, has become a destination in of itself with massing amounts of housing being built.

One reason I've never made it here before is because when I'm in Charlotte, I'm there for something else and I forget about it.

There was speculation in some of the local media that with all of the building in South End and the closing of a number of other restaurants and venues to make room for new building, was Price's Chicken Coop days number.

I don't know it that is the case but it stuck in my head and when I was in 1st Ward for a meeting at one of the Churches, I made a concerted effort and actually planned out my day to include Price's and I'm glad I did.

Streets area a bit congested with a lot of work being done on the rail line expanding the stations but I was able to find a pretty close parking spot on the street.

Walked in and it was like controlled bedlam. A lot of people waiting but four counters open so the wait was very short.

A brief overview for those who have not been.  It's counter order but you can order ahead but requires 30 minutes for your order. Cash only but ATM close. Take out only and no seating inside or outside either.

That said, I  ordered 1\/4 of a 3 1\/2 pound Chicken, all white meat Dinner that also included Hushpuppies, Roll, French Fries and Cole Slaw. Tea was extra but all in all a very good value.

Picked up my order in just a couple of minutes and drove back to Cornelius and ate my lunch overlooking Lake Norman.

The Chicken was excellent. Large meaty breast and a wing with a light breading cooked to perfection. The Hush Puppies were good but probably would have been better hot but I got caught in the I-77 Construction Purgatory that all of us in the Northern Part of the County have to deal with.  Roll was good as were the Fries.  The Cole Slaw was pretty good but that that with a grain of salt because I don't normally like Cole Slaw and for me to say it was pretty good is a compliment.

Was it worth the trip,  Definitely yes and I will be back.),(When writing a review about Price's, you have to talk about the fried chicken! so let me jump right in and say it's delicious. I was a bit skeptical about what the fuss was about, but I can definitely see why people like it so much. 

It's always packed in here. They only accept cash. There don't allow substitutions. And they charge for hot sauce.

But you know what? all of that stuff is fine. The chicken is awesome and the price is very very reasonable. I recall the hash browns also being really good too. The hush puppies, slaw and roll weren't bad.

The chicken was excellent. Definitely a must try when you're in Charlotte!
Do it! boom.),(Fried Chicken; in every city, there is a place that cooks it with the idea, that it should be a great value, and it should hold up, even when packed in a ""to-go"" container.   This is such a place, in fact, it's only a takeout place, so don't bother planning an evening there, unless you like sitting on the sidewalk or dangling out of your car. 

I mean, the friend chicken here is good.  The drumstick is juicy, meat is tender, and the same can be said about the thigh also.  The batter coats it just right; no heavy glops of batter, when you bite in, you feel the skin giving way, to the decedent meat underneath.  The flavor is always present, the idea that it's a hug from the inside out, you get.  Sure there is a lot of great Fried Chicken places around Charlotte, but this one is the simple, working man's delight.

If you get the dinners, you also get Cole Slaw, Tater Rounds, Hush Puppies, and a nice roll. It's a perfect portion, you aren't going to be asking for me, for at least an hour, but you aren't going to be in a coma either.  Their sweet tea is the Maxwell House stuff, which is basically the base for most sweet teas, what you might expect to have been served by family or in my case, southern born friends. Yes I said it, maybe your parents served Lipton, but this tastes just about right in my mine. 

If you can get there before the rush, you might see the front of house, without trouble, but with orders made in minutes, you are assured, even if you take a few extra moments, you are still going to be rewarded with yummy food, that will make you happy, and smiling. 

Go here, lots of street parking, just off the beaten path, they close at 6pm, so beware.),(Holy smokes this chicken was amazing. Cash only!

The only downside is that there is no seating inside, whatsoever.  Most people got the box of fried chicken and ate it inside their cars in the parking lot.  There's a little park next door but it was too cold to eat outside. 

ORDERING - get in line behind someone (I believe there are several lines) and then know what you want to order.  If you get a ""meal"" which is the default it comes with tater tots, cole slaw, hush puppies and then the chicken.  You can specify what type of chicken you want as well.  

FOOD - Since it was two of us, we got 1 meal and then I just got a side of dark meat (thigh and drumstick).  

The tater tots are interesting because they are shaped like coins, but are SO GOOD.  So crispy and tasty.  

Cole slaw wasn't bad, maybe a little creamy.

Hush puppies were also very tasty.  Had a fried onion taste almost.

Fried chicken - it was just the way I like it, crispy, crunchy, and crumbly.  Not like a thick piece of fried skin that seems like a coating.  The chicken was moist, hot and flavorful.  Definitely the best I've had.

Overall, worth coming to try - make sure you take a look at the hours and be prepared to eat in your car.  So crispy and delicious.),(I had the dinner combo of fried chicken wings, which came with cole slaw, tater rounds, hushpuppies, and a roll.  The chicken wings had a nice crispy skin and was great with a dash of hot sauce.  I loved how they served round tator tots on the side.  We found a space a few blocks away and ate outside as this is more of a take-out.  The chicken is fried in peanut oil, and it's a pretty solid chicken place to check out.

Cops are here all the time, so if that is an indication of the urban legend, then so be it.),(I was looking for a place to kill a few hours in Uptown, and Brixx fit the bill perfectly. They've got an awesome patio, delicious eats, and friendly service: what more could you need? 

I was the only person there for the majority of my stay, but they didn't seem to mind. The patio had plenty of space to spread out (I was toting luggage and a computer) and they checked up on me just the right amount of times. The garlic knots were decent, nothing mindblowing, and the salad I ordered was huge and flavorful. 

Brixx isn't doing anything super trendy or memorable, but what they do, they do well.),(Pizza and beer is one of the great food combinations of all time and that's why you stop in here.  My always amazing Yelp Mobile App zeroed me in on these folks.  Thanks Charlotte Yelpers!

So I walked in the door and scanned the modern décor.  I don't mind modern décor when it matches the food but to me, pizza and beer is a rustic kind of meal.  I know it's a personal preference but I would have liked a different atmosphere.

Next came the beer list and the one word I would use to describe it is decent.  There was something for everybody here but nothing really exotic to excite the true beer aficionado. You can expect almost thirty drafts.   I was mildly annoyed that their list does not include ABVs.  They should add this sooner rather than later as it's become standard at good craft beer joints.

Next I perused the pizza menu and choose the BRONX BOMBER for $10.95. It included spicy Italian sausage, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, tomato sauce and fresh oregano.  I ordered it because the carnivore in me was roaring and this is as close as I could get to a meat lovers pie.  They should consider adding one to the menu.  It was out quickly and I have to say I was impressed.  The amount of toppings was appropriate.  It was not greasy and that's a very good thing. For me, one thing that's true of a great pizza is that you can taste both the crust and the toppings.  That was true here and the delicious taste of a little char on the crust came through.  The size of the pie is worth noting.  It will definitely fill up one person but is probably a little small for two. Overall this was a very good pie.

Throughout my meal customer service was just fine.  These folks get a solid three stars from me and if I could I would go for three and a half.),(For a casual happy hour type place, Brixx is alright. I was here in a party of 12, and was able to sample a lot of the menu. And it was pretty decent... even for this Chicago pizza loving girl. 

Their zza is more flatbread style, which is great because you feel like you can eat a lot more. Bonus points for having a whole wheat crust option! I tried seven or eight varieties, and recommend their quattro formaggio and mushroom and arugula.  For those who like traditional margherita pizza, do not order the one here. You will be disappointed as it is basically a cheese pizza with tomato and basil. 

While Brixx is a pizza and beer place, they also have delicious appetizers. I swear I could eat a whole order of their gorgonzola blue potato chips by myself. Yes. Please. 

But the real winner here is their desserts. The pumpkin tiramisu and chocolate mousse cakes were fantastic.

Prices are super reasonable.)"

I enjoy grocery shopping at 10am. 

This location is my neighborhood Teeter. The parking lot can get absolutely slammed. I often find myself trying to find a spot on the back street behind the lot. So, pack some patience here. If you want to skip all of that hassle, order your groceries online and pick up in the ExpressLane.

I always tell everyone the same thing about grocery stores, you know what you buy every week. So, the right store for you may not be the right store for me. It's not all one size fits all. I scope the weekly ad (make sure you have a VIC card), that's how I usually meal plan when it comes to proteins. Everyone who works the meat and seafood counter is really friendly. 

They do have a pharmacy, Starbucks, and a nice prepared foods section (salad bar, pizza bar, Asian bar, etc). They also have a nice wine and beer selection. You can usually find someone there sampling as well. Shopping and samples of alcohol make everything better.),(4 stars for a Harris Teeter? Well, when you're as close as you can be to looking like a higher end grocery store, you earn it, I guess. I won't bother with the ""I remember when....."" stories about this location. Sure, it was a great location for PM residents before and (guess what) it still is. 

They've made some massive improvements, though. The parking situation is hilariously better than what it was. It was awful before. It isn't great now, but it's light years better than what it was. 

Also, it's clean. Really clean. Coolers, aisles run in both directions, tons of space in the back for the deli\/seafood counter(s), and even outdoor\/upstairs dining\/lounge areas. The aesthetic alone from the exterior makes it stand out. They kind of went with the ""old timey"" appeal with some of the signage\/decor. I dig it. It gives Plaza a nicer, more neighborhood-y feel, in my opinion. 

End of the day, it's still just a Harris Teeter. However, it's definitely one of the more unique locations in Crown Town.),(One of the cleanest grocery stores I've been to in a long time! I was amazed at how everything shines, the floor was sparkling. All of the glass cases had been recently squeegied, devoid of fingerprints. 
The store was not too overpriced. I saw some beers priced cheaper than I'd seen them at local smaller markets. The food seemed a bit on the high end, and their selection was a bit on the smaller side. 
The staff was friendly and got us checked out while joking with us the entire time. I was a bit taken aback that they want you to have a shopper ID card, so they can track the number of cans of tuna you buy. I guess you get a discount if you have one. 
The worst thing about this place is the parking. We circled and circled, looking for a spot, finally finding the furthest spot possible. The store is located on a hard corner, so it's a bit difficult to find a space. 
The best thing was the fact that you can just come in here and grab a coffee and a meal to go. They have a great salad bar, and lots of premade options.),(I was only in town for a few days but since we were renting a house through AirBnB we needed some basics to keep us going.

I can't really vouch for the food (it looks both expensive and good), but the bar is well stocked and the bartenders are fast, friendly and efficient.

Good times to be had here!),(A-OK is a good description for Icehouse.

Patio: probably the best feature about this place. Complete with a bar and TVs... it's a great spot to grab a beer on a nice evening.

I love the space. Lots of TVs and a fun atmosphere to watch a game. Is it one of my go-to spots for sports? No. Do I like coming here? Absolutely. With so many options in Charlotte, it ranks in a mid level spot on my list.),(I wasn't really sure what to expect from the Icehouse but I actually had a great time.
1\/2 price drafts on Wed. nights with a pretty good selection to choose from. They also had live music and I was excited that they had some healthier food items on their menu unlike a lot of other sports bars. I opted for the seared tuna appetizer and it was very tasty. There is also plenty of space to hang out indoors or outdoors. I will definitely be back soon.),(Oh noes, Icehouse. I was really excited to bring some out of towners to this new restaurant\/pub seated in the heart of South End. The building itself is really neat - super tall ceilings, a nice patio facing South Blvd. and tons of super sweet flat screens inside. This would be a great place to watch a game...but not to eat...and here's why. 

Four of us were seated and ordered all different things off the menu - chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp and spinach quesadillas and I ordered the Thai beef salad. Even as we ordered, we thought that some of the menu items looked a little pricey as depicted. But, as this is a new restaurant we didn't quite know what to expect. The food came out very quickly - quite literally within 5-10 minutes, which was good. But the outcome was not. My mother ordered the shrimp and spinach quesadillas and upon tasting them, she put them down and asked me to try them. The spinach had a metallic, almost chemical taste to it. Within five minutes the waitress came over and she offered to bring her something else, later stating that too much oregano was reason that the quesadillas tasted strange. No offense, but I cook with oregano often, and that wasn't the odd taste. 

My husband's shrimp tacos were fine, but we took issue with the fact that for $12 - all he received were two small tacos with no sides. And my father's chicken tacos - $9 for the same. Even if these tacos were stellar (which per my dining mates they were just ok), that is a paltry amount of food for the price. The only decent item at the table was my Thai Beef Salad - the seasoning was nice, the mint was a pleasant touch, I just wish it had a little more spice. Portion wise it was more than enough. 

As a replacement to the spinach quesadillas, my mother ordered the Thai beef spring rolls and they were positively swimming in oil. Now, I don't mind a fried item, but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isn't appetizing to anyone. Needless to say, she didn't eat very much at lunch. On a brighter note, Icehouse has an extensive and affordable beer selection that would please just about anyone. 

Overall, I like the concept and the feel of Icehouse - plenty of brews and plenty of tvs. The food, however, fell waaaay short. I really hope that this place reevaluates its menu as the location and the concept have a lot of potential.),(I went into Icehouse after waiting tables tonight, grabbed a beer, half night pint night on Wacky Wednesdays.

 I have on the other hand been here a number of times for happy hour or for a late night drinks and apps with friends, or on the weekends to watch college football or pro football. I like the set up here. lots of tvs, modern bar, high tables. 

The beer selection is solid here. Not as many as Taco Mac, but definitely still good. And to be honest, my first few visits here I kind of stuck to basic appetizers, but later I tried sandwiches and tacos and really enjoyed them. I was pleasantly surprised by the food.

For dinner, we had the pita and pesto hummus which was very good. Their fresh sourdough bread is amazing too! I chose their tomato basil soup, which I've had before, and it was good, but it's never piping hot. Their salads looked amazing too!

The grits were made into crab cake portions, with shrimp and andouille sausage. It wasn't the shrimp and grits I was imagining, I wanted the grits to be more of a porridge, so was let down. But luckily I was too full, I could only eat a quarter of my dish anyways.

Great service, and we had 2 birthdays to celebrate, and the desserts they brought out were so nice! Would highly recommend them for their breakfast, although I wish they had hash browns as a potato option!

Does not have a Japanese Garden but does have a beautiful view of a Lake and artificial waterfalls.

My wife ordered a Steak Salad.  Actually there are serveral salads available and you can get steak or chicken or other items added.  She also ordered a side of seasonal fruits which for a change, was something more that just mellon.

I had a shrimp Po Boy that except for being a bit overcooked was excellent. My side was a simple salad which was anything except simple with a pretora of mixed greens, tomotoes, pickles etc. It was so hugh I could not eat all of it.

Service was outstanding from start to finish and I have to give high marks to the entire staff.

Outstanding Lunch and by the way, they did honor the coupon we had even though it's no longer Lakefront.

We're both sushi fanatics, loving (and eating) everything from yellowtail sashimi to creative maki rolls. 

NZ Cafe really is tucked away from the street - hidden in a strip mall off of Sardis Rd. The inside is interesting and super small. When we stopped by here we counted roughly 40 possible seats in the place - and that would be a tight fit! Regardless, we were able to grab a four-top and sit comfortably while we perused their menu(s). 

And what a menu it was! We were each given four different menus: one solely for sushi, one dinner menu, a specials menu and one other blue menu that I didn't even get a chance to look at. I was a bit overwhelmed! The service was attentive and friendly and our waitress was please to offer up a few suggestions from their specialty roll menu. Here is what we went with:

Steamed Potstickers (Pork): Six tasty postickers served with a nice, light soy sauce. These potstickers were nicely flavored, especially with the sauce. 

*I'm not a roe fan, so we chose to abstain from all fish roe from every roll. 

Dynamite Roll: Spicy yellowtail, crab and avocado. While I wasn't super impressed for this roll (a bit mushy and lacking flavor), it was $4.95. That's a steal in anyone's book.

Tuna Crunchy Roll: I really wanted to love this roll, but it was just way too fried for my taste. The outside was super crunchy, stiff and too heavy. Plus, the roll came out piping hot and I'm not a fan of hot tuna rolls. 

Pink Roll: Tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, cod wrapped in soy paper. This was a pretty good roll but HUGE! So large that I had to gnaw off half at a time. I'm sure that looked super hot. 

Ichiban Roll: Spicy albacore tuna, crab, avocado, topped with
spicy tuna and wasabi mayo with a dash of Sriracha on top. I liked the flavor of this roll quite a bit, as it's definitely got a kick. I wish it had a little more texture, though. Maybe some crunchies on top would help? 

While I definitely see the appeal of New Zealand Cafe, the cheap rolls, generous portions and creative combinations, it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. Considering it's a bit of a hike from my house, I'm not sure I'll be coming back often, but I definitely want to give this little gem another try in the near future.),(Years ago I was in this shopping center and I looked at New Zealand Cafe Sushi and I thought to myself that place looks like it would be sketchy.  It looked like it was a large space and would have a lot of televisions.  

Fast forward a couple of years, some good Yelp reviews and an invitation from friends, well maybe I should give it a chance.

The place is tiny, it has about 9 tables and 4 seats at the sushi bar with a bunch of televisions. Televisions are in the darndest places. The food is delicious.  There is more to offer than sushi, but I have only been twice and sushi is the only thing that I order.  I might go as far as saying it is my favorite sushi restaurant.  Every roll has been delicious, well, except for one. 

Tonight we ordered a California roll with tuna and the tuna was mushy on top, my husband said it was like cat food.  That was a bit disappointing, but not enough to make me deduct a star and certainly not enough to keep me from returning. 
My favorite roll tonight had diced jalapenos and it was burn the baby hot. It made me cry tears of happiness. Booooohoooooo.),(By far, the best sushi in Chsrlotte. In terms of variety, quality and price it TOWERS head and shoulders above the rest. Fyi, usually a wait at dinner time. Their quality holds up for to go orders as well.  2 people can eat very well here for around $40, which is a steal compared to some places and their $20 rolls.)"

Anywhere I can find it on draught, it's a winner every time and definitely stakes it's claim as a high gravity. Absolutely fantastic beer. 

Made it to the brewery\/taproom this weekend for the first time. These guys operate a little different than some of the other breweries in Charlotte. They open up the taproom for special occasions (new releases and events) and when they do, it's always fun to see people lined up around the row of taps. The warehouse-y setup is nestled off of Tryon a ways in the Steele Creek area. Not hard to find. Just follow your GPS\/iPhone. 

Jon, leader of the bunch, is a great guy. Cranks out great beers that are amazing and pretty easy to find at some of the more crafty watering holes in the QC. Queen City Red, Blonde, I-77, seasonal 24K, Punkn' Brewster and Race Day have all been great. Race Day, released this weekend, is a much lighter and drinkable IPA. Unlike the HG I-77, this goes down easily with a meal or alongside a long conversation in the evening. AKA, you can drink multiple and still hope to drive home, haha. 

The taproom is small and humble. A true brewers taproom. Should you make it in to try some beers, they do take cards with a mobile reader. They offer some bottled beers and will fill growlers of anything they have on draught. 

Definitely one of my favorites! Love Four Friends and so happy to have them in Charlotte.)"

This week, we chose the Ballantyne location of Bad Daddy's. Not that there's anything wrong with the Dilworth location except for the parking situation.

We were seated inside after we arrived just after opening. A nice sunny day with a good breeze, it was perfect. Great service from a friendly waitress who kept my friend's water glass filled. I had a beer - Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale. It was excellent.

I took the waitress' recommendation for my burger and got the Pittsburger. It was awesome. Fully dressed with American cheese and topped with shoestring fries, it was a mouthful of cardiac arrest deliciousness. I ate the whole thing. And the excellent onion rings on the side.

Not terribly expensive - maybe a bit much for lunch - but a very tasty and very filling meal. I wouldn't recommend it on a work day as I had to head home for a nap. Mmmm...),(Love me some Bad Daddy's! 

The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either Charlotte location. 

The burgers\/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!

The wings fit well on the ""expected"" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef. 

The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.

The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar\/dairy laden enjoyment.

Great Charlotte staple.

Even the fruit tasted plain, like different colored chunks of water.  Even our pattys were without flavor.  Just all around bad experience.  The chips and pimento were ok.  The pimento was a bit too garlicky Well, hope the next time is better.),(I have major love for the Bad Daddy's East Blvd. location, so, naturally, I figured I would enjoy the Ballantyne digs! And I was right. Allow me to break it down for you...

Location: Right off of Johnston Rd\/521. You'll find plenty of parking spots! 

Layout: Wider and much flatter than the East Blvd. location. It was still quite busy during a Sunday afternoon lunch but not nearly as packed in as their other location. The patio (covered in the cooler months) is a nice addition, too! The bar also looks quite spacious. 

Menu: The same delicious burgers and sandwich concoctions you're used to. My favorite is the Frenchie...amazing grilled Granny smith apples, turkey burger and smothered with Brie and a touch of special mayo. Get it with a design your own salad...chipotle ranch dressing FTW. Their milkshake and beer lists are pretty extensive, too! 

Service: Attentive, helpful and fairly quick even when they're busy! 

If you get a chance, always ask about their burger of the day...it's usually a winner. It's good to be bad...daddy's.)"

I was offered two types of self-serve coffee once I ordered and paid, both a mild and darker blend. I mixed the two which is pretty standard for me.

I follow these guys on Twitter and was always hoping they'd camp out in the Southpark area one day to draw a lunch crowd. To no avail, I was forced to wait until this weekend! Happy to find these guys at Small Bar in the NC Music Factory for PBR Fest. Churning out pizza and wings for the beer crowd. 

I had heard multiple cheers of praise and glory about this truck's pizza and wings. I was even a little intimidated approaching the order window. The staff were all very friendly and helpful with describing all of the menu items. We ended up getting two slices of cheese, a slice of the buffalo chicken and 5 Carolina Buffalo wings. We sat down with 24oz tallboys in hand and went to town. 

I was happy to say that the wings are AWESOME. Perfectly cooked, a little crispy on the outside, not dry, tender, slathered generously with amazing sauce. The Carolina Buffalo is a winner. Mustard-based bbq with a plethora of buffalo sauce thrown in. My taste buds were happy. Uhh...they need to make a Carolina Buffalo pizza. (No brainer, yeah?)

The only thing that sank my happy sailing dinner experience was the pizza. A little lackluster and the sauce was a bit reminiscent of box pizza from the frozen section in the grocery store. Maybe our slices had been sitting out for a bit, but didn't have the freshest of textures. I did appreciate the crust and enjoyed sopping up the remainder of the wing sauce with them. I can't say that the pizza was banging on all cylinders or a culinary breakthrough, but is definitely reliable. The combo of wings and pizza in one meal from the street, though? Baller status. Grab a tallboy and it's all over. Foodtruck heaven. 

So happy to have finally tried these guys out and can't wait to see them at Chowdown Uptown in the near future! Carolina Buffalo Pizza, guys! Let's see it happen!

The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.

One of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.

My favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area.

Cast Iron Waffles is churning these things out like they're going out of style and each one is a hit. 

My wife stumbled upon this place and fell in love immediately. Resting at the base of a town home in a strip of other small business (Connected to the same shopping center as Wings and Rings and Blink off of Ardrey Kell) it's a perfect little bistro-esque location for breakfast. It may be a bit difficult to find for first-timers and actually find a parking space (you can always park in the bank's parking lot) but the location is very quaint and houses tons of personality. 

For those of you who appreciate waffles, you may have to dash the idea you have in your head. These are Belgian Liege style waffles. They aren't pouring batter into a piping hot waffle iron and handing out faux eggo garbage. This is a brioche type dough that is hand-pressed into a waffle iron. Filled with tons of pearl sized crystals of sugar, each bite of waffle is crunchy at first, bursting with sugar crystals and finishes with a brilliant chew. Be prepared for intrigue as many waffle aficionados tend to be. You won't think ""waffle"" immediately, but rather ""sweet bread."" The owners have put a lot of thought into how these are prepared and their dough is no joke. 

There are different choices of toppings ranging from whipped cream, fruit, nutella, maple butter and powdered sugar. There are the occasional seasonal options on the menu but I have yet to be impressed by any. My recommendation is go au naturale. Just plain waffle to see what your taste buds will be up against. If you're looking for an added sweetness, go for the maple butter. Not too overt with maple flavor and just the right amount sogginess to add to those chewy waffles. Many of you may consider this spot as more of a ""treat,"" than a breakfast joint. It all depends on who well you can handle the sweetness of the dough. 

These guys also do coffee and espresso drinks. None of which are a draw and pale in comparison to the lead singing waffles. 

One of the coolest aspects of the shop is the old school coke machine they have in the back. You have to get quarters from the register and then open the door to the fridge-style vending machine. Note: You have to pull your bottle of coke out REALLY fast for it not to lock down on your bottle. Ask one of the employees behind the counter. They'll be able to tell you more. 

Cast Iron Waffles is a must for anyone in the Blakeney area. The business owners are great to chat with and love to hear their customers' stories. Ask to hear theirs. What a great family. Love how they are operating this little joint. 

Hear, hear for Belgian Liege waffles in south Charlotte!),(Liege waffles - thank God for Belgium!  These sinful waffles are so good and if you pour the warm maple butter over It?  Hold on, I had to regain my composure, but you add that maple butter, omg!!  
We had the naked and the slowberry waffles (5\/5) and, the crispness of the waffle caused by the pearls of sugar embedded in the dough, I got one word for ya: DAMMNN!! 
Not a big operation but the service is good and folks were friendly (5\/5).
The restaurant itself is small but comfortable and the ambiance is nice (5\/5).

We came in on a Saturday afternoon and pretty much every table in the main dining area was full. We sat immediately, however, and worked our way up and down the menu. The service was friendly and very helpful with some of the items I was unfamiliar with. We placed our order and had a chance to just hang out whilst waiting. It did take a while to get our food, but chef was the only person in the kitchen and seriously putting in some hustle. Fun to watch! 

Our food came. DELICIOUS. I ordered the Buffalo Bean Bowl -- rice, kidney beans, kale, vegan ranch, and tofu coated in buffalo sauce. It was magic. So flavorful and all of the spices swirled around magnificently. We also ordered a side of the northern white beans, more kale, and braised cabbage. All were perfect. It's so nice when fresh veggies are flavorful in their own right and not slathered with butter or some bogus sauce. Chef really puts time into making each item flavorful. My wife ordered the seitan burger sans bun. It was wonderfully smoky and hearty. 

Each of our plates came with a banana nut muffin. Holy cow! Those things are amazing! No dairy whatsoever. 

We were stuffed. So much food and both of us dined for less than $30. 

Where I love the food and the staff, I think the ambiance is a little droll. Think their still working on the space and trying to liven it up a bit. Some simple decor would be great. Also, the men's room is a little dingy. Not a huge deal, but think it just lends itself to being a dated building off of Independence.

There's just something about a stir fry where you pick your own fixings and spices and they grill it right then and there.

Everything here is very fresh and a good selection of proteins and veggies and stuff to mix in. Plus a dozen powdered spices and another dozen sauces.

There's no complaining - everything in the bowl was selected by you. So if you're wondering where that chicken or crabmeat came from, look in the mirror!

Service is quick, even when it's busy. Drop off your dish, get a number and the server brings it to your table. Easy, pleasy, lemon squeezy.

So, it wasn't too much of a surprise that I was jacked when I read that we now have a Genghis Grill in Charlotte! 

The Good: 
As others have said, you really make your own meal here. As in - if you don't love the components, well, it's your fault. There are a ton of topping options - proteins, starches, veggies, sauces, spices, etc. The instruction from the staff is definitely on point and helpful as you navigate the bowl bar. Overall, I liked my bowl and was able to make it super spicy with plenty of dragon sauce, jalapeno and red pepper. My mouth was on fuego. Plus, prices are pretty affordable at $8.99 for a lunch bowl and $9.99 for a dinner bowl. The kiddos will love this place. 

The Meh: 
It's a chainy chain, so I didn't really find much character in the restaurant. While the service was great, I really didn't have a desire to stay any longer than I needed to. Plus, the quality of the proteins was definitely lacking for me...the shrimp are incredibly tiny and quite a bit of my steak was a bit grisly.

Boo bad service :(),(I absolutely beg to differ with the 2 star reviews of this place.

If you ever catch a red eye flight from the West Coast, (like I did from SFO en route to the Bahamas) and you didn't sleep a wink because this very CONSIDERATE lady behind you wanted to tell the guy on 14A about her life in the city, then yeah, of course you'd be craving nothing but carbs for breakfast.  Something sweet and fluffy like pancakes or maybe even French toast.

Although Charlotte's Airport has 5 wings, (named A-E) only 2 spots serve meals that will put the Atkins diet to shame:  Chili's and The Bacardi themed bar, both of whom serve pancakes for breaksfast.

Well, a certain Vanilla French Toast was calling my name and the one served up at Fox Sports Bar and Grill is substantial -- for $7.99, you get 2 thick slices of french toast, served with packaged Promise butter and Knotts maple syrup and sausage (or ham or bacon if you like).  You can add a  fresh fruit bowl for 99 cents and that whole meal will keep you full for another couple of hours.  

Our server Tami Jo was the sweetest.  She also had the cutest Southern accent!  She was quick to inform me that the wait for the french toast is about 13 mins, but I didn't care, after walking all 5 wings of the airport, 13 mins. was nothing.

The curried chicken had so many fresh, crisp vegetables and perfectly seasoned chicken in it.  And the Boba Tea was outstanding.  The best boba I have ever had.  The only thing that was not so great with this food, was the chicken egg roll.  The egg roll tasted like it had hard bits in it.  

Although the establishment only had a 90 score on their sanitation, the place looked spotless to me!  

They play this music that made dining in seem nightmarish.  It sounds like a bunch of cats in a bag meowing and clawing to get out.  You can hear it in the background of the video I took.  Listen for yourself.  

The prices were great!  A curry chicken meal was only $6.50 and the chicken egg roll was $1.50.  The next time I am in this area, I will be stopping in again.)"

Love love love the outside seating area. Very neat spot to sit and suck down some of their tasty brews.

Yes, the beer is good. I liked their Southwise Weiss and the Captain James Jack Pilsner which hit my palate quite nicely.

Oh, and speaking of palate, try the food menu. We had currywurste, cabbage and hummus. And a pretzel. Jeez, too much food! All decent stuff!

Yep, I like this place.),(There is plenty of space at Old Mecklenburg Brewery.  A coworker and I stopped in for a beer.  I opted for the ""Copper"".  I liked it so much that I ordered it a few more times the rest of the week when I was traveling in Charlotte for business.  Delicious!)"

Beer list is on the chalkboard with details on the brews of the day, what you can expect including how much ABV. All very Belgian and definitely all very good.

I opted for their White Ale and as advertised, it had hints of coriander and orange. Quite nice stuff, served in a SCBC logoed glass. Their flights are also very pretty with the right shaped glasses, though smaller of course, in a neat wooden frame.

It gets a bit loud inside, especially on days like today with a band. And the TV's are tuned into the latest sports.

A queue was waiting at the hostess stand, but there were seats open at the bar, so I headed there. Same food, same drinks. Why not?

I just had a soda water (which he apologized after accidentally refilling with plain water) and a bowl of their excellent she crap soup. The soup was great and for airport food, reasonable at $9. A soda water (basically, Coke without the syrup), a bit expensive at $2.50.

Seafood tends to be expensive no matter where you are, and Phillips at CLT is no exception. But the service was good and it was nice to be in a proper sit down restaurant at an airport.),(Though the place was a buzz - I managed to find a nice table for two along the garage door windows and picked up on the Charlotte Airport FREE internet allowing me to get caught up on my ""Check Ins"".
 
Service was extremely fast and my drink and food were at my table before I could even log on to my lap top - even though it was busy

The place seemed clean and my waiter was fast, friendly and came through on all my special requests. The blackend Ahi Tuna was cooked perfectly, the waffle fries might have been a touch on the cold side, the cole slaw was a bit larger in size then I prefer, but the taste was great. The four little hushpuppies rounded out the meal bringing the meal to a solid 3 stars.

Putting it altogether - the speed of the food and the service brings this place to a 4 star!),(Phillips Seafood is just one of a few handfuls of regional restaurants located in Charlotte airport that make this airport such a pleasure to fly through, as the food options here are such a welcome departure from the standard McDonalds and Sbarro (indeed, with the varied food options, free wifi, restroom attendants, live piano music and comfy rocking chairs, CLT is the only airport to which I've given a solid 5 stars).

I stopped at this restaurant to grab a quick bite during a 1 1\/2 hour layover.  I had a seat at the bar and was quickly attended to by Angela. She asked what I wanted, I requested a menu and she grabbed one from the next customer over and handed it to me. Lol.

I ordered a 9 oz pour of Chardonnay and an order of miniature crab cakes with chipotle ranch dressing.  She sat out a wine glass and proceeded to dump (I mean that literally) a full and generous 9 ounce pour into it. She was awesome all night and I loved her personality!  

Chardonnay was $12\/ glass and the crab cakes were $10.99 which was fair, especially for airport fare which can be pricey in some cities due to the ol' ""supply and demand"" rule.   The crab cakes were tasty, but the ranch was a bit overpowering and the bed of lettuce the crab cakes were served on was a little brown and wilted.  It should be noted that, while they had ceramic plates, patrons are given black plastic forks and knives to dine with.

This Phillips Seafood location has 1 TV on each end of the bar and a few hanging in other areas of the restaurant, but on this night they had the same programming on all of them and the channel selection wasn't the best.),(I told my husband to take me to the most expensive place!  So he takes me to the airport!!   De duh dum!

If you find yourself in the C concourse, check out Phillips Seafood.  They card everyone, good for the ego, til you see the big sign that reads: We I.D. All Guest!  Decent $10 bloody mary.),(Phillips was located right across from my gate. I was early so I decided to grab a bite and have a view close enough to not get left. The service was quick. A server quickly asked me for my drink order and brought it out. After ordering the food it came shortly after. I had the Buffalo Shrimp and cole slaw. This is my first time ever having Buffalo Shrimp and I enjoyed them. The restaurant had lots of seating. A bar, high top tables and regular tables. Several people came in after I sat down so the area got crowded really fast. After the crowd gathered my server may have forgotten about me. I had to go find her because my flight was boarding. It's a nice place to grab a bite if you are hungry and don't want to stray far from your gate.),(It was really early, like not even 6 am early and after a night without dinner or snacks, I wanted to sit down in a nicer restaurant. I love seafood, so I picked Phillips.

I should have known from the sign that said Pasterized Crab Meat. I'm a crab lover and being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I always have access to fresh crab. This was not the case. 

With a limited menu, I ordered the Cream of Crab Soup and an Ice Tea. It came up fast and service was friendly, but the soup was wayyyy over seasoned and the crab tasted dehydrated. Biting into crab chunks that seemed to break apart like powder chunks. I stopped trying to eat it after about 5 spoonfuls. 

I drank about 2 large ice teas and 2 large waters to get the overpowering salty seasoning taste from my mouth. The unsweetened ice tea is good, yet not worth stopping in when there is a lot offered in this airport. 

The worse part is the aftermath of a stomachache and sick feeling that lasted for the next 10-12 hours. If I wasn't already feeling tired and hungry, add sick to that and it wasn't worth it at all.  

Even if you like canned crab, I wouldn't recommend Phillips for anyone.),(Flight delayed and starving so I stopped by this place for my seafood fix. Wow masculine bartender female, you're really a (insert word of your choice here).

Yes, there's nothing worse when you know someone is only nice to you so they can get your money. So when you order at the bar ""to-go"" and they completely ignore you and won't even get you the glass of water they offered you while waiting, it just confirms what I said before. 

You can totally tell their fake customer service and their fake chit-chat small talk is a poor attempt to solicit tips.

I had the crab cakes & egg breakfast combo. It smelled weird and turned me of but for the price I forced myself to eat it on the plane, and the food itself, is okay....),(The service was fast and that is what you want at the airport.  This is a branch from the main location and it just isn't the same.  The seafood wasn't the freshest and the flavor wasn't the best. For the location, it was ok.)"

Queen Park Social, though a bit further out from Uptown than I normally venture, is located on a fun little strip of breweries and other social hang out spots and is great for group activities.  There's stuff that caters to everyone here, including bowling and cornhole, both of which I partook in during my particular visit.

The staff are relatively friendly, though I had to wait an extra good 5+ min or so while the lady behind the bowling counter chatted with her friend who was also at the counter, who I'm not even sure was buying anything.  She almost pretended like I wasn't there.  Oh well.  Prices are fair.  I think we paid $40 something dollars for an hour of bowling which I guess is kind of expensive for a city like Charlotte.  Shoes are required, but apparently you don't actually have to put them on.

Cornhole only requires you leave your drivers license up at the front desk and they give you the bean bags.  I believe there were 2-3 sets of cornhole outside in the back.  They have some lighting back there so you can still play at night.  Love cornhole!

Ambience was decent on a Wednesday night... it was a summer night and people didn't have school, so there was a decent amount of people, but it was definitely not crowded.  I think the group of 15-20 or so we had made the night.  There was music, but nothing blaring in your ears like some of the other reviewers state - maybe because it was a weekday?  

I can't comment on the food since we didn't have any of it, but the drinks were flowing all night.  Service was decent.

Great place for group events, but be ready to shell out a little.)"

But in all seriousness, Picasso's has some of the best food when it comes to sports bars. The wings are just fantastic. They also have killer pizza rolls that come in a whole mess of flavors. Anything from your standard pepperoni to Philly cheesesteak. I have had each variety and they are all equally delicious. They also have great drink specials throughout the week.

Picasso's is just a short walk from Bank of America Stadium. It's a great place for pre and post game drinks and eats. It's not the fanciest place by any means, but the atmosphere is always fun and full of excitement.

There are some great people that work here. I have been coming here for years to watch Nebraska games. They always take such good care of us. All super nice. I have never had a bad experience when it comes to the staff.

A new bonus for this location is the Romare Bearden Park that just opened across the street. It's absolutely gorgeous. The new Knights stadium will also open near here in the Spring.

Then again, this one is in an airport so I guess higher prices are expected. The food is OK. You would probably get more bang for your buck here than some of the other places. The service was a little slow though, especially when people have planes to catch. I felt bad for flagging someone down to get our check but we had been sitting for well over an hour before getting our check. Luckily our gate was nearby so we could book it to catch our flight if we had to. We also met an interesting guy sitting next to us here. I think if servers keep in  mind that most people are waiting for flights this would make people much happier.),(This Chili's Too! sure beats the one in the DFW airport (though that is not saying much).  It is bigger, and they have much more variety on their menu.  The one drawback--with the size of the restaurant, it is easy to get forgotten.

I went with the fajitas, which were okay for airport food.  This Chili's Too! also features cute waitresses with great Southern accents.),(The only reason we ate here was because we hadn't eaten since 7am, were supposed to fly out at 7:30am but it was now 2pm, and we both had bad cases of traveler's diarrhea and hoped for a fresh wrap or turkey sandwich that wouldn't tear up our insides.

It was very crowded, and there was even a wait to be seated.  This is not your traditional Chili's menu, only certain dishes are served.  Chili's Too should be called ""Chili's Light.""

Our food tasted the same as any Chili's restaurant, but the price was hiked up.  $10 for a sandwich is irritating when the only other option is a $7 deli sandwich at the grab-n-go types of shops in the airport.

Not a whole lot of time or room for relaxation or having drinks and chatting.)"
